The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system.

This automation has two advantages: First, it will free the neural network designer from indicating the complete covariance matrix, and second, it will result in a network with better generalization ability than the original model. A variation of the famous two-spiral problem and real-world examples from the UCI Machine Learning Repository will show a classification rate not only better than the original probabilistic neural network but also that this model can outperform other well-known classification techniques.","doi":"10.1162/089976602753633448","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1194","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789477/06790013.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602753633448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the Kernel Functions in a Probabilistic Neural Network Analyzing the Local Pattern Distribution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the Kernel Functions in a Probabilistic Neural Network Analyzing the Local Pattern Distribution","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2002","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the Kernel Functions in a Probabilistic Neural Network Analyzing the Local Pattern Distribution","sourcePdf":"089976602753633448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072468S","chronDate":"May 1 2002","isNumber":"6789477","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6790013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6790020,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslaw Galicki","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Statistics, Computer Sciences and Documentation, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany, and Department of Management, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Podg\u00f3rna 50, Poland, galicki@imsid.uni-jena.de"],"firstName":"Miroslaw","lastName":"Galicki"},{"name":"Lutz Leistritz","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Statistics, Computer Sciences and Documentation, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany, i6lelu@imsid.uni-jena.de"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Leistritz"},{"name":"Ernst Bernhard Zwick","affiliation":["Department of Pediatric Orthopedics, Karl-Franzens-University, Graz, Austria, ernst.zwick@kfunigraz.ac.at"],"firstName":"Ernst Bernhard","lastName":"Zwick"},{"name":"Herbert Witte","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Statistics, Computer Sciences and Documentation, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany, iew@imsid.uni-jena.de"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Witte"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790020","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790020","abstract":"This work addresses the problem of improving the generalization capabilities of continuous recurrent neural networks.

In terms of computational time and accuracy, the hybrid SIR is a clear improvement over conventional sequential Monte Carlo techniques. The new algorithm may be viewed as a global optimization strategy that allows us to learn the probability distributions of the network weights and outputs in a sequential framework. It is well suited to applications involving on-line, nonlinear, and nongaussian signal processing. We show how the new algorithm outperforms extended Kalman filter training on several problems. In particular, we address the problem of pricing option contracts, traded in financial markets. In this context, we are able to estimate the one-step-ahead probability density functions of the options prices.","doi":"10.1162/089976600300015664","startPage":"955","endPage":"993","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789427/06790037.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976600300015664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Monte Carlo Methods to Train Neural Network Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April 1 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2000","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Monte Carlo Methods to Train Neural Network Models","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Monte Carlo Methods to Train Neural Network Models","sourcePdf":"089976600300015664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018431S","chronDate":"April 1 2000","isNumber":"6789427","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"42","articleId":"6790037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790076,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Campolucci","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Automatica, Universit\u00e0 di Ancona, 60121 Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Campolucci"},{"name":"Aurelio Uncini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Automatica, Universit\u00e0 di Ancona, 60121 Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Aurelio","lastName":"Uncini"},{"name":"Francesco Piazza","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Automatica, Universit\u00e0 di Ancona, 60121 Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Piazza"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790076","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Signal-Flow-Graph Approach to On-line Gradient Calculation","abstract":"A large class of nonlinear dynamic adaptive systems such as dynamic recurrent neural networks can be effectively represented by signal flow graphs (SFGs). By this method, complex systems are described as a general connection of many simple components, each of them implementing a simple one-input, one-output transformation, as in an electrical circuit. Even if graph representations are popular in the neural network community, they are often used for qualitative description rather than for rigorous representation and computational purposes. In this article, a method for both on-line and batch-backward gradient computation of a system output or cost function with respect to system parameters is derived by the SFG representation theory and its known properties. The system can be any causal, in general nonlinear and time-variant, dynamic system represented by an SFG, in particular any feedforward, time-delay, or recurrent neural network. In this work, we use discrete-time notation, but the same theory holds for the continuous-time case. The gradient is obtained in a straightforward way by the analysis of two SFGs, the original one and its adjoint (obtained from the first by simple transformations), without the complex chain rule expansions of derivatives usually employed. This method can be used for sensitivity analysis and for learning both off-line and on-line. On-line learning is particularly important since it is required by many real applications, such as digital signal processing, system identification and control, channel equalization, and predistortion.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789479/06790076.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1927","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976600300015196","doi":"10.1162/089976600300015196","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug. 1 2000","displayDocTitle":"A Signal-Flow-Graph Approach to On-line Gradient Calculation","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2000","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Signal-Flow-Graph Approach to On-line Gradient Calculation","sourcePdf":"089976600300015196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027461S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2000","isNumber":"6789479","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6790076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6790090,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Fiori","affiliation":["Neural Networks and Adaptive System Research Group, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Fiori"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790090","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790090","doi":"10.1162/089976601750265036","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","abstract":"Recently we introduced the concept of neural network learning on Stiefel-Grassman manifold for multilayer perceptron\u2014like networks.

This bound is shown to hold for discrete center-surround receptive field neurons, which are physiologically relevant models of cells in the mammalian visual system, for neurons computing a difference of gaussians, which are popular in computational vision, and for standard RBF neurons, a major alternative to sigmoidal neurons in artificial neural networks. The result for RBF neural networks is of particular interest since it answers a question that has been open for several years. The results also give rise to lower bounds for networks with fixed input dimension. Regarding constants, all bounds are larger than those known thus far for similar architectures with sigmoidal neurons. The superlinear lower bounds contrast with linear upper bounds for single local receptive field neurons also derived here.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602317319018","startPage":"919","endPage":"956","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789512/06790116.pdf","doi":"10.1162/089976602317319018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Networks with Local Receptive Fields and Superlinear VC Dimension","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April 1 2002","displayDocTitle":"Neural Networks with Local Receptive Fields and Superlinear VC Dimension","publicationDate":"1 April 2002","volume":"14","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Networks with Local Receptive Fields and Superlinear VC Dimension","sourcePdf":"089976602317319018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017982S","chronDate":"April 1 2002","isNumber":"6789512","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6790116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790128,"authors":[{"name":"Laurenz Wiskott","affiliation":["Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, CA 92168, U.S.A.; Institute for Advanced Studies, D-14193, Berlin, Germany; and Innovationskolleg Theoretische Biologie, Institute for Biology, Humboldt-University Berlin, D-10115 Berlin, Germany, l.wiskott@biologie.hu-berlin.de"],"firstName":"Laurenz","lastName":"Wiskott"},{"name":"Terrence J.

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.","doi":"10.1162/089976602317318938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602317318938","startPage":"715","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789512/06790128.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow Feature Analysis: Unsupervised Learning of Invariances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April 1 2002","displayDocTitle":"Slow Feature Analysis: Unsupervised Learning of Invariances","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 April 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow Feature Analysis: Unsupervised Learning of Invariances","sourcePdf":"089976602317318938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040987S","chronDate":"April 1 2002","isNumber":"6789512","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"186","articleId":"6790128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6790148,"authors":[{"name":"Richard H.

In past theoretical studies, constraints on the synaptic connection patterns of threshold-linear networks were found that guaranteed bounded network dynamics, convergence to attractive fixed points, and multistability, all fundamental aspects of cortical information processing. However, these conditions were only sufficient, and it remained unclear which were the minimal (necessary) conditions for convergence and multistability. We show that symmetric threshold-linear networks converge to a set of attractive fixed points if and only if the network matrix is copositive. Furthermore, the set of attractive fixed points is nonconnected (the network is multiattractive) if and only if the network matrix is not positive semidefinite. There are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a stable steady state and forbidden sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden. By viewing permitted sets as memories stored in the synaptic connections, we provide a formulation of long-term memory that is more general than the traditional perspective of fixed-point attractor networks. There is a close correspondence between threshold-linear networks and networks defined by the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations.","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789360/06790148.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permitted and Forbidden Sets in Symmetric Threshold-Linear Networks","doi":"10.1162/089976603321192103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976603321192103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1 2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2003","displayDocTitle":"Permitted and Forbidden Sets in Symmetric Threshold-Linear Networks","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 March 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permitted and Forbidden Sets in Symmetric Threshold-Linear Networks","sourcePdf":"089976603321192103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0255S","chronDate":"March 1 2003","isNumber":"6789360","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"23","articleId":"6790148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790153,"authors":[{"name":"Lehel Csat\u00f3","affiliation":["Neural Computing Research Group, Department of Information Engineering, Aston University, B4 7ET Birmingham, U.

Yet a general and tractable computational model of this ability to untangle the underlying factors of perceptual observations remains elusive (Hofstadter, 1985). Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Ghahramani, 1995; Bell & Sejnowski, 1995; Hinton, Dayan, Frey, & Neal, 1995; Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Hinton & Ghahramani, 1997) are either insufficiently rich to capture the complex interactions of perceptually meaningful factors such as phoneme and speaker accent or letter and font, or do not allow efficient learning algorithms. We present a general framework for learning to solve two-factor tasks using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations of factor interactions but can nonetheless be fit to data using efficient algorithms based on the singular value decomposition and expectation-maximization. We report promising results on three different tasks in three different perceptual domains: spoken vowel classification with a benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation of fonts to unseen letters, and translation of faces to novel illuminants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June 1 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2000","publicationDate":"1 June 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"12","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Separating Style and Content with Bilinear Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separating Style and Content with Bilinear Models","sourcePdf":"089976600300015349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038592S","chronDate":"June 1 2000","isNumber":"6789294","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"225","articleId":"6790155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6790165,"authors":[{"name":"Emilio Salinas","affiliation":["Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1010, U.S.A., esalinas@wfubmc.edu"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Salinas"},{"name":"Terrence J.

However, analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically, so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrate-and-Fire Neurons Driven by Correlated Stochastic Input","doi":"10.1162/089976602320264024","endPage":"2155","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789343/06790165.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"2111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602320264024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Integrate-and-Fire Neurons Driven by Correlated Stochastic Input","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept. 1 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2002","volume":"14","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrate-and-Fire Neurons Driven by Correlated Stochastic Input","sourcePdf":"089976602320264024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021388S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2002","isNumber":"6789343","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6790165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6790172,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Bertschinger","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Computer Science, Technische Universitaet Graz, A-8010 Graz, Austria nilsb@igi.tugraz.at"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Bertschinger"},{"name":"Thomas Natschl\u00e4ger","affiliation":["Software Compentence Center Hagenberg, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria Thomas.Natschlaeger@scch.at"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Natschl\u00e4ger"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790172","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790172","abstract":"Depending on the connectivity, recurrent networks of simple computational units can show very different types of dynamics, ranging from totally ordered to chaotic. We analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a time-varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution of the connectivity matrix. In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789391","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789391/06790172.pdf","doi":"10.1162/089976604323057443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976604323057443","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Computation at the Edge of Chaos in Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790172/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Computation at the Edge of Chaos in Recurrent Neural Networks","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Computation at the Edge of Chaos in Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"089976604323057443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03883S","chronDate":"July 1 2004","isNumber":"6789391","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"32","articleId":"6790172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790180,"authors":[{"name":"Uri T.

To understand how neural systems adapt the irrepresentations of biological information, analyses of receptive field plasticity from experimental measurements are crucial. Adaptive signal processing, the well-established engineering discipline for characterizing the temporal evolution of system parameters, suggests a framework for studying the plasticity of receptive fields. We use the Bayes' rule Chapman-Kolmogorov paradigm with a linear state equation and point process observation models to derive adaptive filters appropriate for estimation from neural spike trains. We derive point process filter analogues of the Kalman filter, recursive least squares, and steepest-descent algorithms and describe the properties of these new fil-ters. We illustrate our algorithms in two simulated data examples. The first is a study of slow and rapid evolution of spatial receptive fields in hippocampal neurons. The second is an adaptive decoding study in which a signal is decoded from ensemble neural spiking activity as the recep-tive fields of the neurons in the ensemble evolve. Our results provide a paradigm for adaptive estimation for point process observations and suggest a practical approach for constructing filtering algorithms to track neural receptive field dynamics on a millisecond timescale.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Analysis of Neural Encoding by Point Process Adaptive Filtering","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/089976604773135069","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789616/06790180.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976604773135069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789616","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1 2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2004","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Analysis of Neural Encoding by Point Process Adaptive Filtering","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 May 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Analysis of Neural Encoding by Point Process Adaptive Filtering","sourcePdf":"089976604773135069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017398S","chronDate":"May 1 2004","isNumber":"6789616","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"81","articleId":"6790180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790205,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Zibulevsky","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zibulevsky"},{"name":"Barak A.

We consider the general case of more sources than mixtures, but also derive a more efficient algorithm in the case of a nonovercomplete dictionary and an equal numbers of sources and mixtures.

Using the domain of text to model object recognition in cluttered scenes, we show that with corrections for the nonuniform probability and nonindependence of text features, the analytical model achieves good fits to measured recognition rates in simulations involving a wide range of clutter loads, word sizes, and feature counts. We then introduce a greedy algorithm for feature learning, derived from the analytical model, which grows a representation by choosing those conjunctive features that are most likely to distinguish objects from the cluttered backgrounds in which they are embedded. We show that the representations produced by this algorithm are compact, decorrelated, and heavily weighted toward features of low conjunctive order. Our results provide a more quantitative basis for understanding when spatially invariant conjunctive features can support unambiguous perception in multiobject scenes, and lead to several insights regarding the properties of visual representations optimized for specific recognition tasks.","doi":"10.1162/089976600300015574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976600300015574","startPage":"731","endPage":"762","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789427/06790219.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing Binding Errors Using Learned Conjunctive Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April 1 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2000","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Binding Errors Using Learned Conjunctive Features","publicationDate":"1 April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790219/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Binding Errors Using Learned Conjunctive Features","sourcePdf":"089976600300015574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024079S","chronDate":"April 1 2000","isNumber":"6789427","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6790219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790220,"authors":[{"name":"Hideyuki C\u00e2teau","affiliation":["Core Research for the Evolutional Science and Technology Program, JST, Tokyo 1948610, Japan, cateau@brain.inf.eng.tamagawa.ac.jp"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"C\u00e2teau"},{"name":"Tomoki Fukai","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Tamagawa University and CREST, JST, Tokyo 1948610, Japan, tfukai@eng.tamagawa.ac.jp"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Fukai"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790220","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Synapses in various neural preparations exhibit spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a variety of learning window functions. The window functions determine the magnitude and the polarity of synaptic change according to the time difference of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Numerical experiments revealed that STDP learning with a single-expo nential window function resulted in a bimodal distribution of synaptic conductances as a consequence of competition between synapses. A slightly modified window function, however, resulted in a unimodal distribution rather than a bimodal distribution. Since various window functions have been observed in neural preparations, we develop a rigorous mathematical method to calculate the conductance distribution for any given window function. Our method is based on the Fokker-Planck equation to determine the conductance distribution and on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to characterize the membrane potential fluctuations. Demonstrating that our method reproduces the known quantitative results of STDP learning, we apply the method to the type of STDP learning found recently in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. We find that this learning can result in nearly optimized competition between synapses. Meanwhile, we find that the type of STDP learning found in the cerebellum-like structure of electric fish can result in all-or-none synapses: either all the synaptic conductances are maximized, or none of them becomes significantly large. Our method also determines the window function that optimizes synaptic competition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Method to Predict the Consequence of Arbitrary Forms of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity","doi":"10.1162/089976603321192095","endPage":"620","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789360/06790220.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976603321192095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Method to Predict the Consequence of Arbitrary Forms of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1 2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2003","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 March 2003","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Method to Predict the Consequence of Arbitrary Forms of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity","sourcePdf":"089976603321192095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038727S","chronDate":"March 1 2003","isNumber":"6789360","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6790220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6790226,"authors":[{"name":"James M.

Various methods for estimating a recovering matrix have been proposed and applied to data in many fields, such as biological signal processing, communication engineering, and financial market data analysis. One problem these methods have is that they are often too sensitive to outliers, and the existence of a few outliers might change the estimate drastically. In this article, we propose a robust method of blind source separation based on the\u03b2 divergence. Shift parameters are explicitly included in our model instead of the conventional way which assumes that original signals have zero mean. The estimator gives smaller weights to possible outliers so that their influence on the estimate is weakened. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator significantly improves the performance over the existing methods when outliers exist; it keeps equal performance otherwise.","doi":"10.1162/089976602760128045","startPage":"1859","endPage":"1886","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789336/06790228.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602760128045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Blind Source Separation by Beta Divergence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug. 1 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2002","displayDocTitle":"Robust Blind Source Separation by Beta Divergence","volume":"14","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Blind Source Separation by Beta Divergence","sourcePdf":"089976602760128045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019118S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2002","isNumber":"6789336","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6790228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6790241,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Trapletti","affiliation":["Department of Operations Research, Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, A-1090 Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Trapletti"},{"name":"Friedrich Leisch","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, A-1040 Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Leisch"},{"name":"Kurt Hornik","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Probability Theory, Vienna University of Technology, A-1040 Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Hornik"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790241","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790241","abstract":"We consider autoregressive neural network (AR-NN) processes driven by additive noise and demonstrate that the characteristic roots of the shortcuts\u2014the standard conditions from linear time-series analysis\u2014determine the stochastic behavior of the overall AR-NN process.

Given any set of statistically independent source signals, it is conjectured here that a linear mixture of those signals has the following property: the temporal predictability of any signal mixture is less than (or equal to) that of any of its component source signals. It is shown that this property can be used to recover source signals from a set of linear mixtures of those signals by finding an un-mixing matrix that maximizes a measure of temporal predictability for each recovered signal.

This leads to the existence of a global optimum that can be easily obtained solving linear systems of equations or linear programming problems, using much less computational power than the one associated with the standard methods. Another version of the method allows computing a large set of estimates for the weights, providing robust, mean or median, estimates for them, and the associated standard errors, which give a good measure for the quality of the fit. Later, the standard one-layer neural network algorithms are improved by learning the neural functions instead of assuming them known. A set of examples of applications is used to illustrate the methods. Finally, a comparison with other high-performance learning algorithms shows that the proposed methods are at least 10 times faster than the fastest standard algorithm used in the comparison.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June 1 2002","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2002","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Global Optimum Approach for One-Layer Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Global Optimum Approach for One-Layer Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"089976602753713007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028913S","chronDate":"June 1 2002","isNumber":"6789347","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6790325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6790335,"authors":[{"name":"Tianping Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Nonlinear Mathematics Science, Institute of Mathematics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, tchen@fudan.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Tianping","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Wenlian Lu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Nonlinear Mathematics Science, Institute of Mathematics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, chiquitita@21cn.com"],"firstName":"Wenlian","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Shun-ichi Amari","affiliation":["RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-01, Japan, amari@brain.riken.go.jp"],"firstName":"Shun-ichi","lastName":"Amari"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790335","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790335","doi":"10.1162/089976602760805359","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6789503/06790335.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"2947","endPage":"2957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6789503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602760805359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Convergence Rate of Recurrently Connected Neural Networks","abstract":"We discuss recurrently connected neural networks, investigating their global exponential stability (GES).

In this article, we present a new recurrent neural network architecture, that is capable of significantly improved parameter sensitivity properties compared to existing recurrent neural networks. The new recurrent neural network generalizes previous architectures by employing alternative discrete-time operators in place of the shift operator normally used. An analysis of the model demonstrates the existence of parameter sensitivity in recurrent neural networks and supports the proposed architecture.

These results parallel that for the one-node pattern recognition problem\u2014that determining the optimal weights for a threshold logic node is also intractable. Our results have important consequences for constructive algorithms that build a regression model one node at a time. It suggests that although such methods are (in principle) capable of producing efficient size representations (Barron, 1993; Jones, 1992), finding such representations may be computationally intractable. These results holds only in the deterministic sense; that is, they do not exclude the possibility that such representations may be found efficiently with high probability. In fact it motivates the use of heuristic or randomized algorithms for this problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6790419/06790452.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1260","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/089976699300016449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976699300016449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training a Sigmoidal Node Is Hard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1 1999","displayDocTitle":"Training a Sigmoidal Node Is Hard","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 1999","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training a Sigmoidal Node Is Hard","sourcePdf":"089976699300016449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023086S","chronDate":"July 1 1999","isNumber":"6790419","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6790452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790463,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Greenish","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, 3480 University Street, Montr\u00e9al, Qc, Canada H3A 2A7"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Greenish"},{"name":"Vincent Hayward","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, 3480 University Street, Montr\u00e9al, Qc, Canada H3A 2A7, hayward@cim.mcgill.ca"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Hayward"},{"name":"Vanessa Chial","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD"],"firstName":"Vanessa","lastName":"Chial"},{"name":"Allison Okamura","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD"],"firstName":"Allison","lastName":"Okamura"},{"name":"Thomas Steffen","affiliation":["Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Steffen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1054-7460"}],"articleNumber":"6790463","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790463","doi":"10.1162/105474602321050749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/105474602321050749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790396","publicationTitle":"Presence","displayPublicationTitle":"Presence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720227/6790396/06790463.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement, Analysis, and Display of Haptic Signals During Surgical Cutting","abstract":"The forces experienced while surgically cutting anatomical tissues from a sheep and two rats were investigated for three scissor types. Data were collected in situ using instrumented Mayo, Metzenbaum, and Iris scissors immediately after death to minimize postmortem effects. The force-position relationship, the frequency components present in the signal, the significance of the cutting rate, and other invariant properties were investigated after segmentation of the data into distinct task phases. Measurements were found to be independent of the cutting speed for Mayo and Metzenbaum scissors, but the results for Iris scissors were inconclusive. Sensitivity to cutting tissues longitudinally or transversely depended on both the tissue and on the scissor type. Data from cutting three tissues (rat skin, liver, and tendon) with Metzenbaum scissors as well as blank runs were processed and displayed as haptic recordings through a custom-designed haptic interface. Experiments demonstrated that human subjects could identify tissues with similar accuracy when performing a real or simulated cutting task. The use of haptic recordings to generate the simulations was simple and efficient, but it lacked flexibility because only the information obtained during data acquisition could be displayed.

These representations are used to navigate reactively in simulations involving obstacle avoidance and pursuit of a moving target. The network's weights are trained during an action-perception cycle in which self-generated eye and body movements produce optic flow information, thus allowing the network to tune itself without requiring explicit knowledge of sensor geometry. The confounding effect of eye movement during translation is suppressed by learning the relationship between eye movement outflow commands and the optic flow signals that they induce. The remaining optic flow field is due to only observer translation and independent motion of objects in the scene. A self-organizing feature map categorizes normalized translational flow patterns, thereby creating a map of cells that code heading directions. Heading information is then recombined with translational flow patterns in two different ways to form maps of scene depth and moving object locations. Most of the learning processes take place concurrently and evolve through unsupervised learning. Mapping the learned heading representations onto heading labels or motor commands requires additional structure. Simulations of the network verify its performance using both noise-free and noisy optic flow information.","doi":"10.1162/089976698300017782","startPage":"313","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976698300017782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790391","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6790391/06790497.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Organizing Neural Network Architecture for Navigation Using Optic Flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790497/","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Organizing Neural Network Architecture for Navigation Using Optic Flow","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 15 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb. 15 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Organizing Neural Network Architecture for Navigation Using Optic Flow","sourcePdf":"089976698300017782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041704S","chronDate":"Feb. 15 1998","isNumber":"6790391","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6790497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790500,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-ichi Amari","affiliation":["RIKEN Frontier Research Program, Saitama 351-01, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun-ichi","lastName":"Amari"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790500","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":556,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790500","abstract":"When a parameter space has a certain underlying structure, the ordinary gradient of a function does not represent its steepest direction, but the natural gradient does.

The dynamical behavior of natural gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so serious when the natural gradient is used.

Unfortunately, the user's virtual experience is compromised by the narrow field of view (FOV) it affords, which is less than half that of normal human vision. This paper explores a solution to some of the problems caused by the narrow FOV by amplifying the head movement made by the user when wearing an HMD, so that the view direction changes by a greater amount in the virtual world than it does in the real world. Tests conducted on the technique show a significant improvement in performance on a visual search task, and questionnaire data indicate that the altered visual parameters that the user receives may be preferable to those in the baseline condition in which amplification of movement was not implemented. The tests also show that the user cannot interact normally with the VE if corresponding body movements are not amplified to the same degree as head movements, which may limit the implementation's versatility. Although not suitable for every application, the technique shows promise, and alterations to aspects of the implementation could extend its use in the future.","doi":"10.1162/105474603765879521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/105474603765879521","startPage":"268","endPage":"276","displayPublicationTitle":"Presence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720227/6790507/06790517.pdf","publicationTitle":"Presence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplifying Head Movements with Head-Mounted Displays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2003","displayDocTitle":"Amplifying Head Movements with Head-Mounted Displays","publicationDate":"June 2003","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790517/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplifying Head Movements with Head-Mounted Displays","sourcePdf":"105474603765879521.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01732S","chronDate":"June  2003","isNumber":"6790507","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720227","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6790517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6790537,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90024, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Arun Jagota","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 94704, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Jagota"},{"name":"Fernanda Botelho","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Fernanda","lastName":"Botelho"},{"name":"Max Garzon","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"Garzon"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790537","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790537","abstract":"For a given recurrent neural network, a discrete-time model may have asymptotic dynamics different from the one of a related continuous-time model.

These techniques, though fairly general, ignore the specific nature of neuronal processing in terms of its known biophysical properties. However, a systematic study of processing at various stages in a biophysically faithful model of a single neuron can identify the role of each stage in information transfer. Toward this end, we carry out a theoretical analysis of the information loss of a synaptic signal propagating along a linear, one-dimensional, weakly active cable due to neuronal noise sources along the way, using both a signal reconstruction and a signal detection paradigm. Here we begin such an analysis by quantitatively characterizing three sources of membrane noise: (1) thermal noise due to the passive membrane resistance, (2) noise due to stochastic openings and closings of voltage-gated membrane channels (Na\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n and K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n), and (3) noise due to random, background synaptic activity.

While nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity by a combination of local linear PCA projections. However, conventional PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCA models. Therefore, previous attempts to formulate mixture models for PCA have been ad hoc to some extent. In this article, PCA is formulated within a maximum likelihood framework, based on a specific form of gaussian latent variable model. This leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal component analyzers, whose parameters can be determined using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We discuss the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modeling, and local dimensionality reduction, and we demonstrate its application to image compression and handwritten digit recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb. 15 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 15 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"15 Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"11","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers","sourcePdf":"089976699300016728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027966S","chronDate":"Feb. 15 1999","isNumber":"6790471","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"407","articleId":"6790561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6790586,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, PIN 208 016, India, deb@iitk.ac.in"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb"},{"name":"Hans-Georg Beyer","affiliation":["Systems Analysis Group, Department of Computer Science XI, University of Dort-mund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany, beyer@zappa.cs.uni-dortmund.de"],"firstName":"Hans-Georg","lastName":"Beyer"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6790586","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790586","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-adaptation","genetic algorithms","simulated binary crossover","blend crossover","real-coded GAs","evolution strategies"]}],"abstract":"Self-adaptation is an essential feature of natural evolution.

A bound on the generalization error for the combined predictors in terms of their maximum error is proven that is sharper than bounds to date.

Most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) developed in the past decade are either good for achieving a well-distributed solutions at the expense of a large computational effort or computationally fast at the expense of achieving a not-so-good distribution of solutions. For example, although the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm or SPEA (Zitzler and Thiele, 1999) produces a much better distribution compared to the elitist non-dominated sorting GA or NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002a), the computational time needed to run SPEA is much greater. In this paper, we evaluate a recently-proposed steady-state MOEA (Deb et al., 2003) which was developed based on the \u03f5-dominance concept introduced earlier (Laumanns et al., 2002) and using efficient parent and archive update strategies for achieving a well-distributed and well-converged set of solutions quickly. Based on an extensive comparative study with four other state-of-the-art MOEAs on a number of two, three, and four objective test problems, it is observed that the steady-state MOEA is a good compromise in terms of convergence near to the Pareto-optimal front, diversity of solutions, and computational time. Moreover, the \u03f5-MOEA is a step closer towards making MOEAs pragmatic, particularly allowing a decision-maker to control the achievable accuracy in the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the \u03f5-Domination Based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for a Quick Computation of Pareto-Optimal Solutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the \u03f5-Domination Based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for a Quick Computation of Pareto-Optimal Solutions","sourcePdf":"106365605774666895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018149S","chronDate":"2005","isNumber":"6790541","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"115","articleId":"6790645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790646,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo P.

Using maximum likelihood estimation of nongaussian variables corrupted by gaussian noise, we show how to apply a soft-thresholding (shrinkage) operator on the components of sparse coding so as to reduce noise. Our method is closely related to the method of wavelet shrinkage, but it has the important benefit over wavelet methods that the representation is determined solely by the statistical properties of the data. The wavelet representation, on the other hand, relies heavily on certain mathematical properties (like self-similarity) that may be only weakly related to the properties of natural data.","doi":"10.1162/089976699300016214","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6790393/06790710.pdf","startPage":"1739","endPage":"1768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976699300016214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Code Shrinkage: Denoising of Nongaussian Data by Maximum Likelihood Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct. 1 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790710/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Code Shrinkage: Denoising of Nongaussian Data by Maximum Likelihood Estimation","volume":"11","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Code Shrinkage: Denoising of Nongaussian Data by Maximum Likelihood Estimation","sourcePdf":"089976699300016214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027332S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 1999","isNumber":"6790393","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"97","articleId":"6790710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790726,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeev Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur 721 302, India, rkumar@cse.iitkgp.ernet.in"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Kumar"},{"name":"Peter Rockett","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield S1 3JD, UK, p.rockett@sheffield.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Rockett"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6790726","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790726","abstract":"Previous work on multiobjective genetic algorithms has been focused on preventing genetic drift and the issue of convergence has been given little attention. In this paper, we present a simple steady-state strategy, Pareto Converging Genetic Algorithm (PCGA), which naturally samples the solution space and ensures population advancement towards the Pareto-front. PCGA eliminates the need for sharing/niching and thus minimizes heuristically chosen parameters and procedures. A systematic approach based on histograms of rank is introduced for assessing convergence to the Pareto-front, which, by definition, is unknown in most real search problems. We argue that there is always a certain inheritance of genetic material belonging to a population, and there is unlikely to be any significant gain beyond some point; a stopping criterion where terminating the computation is suggested. For further encouraging diversity and competition, a nonmigrating island model may optionally be used; this approach is particularly suited to many difficult (real-world) problems, which have a tendency to get stuck at (unknown) local minima. Results on three benchmark problems are presented and compared with those of earlier approaches.

Convergence of the parameter estimate to a particular value cannot be guaranteed under our assumptions. We then evaluate the asymptotic distribution of the distance between the parameter estimate and its nearest neighbor among the set of minima of the generalization error. Results on this question have appeared numerous times and generally assert asymptotic normality, the conclusion expected from familiar statistical arguments concerned with maximum likelihood estimators. These conclusions are usually reached on the basis of somewhat informal calculations, although we shall see that the situation is somewhat delicate.

Many studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the Pareto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. However, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has a proof of convergence to the true Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. In this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier MOEAs do not have such properties. Based on the concept of \u03b5-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to MOEAs that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. A number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested.

This ARNN consists of finite number of neurons; each neuron computes a polynomial net function and a sigmoid-like continuous activation function. We introduce arithmetic networks as ARNN augmented with a few simple discontinuous (e.g., threshold or zero test) neurons. We argue that even with weights restricted to polynomial time computable reals, arithmetic networks are able to compute arbitrarily complex recursive functions. We identify many types of neural networks that are at least as powerful as arithmetic nets, some of which are not in fact discontinuous, but they boost other arithmetic operations in the net function (e.g., neurons that can use divisions and polynomial net functions inside sigmoid-like continuous activation functions). These arithmetic networks are equivalent to the Blum-Shub-Smale model, when the latter is restricted to a bounded number of registers. With respect to implementation on digital computers, we show that arithmetic networks with rational weights can be simulated with exponential precision, but even with polynomial-time computable real weights, arithmetic networks are not subject to any fixed precision bounds. This is in contrast with the ARNN that are known to demand precision that is linear in the computation time. When nontrivial periodic functions (e.g., fractional part, sine, tangent) are added to arithmetic networks, the resulting networks are computationally equivalent to a massively parallel machine. Thus, these highly discontinuous networks can solve the presumably intractable class of PSPACE-complete problems in polynomial time.","doi":"10.1162/089976699300016638","startPage":"715","endPage":"745","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6790461/06790796.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976699300016638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discontinuities in Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April 1 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 1999","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuities in Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discontinuities in Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"089976699300016638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086074S","chronDate":"April 1 1999","isNumber":"6790461","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6790796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6790808,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Brunel","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Physique Statistique de I'E.N.S., \u2020 Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Brunel"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Nadal","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Physique Statistique de I'E.N.S., \u2020 Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Nadal"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6790808","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790808","doi":"10.1162/089976698300017115","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6790370/06790808.pdf","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976698300017115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Information, Fisher Information, and Population Coding","abstract":"In the context of parameter estimation and model selection, it is only quite recently that a direct link between the Fisher information and information-theoretic quantities has been exhibited.

Furthermore, we examine the time needed to synchronize such networks. We observe that these networks synchronize at times proportional to the logarithm of their size, and we give the parameters used to control the rate of synchronization. Inspired by locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator network (LEGION) dynamics with relaxation oscillators (Terman & Wang, 1995), we find that global inhibition can play a similar role of desynchronization in a network of integrate-and-fire oscillators.

However, little is known regarding how information may come to be temporally encoded and about the potential computational advantages of temporal coding. Here, it is shown that local inhibition may underlie the temporal encoding of spatial images. As a result of inhibition, the response of a given cell can be significantly modulated by stimulus features outside its own receptive field. Feedforward and lateral inhibition can modulate both the firing rate and temporal features, such as latency. In this article, it is shown that a simple neural network model can use local inhibition to generate temporal codes of handwritten numbers. The temporal encoding of a spatial patterns has the interesting and computationally beneficial feature of exhibiting position invariance. This work demonstrates a manner by which the nervous system may generate temporal codes and shows that temporal encoding can be used to create position-invariant codes.","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6790417/06790901.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Model of Temporal Code Generation and Position-Invariant Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1162/089976699300016836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/089976699300016836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6790901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6790901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan. 1 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 1999","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Model of Temporal Code Generation and Position-Invariant Pattern Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Model of Temporal Code Generation and Position-Invariant Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"089976699300016836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023256S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 1999","isNumber":"6790417","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6790901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6791024,"authors":[{"name":"Uday Kumar Chakraborty","affiliation":["Reader Department of Computer Science and Engineering Jadavpur University Calcutta 700032, India uday@jadav.ernet.in"],"firstName":"Uday Kumar","lastName":"Chakraborty"},{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Assistant Professor Department of Mechanical Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, UP 208016, India deb@iitk.ernet.in"],"firstName":"Kalyanmoy","lastName":"Deb"},{"name":"Mandira Chakraborty","affiliation":["Lecturer Department of Computer Science and Engineering Jadavpur University Calcutta 700032, India mc@jadav.ernet.in"],"firstName":"Mandira","lastName":"Chakraborty"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6791024","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","evolution strategies","selection","takeover","Markov chain"]}],"abstract":"A Markov chain framework is developed for analyzing a wide variety of selection techniques used in genetic algorithms (GAs) and evolution strategies (ESs).

The framework is used to illuminate relationships between seemingly different probabilistic perspectives of SGA behavior. Next, the SGA is formalized as an instance of random heuristic search. The formalization then used to show expected population fitness is a Lyapunov function in the infinite population model when mutation is zero and fitness is linear. In particular, the infinite population algorithm must converge, and average population fitness increases from one generation to the next. The consequence for a finite population SGA is that the expected population fitness increases from one generation to the next. Moreover, the only stable fixed point of the expected next population operator corresponds to the population consisting entirely of the optimal string.

FOX-GA's contributions are to demonstrate an effective application of GA technology to a complex real world planning problem, and to provide an understanding of the properties needed in a GA solution to meet the challenges of decision support in complex domains. Previous obstacles to applying GA technology to maneuver planning include the lack of efficient algorithms for determining the fitn ess of plans. Detailed simulations would ideally be used to evaluate these plans, but most such simulations typically require several hours to assess a single plan. Since a GA needs to quickly generate and evaluate thousands of plans, these methods are too slow. To solve this problem we developed an efficient evaluator (wargamer) that uses course-grained representations of this problem domain to allow appropriate yet intelligent trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. An additional challenge was that users needed a diverse set of significantly different plan options from which to choose. Typical GA's tend to develop a group of \u201cbest\u201d solutions that may be very similar (or identical) to each other. This may not provide users with sufficient choice. We addressed this problem by adding a niching strategy to the selection mechanism to insure diversity in the solution set, providing users with a more satisfactory range of choices. FOX-GA's impact will be in providing decision support to time constrained and cognitively overloaded battlestaff to help them rapidly explore options, create plans, and better cope with the information demands of modern warfare.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6791587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"FOX-GA: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating and Analyzing Battlefield Courses of Action","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FOX-GA: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating and Analyzing Battlefield Courses of Action","sourcePdf":"evco19997145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029508S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"6790962","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6791587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6791661,"authors":[{"name":"Gary J.

In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAs) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAs in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAs along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-principle results obtained on three problems used by Schaffer and others suggest that the proposed method can be extended to higher dimensional and more difficult multiobjective problems. A number of suggestions for extension and application of the algorithm are also discussed.","doi":"10.1162/evco.1994.2.3.221","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791343/06791727.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1994.2.3.221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Muiltiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6791727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Muiltiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6791727/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Muiltiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"evco199423221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043965S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"6791343","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"962","articleId":"6791727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6791768,"authors":[{"name":"Heinz M\u00fchlenbein","affiliation":["GMD Schloss Birlinghoven D-53754 Sankt Augustin muehlen@gmd.de"],"firstName":"Heinz","lastName":"M\u00fchlenbein"},{"name":"Dirk Schlierkamp-Voosen","affiliation":["GMD Schloss Birlinghoven D-53754 Sankt Augustin"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Schlierkamp-Voosen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6791768","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4},"doi":"10.1162/evco.1993.1.4.335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6791768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1993.1.4.335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791267","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791267/06791768.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Science of Breeding and Its Application to the Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA)","abstract":"The breeder genetic algorithm (BGA) models artificial selection as performed by human breeders.

Most research in this area has understandably concentrated on the selection stage of EAs, due to the need to integrate vectorial performance measures with the inherently scalar way in which EAs reward individual performance, that is, number of offspring. In this review, current multiobjective evolutionary approaches are discussed, ranging from the conventional analytical aggregation of the different objectives into a single function to a number of population-based approaches and the more recent ranking schemes based on the definition of Pareto optimality. The sensitivity of different methods to objective scaling and/or possible concavities in the trade-off surface is considered, and related to the (static) fitness landscapes such methods induce on the search space. From the discussion, directions for future research in multiobjective fitness assignment and search strategies are identified, including the incorporation of decision making in the selection procedure, fitness sharing, and adaptive representations.","doi":"10.1162/evco.1995.3.1.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1995.3.1.1","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6790957/06791888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6790957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of Evolutionary Algorithms in Multiobjective Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6791888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Evolutionary Algorithms in Multiobjective Optimization","volume":"3","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Evolutionary Algorithms in Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"evco1995311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021464S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"6790957","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"347","articleId":"6791888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6791906,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gruau","affiliation":["D\u00e9partment de Recherche Fondamentale, Matiere Condens\u00e9e, CEA CENG, SP2M PSC BP 85X 38041 Grenoble, France gruau@drfmc.ceng.cea.fr"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Gruau"},{"name":"Darrell Whitley","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Colorado State University Fort Collins, CO 80523 whitley@cs.colostate.edu"],"firstName":"Darrell","lastName":"Whitley"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6791906","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural networks","learning developmental system","cellular encoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6791906","abstract":"A grammar tree is used to encode a cellular developmental process that can generate whole families of Boolean neural networks for computing parity and symmetry.

The problem is complex and highly constrained. We show that it can be successfully solved by division into two subproblems and solving each using a separate genetic algorithm (GA). We address the problem of whether this produces locally optimal solutions and how to overcome this. We extend the traditional approach of evolving a \u201cpermutation + schedule builder\u201d by concentrating on evolving the schedule builder itself. This results in a unique schedule builder being built for each daily scheduling problem, each individually tailored to deal with the particular features of that problem. This results in a robust, fast, and flexible system that can cope with most of the circumstances imaginable at the factory. We also compare the performance of a GA approach to several other evolutionary methods and show that population-based methods are superior to both hill-climbing and simulated annealing in the quality of solutions produced. Population-based methods also have the distinct advantage of producing multiple, equally fit solutions, which is of particular importance when considering the practical aspects of the problem.","doi":"10.1162/evco.1998.6.1.61","startPage":"61","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791150/06791991.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1998.6.1.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving a Real-World Problem Using an Evolving Heuristically Driven Schedule Builder","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolving schedule builder","heuristics","constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6791991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1998","displayDocTitle":"Solving a Real-World Problem Using an Evolving Heuristically Driven Schedule Builder","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1998","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving a Real-World Problem Using an Evolving Heuristically Driven Schedule Builder","sourcePdf":"evco19986161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035791S","chronDate":"March  1998","isNumber":"6791150","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6791991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6791998,"authors":[{"name":"Harpal Maini","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science 4-116 Center for Science and Technology Syracuse University Syracuse, NY 13244-4100 hsmaini@top.cis.syr.edu"],"firstName":"Harpal","lastName":"Maini"},{"name":"Kishan Mehrotra","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science 4-116 Center for Science and Technology Syracuse University Syracuse, NY 13244-4100 kishan@top.cis.syr.edu"],"firstName":"Kishan","lastName":"Mehrotra"},{"name":"Chilukuri Mohan","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science 4-116 Center for Science and Technology Syracuse University Syracuse, NY 13244-4100 mohan@top.cis.syr.edu"],"firstName":"Chilukuri","lastName":"Mohan"},{"name":"Sanjay Ranka","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science 4-116 Center for Science and Technology Syracuse University Syracuse, NY 13244-4100 ranka@top.cis.syr.edu"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Ranka"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6791998","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithms","soft-decision decoding","uniform crossover"]}],"doi":"10.1162/evco.1994.2.2.145","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791029/06791998.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1994.2.2.145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6791998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Soft-Decision Decoding of Linear Block Codes","abstract":"Soft-decision decoding is an NP-hard problem of great interest to developers of communication systems.

We address these phenomena by carrying out experiments with groups of two simulated robots controlled by neural networks whose connection weights are evolved by using genetic algorithms. These algorithms and controllers are well suited to autonomously find solutions for decentralized collective robotic tasks based on principles of self-organization. The article first presents a taxonomy of role-taking and specialization mechanisms related to evolved neural network controllers. Then it introduces two cooperation tasks, which can be accomplished by either role taking or specialization, and uses these tasks to compare four different genetic algorithms to evaluate their capacity to evolve a suitable behavioral strategy, which depends on the task demands. Interestingly, only one of the four algorithms, which appears to have more biological plausibility, is capable of evolving role taking or specialization when they are needed. The results are relevant for both collective robotics and biology, as they can provide useful hints on the different processes that can lead to the emergence of specialization in robots and organisms.","doi":"10.1162/ARTL_a_00106","startPage":"221","endPage":"253","displayPublicationTitle":"Artificial Life","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720217/6792049/06792050.pdf","publicationTitle":"Artificial Life","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/ARTL_a_00106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6792049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Different Genetic Algorithms and the Evolution of Specialization: A Study with Groups of Simulated Neural Robots","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperation","role taking and specialization","individual and group selection","temporary and stable groups","evolutionary regimes","navigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Different Genetic Algorithms and the Evolution of Specialization: A Study with Groups of Simulated Neural Robots","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Different Genetic Algorithms and the Evolution of Specialization: A Study with Groups of Simulated Neural Robots","sourcePdf":"artl_a_00106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022901S","chronDate":"April  2013","isNumber":"6792049","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720217","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6792050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6792174,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Tuson","affiliation":["Department of Artificial Intelligence University of Edinburgh 5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh EH1 2QL, U.K andrewt@dai.ed.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Tuson"},{"name":"Peter Ross","affiliation":["Department of Artificial Intelligence University of Edinburgh 5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh EH1 2QL, U.K. peter@dai.ed.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Ross"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6792174","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-evolution,operator adaptation","COBRA","self-adaptation","operator settings"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6792174","abstract":"In the majority of genetic algorithm implementations, the operator settings are fixed throughout a given run.

Based on the proposed theory, it is argued that the similarities of candidate solutions should be exploited directly, rather than encoding candidate solutions and then exploiting their similarities. Proportional selection is characterized as a global search operator, and recombination is characterized as the search process that exploits similarities. Sequential algorithms and many deletion methods are also analyzed.

To fully illustrate the LCS/NN analogy used in this paper, an LCS-like NN is implemented and tested. The test is constructed to run parallel to a similar GA/NN study that did not employ a co-adaptive GA. The test illustrates the LCS/NN analogy and suggests an interesting new method for applying GAs in NNs.

Here we present some of the work that has aided in getting a clear insight in the scalability problems of simple genetic algorithms. Particularly, we discuss the important issue of building block mixing. We show how the need for mixing places a boundary in the GA parameter space that, together with the boundary from the schema theorem, delimits the region where the GA converges reliably to the optimum in problems of bounded difficulty. This region shrinks rapidly with increasing problem size unless the building blocks are tightly linked in the problem coding structure. In addition, we look at how straightforward extensions of the simple genetic algorithm\u2014namely elitism, niching, and restricted mating are not significantly improving the scalability problems.","doi":"10.1162/evco.1999.7.4.331","startPage":"331","endPage":"352","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791272/06792511.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1999.7.4.331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability Problems of Simple Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","scalability problems","mixing analysis","linkage problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Scalability Problems of Simple Genetic Algorithms","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability Problems of Simple Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"evco199974331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02487S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"6791272","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6792511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6792619,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Peters","affiliation":["*Center For New Music and Audio Technologies, University of California, Berkeley, 1750 Arch Street, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. nils@icsi.berkeley.edu"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Peters"},{"name":"Trond Lossius","affiliation":["\u2020BEK, Bergen Center for Electronic Arts, C.

A synthetic vision system is proposed to tackle the problem of collision recognition in dynamic environments. The system combines the outputs of four whole-field motion-detecting neurons, each receiving inputs from a network of neurons employing asymmetric lateral inhibition to suppress their responses to one direction of motion. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to adjust the weights between the four motion-detecting neurons to tune the system to detect collisions in two test environments. To do this, a population of agents, each representing a proposed synthetic visual system, either were shown images generated by a mobile Khepera robot navigating in a simplified laboratory environment or were shown images videoed outdoors from a moving vehicle. The agents had to cope with the local environment correctly in order to survive. After 400 generations, the best agent recognized imminent collisions reliably in the familiar environment where it had evolved. However, when the environment was swapped, only the agent evolved to cope in the robotic environment still signaled collision reliably. This study suggests that whole-field direction-selective neurons, with selectivity based on asymmetric lateral inhibition, can be organized into a synthetic vision system, which can then be adapted to play an important role in collision detection in complex dynamic scenes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Artificial Life","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720217/6791580/06792631.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"Artificial Life","doi":"10.1162/artl.2007.13.2.93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/artl.2007.13.2.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6792631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Synthetic Vision System Using Directionally Selective Motion Detectors to Recognize Collision","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic scene","direction selectivity","asymmetric lateral inhibition","collision","evolution","synthetic vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Synthetic Vision System Using Directionally Selective Motion Detectors to Recognize Collision","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Synthetic Vision System Using Directionally Selective Motion Detectors to Recognize Collision","sourcePdf":"artl200713293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03912S","chronDate":"April  2007","isNumber":"6791580","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720217","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6792631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6792721,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Igel","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, 44780 Bochum, Germany christian.igel@neuroinformatik.rub.de"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Igel"},{"name":"Nikolaus Hansen","affiliation":["Computational Laboratory (CoLab), Institute of Computational Science, ETH Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland nikolaus.hansen@inf.ethz.ch"],"firstName":"Nikolaus","lastName":"Hansen"},{"name":"Stefan Roth","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universit\u00fct Bochum, 44780 Bochum, Germany stefan.roth@neuroinformatik.rub.de"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Roth"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6792721","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","evolution strategy","covariance matrix adaptation"]}],"abstract":"The covariancematrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of themost powerful evolutionary algorithms for real-valued single-objective optimization. In this paper, we develop a variant of the CMA-ES for multi-objective optimization (MOO). We first introduce a single-objective, elitist CMA-ES using plus-selection and step size control based on a success rule. This algorithm is compared to the standard CMA-ES. The elitist CMA-ES turns out to be slightly faster on unimodal functions, but is more prone to getting stuck in sub-optimal local minima. In the new multi-objective CMAES (MO-CMA-ES) a population of individuals that adapt their search strategy as in the elitist CMA-ES is maintained. These are subject to multi-objective selection. The selection is based on non-dominated sorting using either the crowding-distance or the contributing hypervolume as second sorting criterion. Both the elitist single-objective CMA-ES and the MO-CMA-ES inherit important invariance properties, in particular invariance against rotation of the search space, from the original CMA-ES. The benefits of the new MO-CMA-ES in comparison to the well-known NSGA-II and to NSDE, a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, are experimentally shown.","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791258/06792721.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covariance Matrix Adaptation for Multi-objective Optimization","doi":"10.1162/evco.2007.15.1.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.2007.15.1.1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6792721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Covariance Matrix Adaptation for Multi-objective Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covariance Matrix Adaptation for Multi-objective Optimization","sourcePdf":"evco20071511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018426S","chronDate":"March  2007","isNumber":"6791258","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"119","articleId":"6792721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6792724,"authors":[{"name":"Shengxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK, s.yang@mcs.le.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Shengxiang","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6792724","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","dynamic optimization problems","memory","random immigrants","memory-based immigrants","elitism-based immigrants"]}],"doi":"10.1162/evco.2008.16.3.385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6792724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.2008.16.3.385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791140","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791140/06792724.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms with Memory- and Elitism-Based Immigrants in Dynamic Environments","abstract":"In recent years the genetic algorithm community has shown a growing interest in studying dynamic optimization problems. Several approaches have been devised. The random immigrants and memory schemes are two major ones. The random immigrants scheme addresses dynamic environments by maintaining the population diversity while the memory scheme aims to adapt genetic algorithms quickly to new environments by reusing historical information. This paper investigates a hybrid memory and random immigrants scheme, called memory-based immigrants, and a hybrid elitism and random immigrants scheme, called elitism-based immigrants, for genetic algorithms in dynamic environments. In these schemes, the best individual from memory or the elite from the previous generation is retrieved as the base to create immigrants into the population by mutation. This way, not only can diversity be maintained but it is done more efficiently to adapt genetic algorithms to the current environment. Based on a series of systematically constructed dynamic problems, experiments are carried out to compare genetic algorithms with the memory-based and elitism-based immigrants schemes against genetic algorithms with traditional memory and random immigrants schemes and a hybrid memory and multi-population scheme. The sensitivity analysis regarding some key parameters is also carried out. Experimental results show that the memory-based and elitism-based immigrants schemes efficiently improve the performance of genetic algorithms in dynamic environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms with Memory- and Elitism-Based Immigrants in Dynamic Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms with Memory- and Elitism-Based Immigrants in Dynamic Environments","sourcePdf":"evco2008163385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019319S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"6791140","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"50","articleId":"6792724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6792767,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

To ascertain the optimization of the genotypeto-phenotype mapping by the CGA, we also conduct analytical experiments for some problems while observing the basin size of a global optimum solution in the binary genotype space.

This is not a criticism of GAs, but rather a reflection of choices made regarding the level of abstraction at which biological mechanisms are modeled, and a reflection of the more engineering-oriented goals of the evolutionary computation community. Understanding better and reducing this gap between GAs and genetics has been a central issue in an interdisciplinary project whose goal is to build GA-based computational models of viral evolution. The result is a system called Virtual Virus (VIV). VIV incorporates a number of more biologically plausible mechanisms, including a more flexible genotype-to-phenotype mapping. In VIV the genes are independent of position, and genomes can vary in length and may contain noncoding regions, as well as duplicative or competing genes. Initial computational studies with VIV have already revealed several emergent phenomena of both biological and computational interest. In the absence of any penalty based on genome length, VIV develops individuals with long genomes and also performs more poorly (from a problem-solving viewpoint) than when a length penalty is used. With a fixed linear length penalty, genome length tends to increase dramatically in the early phases of evolution and then decrease to a level based on the mutation rate. The plateau genome length (i.e., the average length of individuals in the final population) generally increases in response to an increase in the base mutation rate. When VIV converges, there tend to be many copies of good alternative genes within the individuals. We observed many instances of switching between active and inactive genes during the entire evolutionary process. These observations support the conclusion that noncoding regions serve as scratch space in which VIV can explore alternative gene values. These results represent a positive step in understanding how GAs might exploit more of the power and flexibility of biological evolution while simultaneously providing better tools for understanding evolving biological systems.","doi":"10.1162/evco.1998.6.4.387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1998.6.4.387","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791621/06792923.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Putting More Genetics into Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Putting More Genetics into Genetic Algorithms","volume":"6","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Putting More Genetics into Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"evco199864387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064748S","chronDate":"Dec.  1998","isNumber":"6791621","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6792923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6792975,"authors":[{"name":"Erick Cant\u00fa-Paz","affiliation":["Center for Applied Scientific Computing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory P.O.

The objective is to determine the optimal number of processors that can be used by each type to minimize the execution time. The first part of the paper considers algorithms with a single population. The investigation focuses on an implementation where the population is distributed to several processors, but the results are applicable to more common masterslave implementations, where the population is entirely stored in a master processor and multiple slaves are used to evaluate the fitness. The second part of the paper deals with parallel GAs with multiple populations. It first considers a bounding case where the connectivity, the migration rate, and the frequency of migrations are set to their maximal values. Then, arbitrary regular topologies with lower migration rates are considered and the frequency of migrations is set to its lowest value. The investigationis mainly theoretical, but experimental evidence with an additively-decomposable function is included to illustrate the accuracy of the theory. In all cases, the calculations show that the optimal number of processors that minimizes the execution time is directly proportional to the square root of the population size and the fitness evaluation time. Since these two factors usually increase as the domain becomes more difficult, the results of the paper suggest that parallel GAs can integrate large numbers of processors and significantly reduce the execution time of many practical applications.","doi":"10.1162/evco.1999.7.4.429","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791272/06792975.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1999.7.4.429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Scalability of Parallel Genetic Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6792975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792975/","displayDocTitle":"On the Scalability of Parallel Genetic Algorithms","volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Scalability of Parallel Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"evco199974429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030057S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"6791272","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6792975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6792987,"authors":[{"name":"Sanyou Y.

Firstly, these constraints are taken into account when determining Pareto dominance. As a result, a strict partial-ordered relation is obtained, and feasibility is not considered later in the selection process. Then, the orthogonal design and the statistical optimal method are generalized to MOPs, and a new type of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is constructed. In this framework, an original niche evolves first, and splits into a group of sub-niches. Then every sub-niche repeats the above process. Due to the uniformity of the search, the optimality of the statistics, and the exponential increase of the splitting frequency of the niches, OMOEA uses a deterministic search without blindness or stochasticity. It can soon yield a large set of solutions which converges to the Pareto-optimal set with high precision and uniform distribution. We take six test problems designed by Deb, Zitzler et al., and an engineering problem (W) with constraints provided by Ray et al. to test the new technique. The numerical experiments show that our algorithm is superior to other MOGAS and MOEAs, such as FFGA, NSGAII, SPEA2, and so on, in terms of the precision, quantity and distribution of solutions. Notably, for the engineering problem W, it finds the Pareto-optimal set, which was previously unknown.","doi":"10.1162/evco.2004.12.1.77","startPage":"77","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.2004.12.1.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791578","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791578/06792987.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Orthogonal Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Problems with Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6792987/","displayDocTitle":"An Orthogonal Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Problems with Constraints","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Orthogonal Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization Problems with Constraints","sourcePdf":"evco200412177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064196S","chronDate":"2004","isNumber":"6791578","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6792987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6792990,"authors":[{"name":"Walter Cede\u00f1o","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science University of California, Davis and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Livermore, CA 94550 wcedeno@llnl.gov"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Cede\u00f1o"},{"name":"V.

In addition, the effects of noncoding segments on both of these representations is studied. Noncoding segments are a computational model of noncoding deoxyribonucleic acid, and floating building blocks mimic the location independence of genes. The fact that these structures are prevalent in natural genetic systems suggests that they may provide some advantages to the evolutionary process. Our results show that there is a significant difference in how GAs solve a problem in the fixed and floating representations. Genetic algorithms are able to maintain a more diverse population with the floating representation. The combination of noncoding segments and floating building blocks appears to encourage a GA to take advantage of its parallel search and recombination abilities.","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6791023/06793017.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of the Fixed and Floating Building Block Representation in the Genetic Algorithm","doi":"10.1162/evco.1996.4.2.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6791023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.1996.4.2.169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1996","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of the Fixed and Floating Building Block Representation in the Genetic Algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of the Fixed and Floating Building Block Representation in the Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"evco199642169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053654S","chronDate":"June  1996","isNumber":"6791023","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6793017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793112,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Braun","affiliation":["Institute for Control and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, 44221, Germany. jan.braun@tu-dortmund.de"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Braun"},{"name":"Johannes Krettek","affiliation":["Institute for Control and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, 44221, Germany. johannes.krettek@tu-dortmund.de"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Krettek"},{"name":"Frank Hoffmann","affiliation":["Institute for Control and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, 44221, Germany. frank.hoffmann@tu-dortmund.de"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Hoffmann"},{"name":"Torsten Bertram","affiliation":["Chair for Control and Systems Engineering, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, 44221, Germany. torsten.bertram@tu-dortmund.de"],"firstName":"Torsten","lastName":"Bertram"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793112","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","fitness model","surrogate model","model assisted","surrogate assisted","data based model","evolutionary algorithm","evolution strategies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793112","abstract":"Evolutionary algorithms perform robust search in complex and high dimensional search spaces, but require a large number of fitness evaluations to approximate optimal solutions. These characteristics limit their potential for hardware in the loop optimization and problems that require extensive simulations and calculations. Evolutionary algorithms do not maintain their knowledge about the fitness function as they only store solutions of the current generation. In contrast, model assisted evolutionary algorithms utilize the information contained in previously evaluated solutions in terms of a data based model. The convergence of the evolutionary algorithm is improved as some selection decisions rely on the model rather than to invoke expensive evaluations of the true fitness function. The novelty of our scheme stems from the preselection of solutions based on an instance based fitness model, in which the selection pressure is adjusted to the quality of model. This so-called \u03bb-control adapts the number of true fitness evaluations to the monitored model quality. Our method extends the previous approaches for model assisted scalar optimization to multi-objective problems by a proper redefinition of model quality and preselection pressure control. The analysis on multi-objective benchmark optimization problems not only confirms the superior convergence of the model assisted evolution strategy in comparison with a multi-objective evolution strategy but also the positive effect of regulated preselection in contrast to merely static preselection.","doi":"10.1162/evco.2009.17.4.17408","startPage":"577","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.2009.17.4.17408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793111","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793111/06793112.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization with Controlled Model Assisted Evolution Strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793112/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization with Controlled Model Assisted Evolution Strategies","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization with Controlled Model Assisted Evolution Strategies","sourcePdf":"evco200917417408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03668S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"6793111","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","articleId":"6793112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6793135,"authors":[{"name":"Jos J.

We asked people to listen to utterances whose content sometimes did not match inferences based on the identity of the speaker (e.g., \u201cIf only I looked like Britney Spears\u201d in a male voice, or \u201cI have a large tattoo on my back\u201d spoken with an upper-class accent). Event-related brain responses revealed that the speaker's identity is taken into account as early as 200\u2013300 msec after the beginning of a spoken word, and is processed by the same early interpretation mechanism that constructs sentence meaning based on just the words. This finding is difficult to reconcile with standard \u201cGricean\u201d models of sentence interpretation in which comprehenders initially compute a local, context-independent meaning for the sentence (\u201csemantics\u201d) before working out what it really means given the wider communicative context and the particular speaker (\u201cpragmatics\u201d). Because the observed brain response hinges on voice-based and usually stereotype-dependent inferences about the speaker, it also shows that listeners rapidly classify speakers on the basis of their voices and bring the associated social stereotypes to bear on what is being said. According to our event-related potential results, language comprehension takes very rapid account of the social context, and the construction of meaning based on language alone cannot be separated from the social aspects of language use.

This property is of high interest and relevance for problems involving a large number of objective functions. However, the high computational effort required for hypervolume calculation has so far prevented the full exploitation of this indicator's potential; current hypervolume-based search algorithms are limited to problems with only a few objectives. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a fast search algorithm that uses Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the exact hypervolume values. The main idea is not that the actual indicator values are important, but rather that the rankings of solutions induced by the hypervolume indicator. In detail, we present HypE, a hypervolume estimation algorithm for multi-objective optimization, by which the accuracy of the estimates and the available computing resources can be traded off; thereby, not only do many-objective problems become feasible with hypervolume-based search, but also the runtime can be flexibly adapted. Moreover, we show how the same principle can be used to statistically compare the outcomes of different multi-objective optimizers with respect to the hypervolume\u2014so far, statistical testing has been restricted to scenarios with few objectives. The experimental results indicate that HypE is highly effective for many-objective problems in comparison to existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

It is now well understood that there is no one \u201coptimal choice\u201d; rather, the situation changes per problem instance and during evolution. This paper examines whether this choice can be left to the processes of evolution via self-adaptation, thus removing this nontrivial task from the GA user and reducing the risk of poor performance arising from (inadvertent) inappropriate decisions. Self-adaptation has been proven successful for mutation step sizes in the continuous domain, and for the probability of applying bitwise mutation to binary encodings; here we examine whether this can translate to the choice and parameterisation of mutation operators for permutation encodings. We examine one method for adapting the choice of operator during runtime, and several different methods for adapting the rate at which the chosen operator is applied. In order to evaluate these algorithms, we have used a range of benchmark TSP problems. Of course this paper is not intended to present a state of the art in TSP solvers; rather, we use this well known problem as typical of many that require a permutation encoding, where our results indicate that self-adaptation can prove beneficial. The results show that GAs using appropriate methods to self-adapt their mutation operator and mutation rate find solutions of comparable or lower cost than algorithms with \u201cstatic\u201d operators, even when the latter have been extensively pretuned. Although the adaptive GAs tend to need longer to run, we show that is a price well worth paying as the time spent finding the optimal mutation operator and rate for the nonadaptive versions can be considerable. Finally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the self-adaptive methods to changes in the implementation, and to the choice of other genetic operators and population models. The results show that the methods presented are robust, in the sense that the performance benefits can be obtained in a wide range of host algorithms.","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00006","startPage":"491","endPage":"514","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793196/06793359.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Adaptation of Mutation Operator and Probability for Permutation Representations in Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","self-adaptation","mutation","permutation encodings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-Adaptation of Mutation Operator and Probability for Permutation Representations in Genetic Algorithms","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Adaptation of Mutation Operator and Probability for Permutation Representations in Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018445S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","isNumber":"6793196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6793359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6793380,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Lehman","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida 32816, USA. jlehman@eecs.ucf.edu"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Lehman"},{"name":"Kenneth O.

Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00025","startPage":"189","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793379","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793379/06793380.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Abandoning Objectives: Evolution Through the Search for Novelty Alone","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793380/","displayDocTitle":"Abandoning Objectives: Evolution Through the Search for Novelty Alone","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Abandoning Objectives: Evolution Through the Search for Novelty Alone","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018107S","chronDate":"June  2011","isNumber":"6793379","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"86","articleId":"6793380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":6793400,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-ping Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. ypchen@nclab.tw"],"firstName":"Ying-ping","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Chao-Hong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. chchen@nclab.tw"],"firstName":"Chao-Hong","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793400","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793400","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation of distribution algorithm","EDA","ECGA","split-on-demand","SoD","real-parameter optimization","economic dispatch","valve point effect"]}],"doi":"10.1162/evco.2010.18.2.18202","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793399/06793400.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"199","endPage":"228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.2010.18.2.18202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm for Real-Parameter Optimization by Using Adaptive Discretization","abstract":"An adaptive discretization method, called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">split-on-demand</i>\n (SoD), enables estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) for discrete variables to solve continuous optimization problems. SoD randomly splits a continuous interval if the number of search points within the interval exceeds a threshold, which is decreased at every iteration. After the split operation, the nonempty intervals are assigned integer codes, and the search points are discretized accordingly. As an example of using SoD with EDAs, the integration of SoD and the extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) is presented and numerically examined. In this integration, we adopt a local search mechanism as an optional component of our back end optimization engine. As a result, the proposed framework can be considered as a memetic algorithm, and SoD can potentially be applied to other memetic algorithms. The numerical experiments consist of two parts: (1) a set of benchmark functions on which ECGA with SoD and ECGA with two well-known discretization methods: the fixed-height histogram (FHH) and the fixed-width histogram (FWH) are compared; (2) a real-world application, the economic dispatch problem, on which ECGA with SoD is compared to other methods. The experimental results indicate that SoD is a better discretization method to work with ECGA. Moreover, ECGA with SoD works quite well on the economic dispatch problem and delivers solutions better than the best known results obtained by other methods in existence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enabling the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm for Real-Parameter Optimization by Using Adaptive Discretization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm for Real-Parameter Optimization by Using Adaptive Discretization","sourcePdf":"evco201018218202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114961S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"6793399","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6793400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793401,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Grossberg","affiliation":["Boston University"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Grossberg"},{"name":"John W.L.

A neural network model suggests how such memory processes work together as recognition learning, reinforcement learning, and sensorimotor learning take place during adaptive behaviors. To coordinate these processes, the hippocampal formation and cerebellum each contains circuits that learn to adaptively time their outputs. Within the model, hippocampal timing helps to maintain attention on motivationally salient goal objects during variable task-related delays, and cerebellar timing controls the release of conditioned responses. This property is part of the model's description of how cognitive-emotional interactions focus attention on motivationally valued cues, and how this process breaks down due to hippocampal ablation. The model suggests that the hippocampal mechanisms that help to rapidly draw attention to salient cues could prematurely release motor commands were not the release of these commands adaptively timed by the cerebellum. The model hippocampal system modulates cortical recognition learning without actually encoding the representational information that the cortex encodes. These properties avoid the difficulties faced by several models that propose a direct hippocampal role in recognition learning. Learning within the model hippocampal system controls adaptive timing and spatial orientation. Model properties hereby clarify how hippocampal ablations cause amnesic symptoms and difficulties with tasks which combine task delays, novelty detection, and attention toward goal objects amid distractions. When these model recognition, reinforcement, sensorimotor, and timing processes work together, they suggest how the brain can accomplish conditioning of multiple sensory events to delayed rewards, as during serial compound conditioning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1996","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"July 1996","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Hippocampus and Cerebellum in Adaptively Timed Learning, Recognition, and Movement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Hippocampus and Cerebellum in Adaptively Timed Learning, Recognition, and Movement","sourcePdf":"jocn199683257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019399S","chronDate":"July  1996","isNumber":"6793227","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6793401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6793405,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory McCarthy","affiliation":["VA Medical Center, West Haven, CT and Yale University School of Medicine"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"McCarthy"},{"name":"Aina Puce","affiliation":["VA Medical Center, West Haven, CT and Yale University School of Medicine"],"firstName":"Aina","lastName":"Puce"},{"name":"John C.

However, their success depends on the quality of the generative model upon which they are built. For Fisher kernel techniques to be used on novel problems, a mechanism for creating accurate generative models is required. A novel framework is presented for automatically creating domain-specific generative models that can be used to produce Fisher kernels for support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernel methods. The framework enables the capture of prior knowledge and addresses the issue of domain-specific kernels, both of which are current areas that are lacking in many kernel-based methods. To obtain the generative model, genetic algorithms are used to evolve the structure of hidden Markov models (HMMs). A Fisher kernel is subsequently created from the HMM, and used in conjunction with an SVM, to improve the discriminative power. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the proposed method, named GA-SVM. We show that its performance is comparable if not better than other state of the art methods in classifying secretory protein sequences of malaria. More interestingly, it showed better results than the sequence-similarity-based approach, without the need for additional homologous sequence information in protein enzyme family classification. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the GA-SVM is a novel way to find features with good performance from biological sequences, that does not require extensive tuning of a complex model.","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793075/06793463.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving Fisher Kernels for Biological Sequence Classification","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequence data","hidden Markov models","genetic algorithms","Fisher kernels","support vector machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Evolving Fisher Kernels for Biological Sequence Classification","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving Fisher Kernels for Biological Sequence Classification","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061841S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6793075","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","articleId":"6793463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793469,"authors":[{"name":"Grit Hein","firstName":"Grit","lastName":"Hein"},{"name":"Robert T.

Several research areas claim the STS as the host brain region for their particular behavior of interest. Some see it as one of the core structures for theory of mind. For others, it is the main region for audiovisual integration. It plays an important role in biological motion perception, but is also claimed to be essential for speech processing and processing of faces. We review the foci of activations in the STS from multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, focusing on theory of mind, audiovisual integration, motion processing, speech processing, and face processing. The results indicate a differentiation of the STS region in an anterior portion, mainly involved in speech processing, and a posterior portion recruited by cognitive demands of all these different research areas. The latter finding argues against a strict functional subdivision of the STS. In line with anatomical evidence from tracer studies, we propose that the function of the STS varies depending on the nature of network coactivations with different regions in the frontal cortex and medial-temporal lobe. This view is more in keeping with the notion that the same brain region can support different cognitive operations depending on task-dependent network connections, emphasizing the role of network connectivity analysis in neuroimaging.","doi":"10.1162/jocn.2008.20148","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720218/6793216/06793469.pdf","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2008.20148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superior Temporal Sulcus\u2014It's My Area: Or Is It?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Superior Temporal Sulcus\u2014It's My Area: Or Is It?","volume":"20","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superior Temporal Sulcus\u2014It's My Area: Or Is It?","sourcePdf":"jocn200820148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019657S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","isNumber":"6793216","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6793469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6793500,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Elhossini","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada. aelhossi@uoguelph.ca"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elhossini"},{"name":"Shawki Areibi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada. sareibi@uoguelph.ca"],"firstName":"Shawki","lastName":"Areibi"},{"name":"Robert Dony","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada. rdony@uoguelph.ca"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Dony"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793500","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","particle swarm optimization","evolutionary algorithms","strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1162/evco.2010.18.1.18105","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/evco.2010.18.1.18105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793083","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793083/06793500.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strength Pareto Particle Swarm Optimization and Hybrid EA-PSO for Multi-Objective Optimization","abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique that can handle multi-objective optimization problems.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.","doi":"10.1162/jocn.1991.3.1.71","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720218/6793213/06793549.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.1991.3.1.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigenfaces for Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Eigenfaces for Recognition","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenfaces for Recognition","sourcePdf":"jocn19913171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032208S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"6793213","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","citationCount":"4290","articleId":"6793549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6793588,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Bringmann","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. s9kabrin@stud.uni-saarland.de"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Bringmann"},{"name":"Tobias Friedrich","affiliation":["Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. tobias.friedrich@mpi-inf.mpg.de"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Friedrich"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793588","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00012","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793196/06793588.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Algorithm for Computing Hypervolume Contributions<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\"><sup>*</sup></xref>","abstract":"The hypervolume indicator serves as a sorting criterion in many recent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).

As part of crossover, random mating is often carried out. A novel approach to parent mating is presented in this work. Our novel approach can be applied in combination with a traditional similarity-based criterion to measure distance between individuals or with a fitness-based criterion. We introduce a parameter called the mating index that allows different mating strategies to be developed within a uniform framework: an exploitative strategy called best-first, an explorative strategy called best-last, and an adaptive strategy called self-adaptive. Self-adaptive mating is defined in the context of the novel algorithm, and aims to achieve a balance between exploitation and exploration in a domain-independent manner. The present work formally defines the novel mating approach, analyzes its behavior, and conducts an extensive experimental study to quantitatively determine its benefits. In the domain of real function optimization, the experiments show that, as the degree of multimodality of the function at hand grows, increasing the mating index improves performance. In the case of the self-adaptive mating strategy, the experiments give strong results for several case studies.","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00067","startPage":"197","endPage":"229","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793719/06793720.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Mating Approach for Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","premature convergence","mating strategies","mating index","self-adaptive mating"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Mating Approach for Genetic Algorithms","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Mating Approach for Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024532S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6793719","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6793720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793724,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Girelli","affiliation":["University of Iowa"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Girelli"},{"name":"Steven J.

To test this hypothesis, we recorded the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform during visual search tasks with color, orientation, and motion targets. The N2pc component has previously been shown to reflect a specific attentional mechanism that is present for color and form targets, and we sought to determine whether this component would also be present for motion targets. The N2pc component was indeed observed for motion targets as well as color and orientation targets, consistent with the use of a common attentional mechanism across feature types.

Each subproblem corresponds to one weighted aggregation function. For example, MOEA/D is an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm that attempts to optimize multiple subproblems simultaneously by evolving a population of solutions. However, the performance of MOEA/D highly depends on the initial setting and diversity of the weight vectors. In this paper, we present an improved version of MOEA/D, called EMOSA, which incorporates an advanced local search technique (simulated annealing) and adapts the search directions (weight vectors) corresponding to various subproblems. In EMOSA, the weight vector of each subproblem is adaptively modified at the lowest temperature in order to diversify the search toward the unexplored parts of the Pareto-optimal front. Our computational results show that EMOSA outperforms six other well established multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms on both the (constrained) multi-objective knapsack problem and the (unconstrained) multi-objective traveling salesman problem. Moreover, the effects of the main algorithmic components and parameter sensitivities on the search performance of EMOSA are experimentally investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Approach Based on Simulated Annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Approach Based on Simulated Annealing","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054277S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6793222","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"57","articleId":"6793746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793748,"authors":[{"name":"Vui Ann Shim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 117576, Singapore g0800438@nus.edu.sg"],"firstName":"Vui Ann","lastName":"Shim"},{"name":"Kay Chen Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 117576, Singapore eletankc@nus.edu.sg"],"firstName":"Kay Chen","lastName":"Tan"},{"name":"Jun Yong Chia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 117576, Singapore g0900313@nus.edu.sg"],"firstName":"Jun Yong","lastName":"Chia"},{"name":"Abdullah Al Mamun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 117576, Singapore eleaam@nus.edu.sg"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Al Mamun"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793748","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793748","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation of distribution algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","multi-objective optimization","noisy fitness function","particle swarm optimization","restricted Boltzmann machine"]}],"doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00066","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793075/06793748.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"149","endPage":"177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization with Estimation of Distribution Algorithm in a Noisy Environment","abstract":"Many real-world optimization problems are subjected to uncertainties that may be characterized by the presence of noise in the objective functions. The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), which models the global distribution of the population for searching tasks, is one of the evolutionary computation techniques that deals with noisy information. This paper studies the potential of EDAs; particularly an EDA based on restricted Boltzmann machines that handles multi-objective optimization problems in a noisy environment. Noise is introduced to the objective functions in the form of a Gaussian distribution. In order to reduce the detrimental effect of noise, a likelihood correction feature is proposed to tune the marginal probability distribution of each decision variable. The EDA is subsequently hybridized with a particle swarm optimization algorithm in a discrete domain to improve its search ability. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined via eight benchmark instances with different characteristics and shapes of the Pareto optimal front. The scalability, hybridization, and computational time are rigorously studied. Comparative studies show that the proposed approach outperforms other state of the art algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization with Estimation of Distribution Algorithm in a Noisy Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization with Estimation of Distribution Algorithm in a Noisy Environment","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04826S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6793075","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"11","articleId":"6793748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793867,"authors":[{"name":"David Hadka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 dmh309@psu.edu"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hadka"},{"name":"Patrick Reed","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 pmr11@engr.psu.edu"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Reed"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793867","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793867","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary algorithm","multi-objective optimization","many-objective optimization","multimodal problems","\u03f5-dominance"]}],"abstract":"This study introduces the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for many-objective, multimodal optimization.

To this end, evolutionary optimization algorithms (EA) stand as viable methodologies mainly due to their ability to find and capture multiple solutions within a population in a single simulation run. With the preselection method suggested in 1970, there has been a steady suggestion of new algorithms. Most of these methodologies employed a niching scheme in an existing single-objective evolutionary algorithm framework so that similar solutions in a population are deemphasized in order to focus and maintain multiple distant yet near-optimal solutions. In this paper, we use a completely different strategy in which the single-objective multimodal optimization problem is converted into a suitable bi-objective optimization problem so that all optimal solutions become members of the resulting weak Pareto-optimal set. With the modified definitions of domination and different formulations of an artificially created additional objective function, we present successful results on problems with as large as 500 optima. Most past multimodal EA studies considered problems having only a few variables. In this paper, we have solved up to 16-variable test problems having as many as 48 optimal solutions and for the first time suggested multimodal constrained test problems which are scalable in terms of number of optima, constraints, and variables. The concept of using bi-objective optimization for solving single-objective multimodal optimization problems seems novel and interesting, and more importantly opens up further avenues for research and application.","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793342/06793893.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Optimization Using a Bi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimodal optimization","bi-objective optimization","NSGA-II","Hooke-Jeeves exploratory search","multimodal constrained optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Optimization Using a Bi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Optimization Using a Bi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055634S","chronDate":"March  2012","isNumber":"6793342","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"26","articleId":"6793893","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6793896,"authors":[{"name":"Lam T.

Although it has been shown to perform well in finding the optimal solutions for many optimization problems, there has so far been little analysis on how it works in detail. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the QPSO algorithm. In the theoretical analysis, we analyze the behavior of a single particle in QPSO in terms of probability measure. Since the particle's behavior is influenced by the contraction-expansion (CE) coefficient, which is the most important parameter of the algorithm, the goal of the theoretical analysis is to find out the upper bound of the CE coefficient, within which the value of the CE coefficient selected can guarantee the convergence or boundedness of the particle's position. In the experimental analysis, the theoretical results are first validated by stochastic simulations for the particle's behavior. Then, based on the derived upper bound of the CE coefficient, we perform empirical studies on a suite of well-known benchmark functions to show how to control and select the value of the CE coefficient, in order to obtain generally good algorithmic performance in real world applications. Finally, a further performance comparison between QPSO and other variants of PSO on the benchmarks is made to show the efficiency of the QPSO algorithm with the proposed parameter control and selection methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"20","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization: Analysis of Individual Particle Behavior and Parameter Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization: Analysis of Individual Particle Behavior and Parameter Selection","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023506S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","isNumber":"6793071","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"55","articleId":"6793922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6793935,"authors":[{"name":"David Hadka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802 dmh309@psu.edu"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hadka"},{"name":"Patrick Reed","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802 pmr11@engr.psu.edu"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Reed"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6560"}],"articleNumber":"6793935","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6793935","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","multiobjective optimization","many-objective optimization","search control","parameterization"]}],"doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00053","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793071/06793935.pdf","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","startPage":"423","endPage":"452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnostic Assessment of Search Controls and Failure Modes in Many-Objective Evolutionary Optimization","abstract":"The growing popularity of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for solving many-objective problems warrants the careful investigation of their search controls and failure modes.

One algorithm is proposed in the paper. At each iteration, the decision maker is asked to give preference information in terms of his or her reference point consisting of desirable aspiration levels for objective functions. The information is used in an evolutionary algorithm to generate a new population by combining the fitness function and an achievement scalarizing function. In multi-objective optimization, achievement scalarizing functions are widely used to project a given reference point into the Pareto optimal set. In our approach, the next population is thus more concentrated in the area where more preferred alternatives are assumed to lie and the whole Pareto optimal set does not have to be generated with equal accuracy. The approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6793977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Preference-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Preference-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization","sourcePdf":"evco2009173411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025774S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","isNumber":"6793435","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"66","articleId":"6793977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6794050,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper specifically draws attention to the fact that assessing model accuracy is a crucial aspect in the meta-modeling framework. Resampling strategies such as cross-validation, subsampling, bootstrapping, and nested resampling are prominent methods for model validation and are systematically discussed with respect to possible pitfalls, shortcomings, and specific features. A survey of meta-modeling techniques within evolutionary optimization is provided. In addition, practical examples illustrating some of the pitfalls associated with model selection and performance assessment are presented.

As a result, such GAs are often confronted with feasibility and memory-efficiency problems. With the aircraft sequencing problem (ASP) as a study case, this paper reports on a novel binary-representation-based GA scheme for combinatorial problems. Unlike existing GAs for the ASP, which typically use permutation representations based on aircraft landing order, the new GA introduces a novel ripple-spreading model which transforms the original landing-order-based ASP solutions into value-based ones. In the new scheme, arriving aircraft are projected as points into an artificial space. A deterministic method inspired by the natural phenomenon of ripple-spreading on liquid surfaces is developed, which uses a few parameters as input to connect points on this space to form a landing sequence. A traditional GA, free of feasibility and memory-efficiency problems, can then be used to evolve the ripple-spreading related parameters in order to find an optimal sequence. Since the ripple-spreading model is the centerpiece of the new algorithm, it is called the ripple-spreading GA (RSGA). The advantages of the proposed RSGA are illustrated by extensive comparative studies for the case of the ASP.","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00011","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/6793177/06794051.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"106","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6793177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ripple-Spreading Genetic Algorithm for the Aircraft Sequencing Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6794051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Ripple-Spreading Genetic Algorithm for the Aircraft Sequencing Problem","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ripple-Spreading Genetic Algorithm for the Aircraft Sequencing Problem","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045084S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"6793177","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6794051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6794113,"authors":[{"name":"Milan Mijajlovic","affiliation":["Exobiology Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail-Stop 239-4, Moffett Field, California 94035, USA."],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Mijajlovic"},{"name":"Mark J.

Participants searched for visual targets defined by a unique feature (Experiment 1) or feature conjunction (Experiment 2), and simultaneously listened to narrated text passages that had to be recalled later (encoding condition), or heard backward-played speech sounds that could be ignored (control condition). Responses to targets were slower in the encoding condition, and ERPs revealed that the visual processing of search arrays and the attentional selection of target stimuli were less efficient in the encoding relative to the control condition. Results demonstrate that the attentional processing of visual information is impaired when concurrent spoken messages are encoded and maintained, in line with cross-modal links in selective attention, but inconsistent with the view that attentional resources are modality-specific. The distraction of visual attention by active listening could contribute to the adverse effects of cell phone use on driving performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6794179","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720218/6794179/06794312.pdf","doi":"10.1162/jocn.2010.21468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2010.21468","startPage":"832","endPage":"844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Listening Impairs Visual Perception and Selectivity: An ERP Study of Auditory Dual-task Costs on Visual Attention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6794312/","displayDocTitle":"Active Listening Impairs Visual Perception and Selectivity: An ERP Study of Auditory Dual-task Costs on Visual Attention","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Listening Impairs Visual Perception and Selectivity: An ERP Study of Auditory Dual-task Costs on Visual Attention","sourcePdf":"jocn201021468.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050216S","chronDate":"April  2011","isNumber":"6794179","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","articleId":"6794312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6794751,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer S.

Various theories of the social functions of the orbitofrontal cortex focus on the role of this area in either emotional processing or its involvement in online monitoring of behavior (i.e., self-monitoring). The present research attempts to integrate these two theories by examining whether improving the self-monitoring of patients with orbitofrontal damage is associated with the generation of emotions needed to guide interpersonal behavior. Patients with orbitofrontal damage, patients with lateral prefrontal damage, and healthy controls took part in an interpersonal task. After completing the task, participants' self-monitoring was increased by showing them a videotape of their task performance. In comparison to healthy controls and patients with lateral prefrontal damage, orbitofrontal damage was associated with objectively inappropriate social behavior. Although patients with orbitofrontal damage were aware of social norms of intimacy, they were unaware that their task performance violated these norms. The embarrassment typically associated with inappropriate social behavior was elicited in these patients only after their self-monitoring increased from viewing their videotaped performance. These findings suggest that damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs self-insight that may preclude the generation of helpful emotional information. The results highlight the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in the interplay of self-monitoring and emotional processing and suggest avenues for neurorehabilitation of patients with social deficits subsequent to orbitofrontal damage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6794751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"18","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Orbitofrontal Cortex and Social Behavior: Integrating Self-monitoring and Emotion-Cognition Interactions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orbitofrontal Cortex and Social Behavior: Integrating Self-monitoring and Emotion-Cognition Interactions","sourcePdf":"jocn2006186871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048802S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"6794148","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6794751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6795099,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshiyuki Kashiwase","affiliation":["1Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiyuki","lastName":"Kashiwase"},{"name":"Kazumichi Matsumiya","affiliation":["1Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazumichi","lastName":"Matsumiya"},{"name":"Ichiro Kuriki","affiliation":["1Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichiro","lastName":"Kuriki"},{"name":"Satoshi Shioiri","affiliation":["1Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Shioiri"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0898-929X"}],"articleNumber":"6795099","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795099","doi":"10.1162/jocn_a_00212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6794214","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720218/6794214/06795099.pdf","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Courses of Attentional Modulation in Neural Amplification and Synchronization Measured with Steady-state Visual-evoked Potentials","abstract":"Endogenous attention modulates the amplitude and phase coherence of steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs).

We presented two stimuli flickering at different frequencies in the left and right visual hemifields and asked observers to shift their attention to either stimulus. Our results demonstrated that attention increased SSVEP phase coherence earlier than it increased SSVEP amplitude, with a positive correlation between the attentional modulations of SSVEP phase coherence and amplitude. Furthermore, the behavioral dynamics of attention shifts were more closely associated with changes in phase coherence than with changes in amplitude. These results are consistent with the possibility that attention increases neural response synchronization, which in turn leads to increased neural population activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","volume":"24","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time Courses of Attentional Modulation in Neural Amplification and Synchronization Measured with Steady-state Visual-evoked Potentials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Courses of Attentional Modulation in Neural Amplification and Synchronization Measured with Steady-state Visual-evoked Potentials","sourcePdf":"jocn_a_00212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019261S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"6794214","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6795099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795228,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald J.

The \u03b2-divergence is a family of cost functions parameterized by a single shape parameter \u03b2 that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (\u03b2 = 2, 1, 0 respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a \u03b2-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can, however, be proven for \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of the majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm, which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The letter also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF: penalized NMF (when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"23","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the \u03b2-Divergence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the \u03b2-Divergence","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025299S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6795237","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"152","articleId":"6795238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6795251,"authors":[{"name":"Mattias Ohlsson","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Lund, S\u00f6lvegatan 14A, S-22362 Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mattias","lastName":"Ohlsson"},{"name":"Carsten Peterson","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Lund, S\u00f6lvegatan 14A, S-22362 Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Peterson"},{"name":"Bo S\u00f6derberg","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Lund, S\u00f6lvegatan 14A, S-22362 Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"S\u00f6derberg"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795251","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795251","abstract":"A strategy for finding approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems with inequality constraints using mean field neural networks is presented.

He suggested that the neocortex learns by self-organization to extract the structure from the patterns of activity incident upon it. He proposed a feedforward neural network in which the connections to the output cells (identified with the pyramidal cells of the neocortex) are modified by a mechanism of competitive learning. It was intended that each output cell comes to be selective for the input patterns from a different class and is able to respond to new patterns from the same class that have not been seen before. The learning rule that Marr proposed was underspecified, but a logical extension of the basic idea results in a synaptic learning rule in which the total amount of synaptic strength of the connections from each input (\u201cpresynaptic\u201d) cell is kept at a constant level. In contrast, conventional competitive learning involves rules of the \u201cpostsynaptic\u201d type. The network learns by exploiting the structure that Marr assumed to exist within the ensemble of input patterns. For this case, analysis is possible that extends that carried out by Marr, which was restricted to the binary classification task. This analysis is presented here, together with results from computer simulations of different types of competitive learning mechanisms. The presynaptic mechanism is best known in the computational neuroscience literature. In neural network applications, it may be a more suitable mechanism of competitive learning than those normally considered.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.4.911","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795303/06795304.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"936","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.4.911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Marr's Theory of the Neocortex as a Self-Organizing Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 15 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 15 1997","displayDocTitle":"Marr's Theory of the Neocortex as a Self-Organizing Neural Network","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"15 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Marr's Theory of the Neocortex as a Self-Organizing Neural Network","sourcePdf":"neco199794911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021244S","chronDate":"May 15 1997","isNumber":"6795303","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6795304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795309,"authors":[{"name":"William G.

Using this approximation we indicate the reasons why simple backpropagation is less likely to get stuck in local minima than the batch training process and demonstrate this empirically on a number of examples.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1994.6.2.285","startPage":"285","endPage":"295","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795342/06795343.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1994.6.2.285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion Approximations for the Constant Learning Rate Backpropagation Algorithm and Resistance to Local Minima","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion Approximations for the Constant Learning Rate Backpropagation Algorithm and Resistance to Local Minima","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion Approximations for the Constant Learning Rate Backpropagation Algorithm and Resistance to Local Minima","sourcePdf":"neco199462285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01869S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6795342","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6795343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795347,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Y.

The restrictions that we impose on the signals to be classified are that they satisfy an assumption of nondegeneracy and that noise amplitude is sufficiently small. Further, we demonstrate that the recurrent neural networks may not only classify uncertain signals adaptively but also can recover the values of uncertain parameters of the signals, up to their equivalence classes.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.05-07-527","startPage":"2564","endPage":"2596","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.05-07-527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795346","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795346/06795347.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Classification of Temporal Signals in Fixed-Weight Recurrent Neural Networks: An Existence Proof","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795347/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Classification of Temporal Signals in Fixed-Weight Recurrent Neural Networks: An Existence Proof","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Classification of Temporal Signals in Fixed-Weight Recurrent Neural Networks: An Existence Proof","sourcePdf":"neco200805-07-527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037917S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"6795346","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6795347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795348,"authors":[{"name":"Dequan Jin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China dqjin@yahoo.cn"],"firstName":"Dequan","lastName":"Jin"},{"name":"Jigen Peng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China jgpeng@mail.xjtu.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Jigen","lastName":"Peng"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795348","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795348","doi":"10.1162/neco.2009.11-07-637","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795244/06795348.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"101","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2009.11-07-637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach for Estimating the Attraction Domain for Hopfield-Type Neural Networks","abstract":"In this letter, using methods proposed by E.

This is affected by ascribing each synapse a finite number of stable states in which it can maintain for indefinitely long periods. Learning uncorrelated stimuli is expressed as a stochastic process produced by the neural activities on the synapses. In several interesting cases the stochastic process can be analyzed in detail, leading to a clarification of the performance of the network, as an associative memory, during the process of uninterrupted learning. The stochastic nature of the process and the existence of an asymptotic distribution for the synaptic values in the network imply generically that the memory is a palimpsest but capacity is as low as log \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n for a network of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n neurons. The only way we find for avoiding this tight constraint is to allow the parameters governing the learning process (the coding level of the stimuli; the transition probabilities for potentiation and depression and the number of stable synaptic levels) to depend on the number of neurons. It is shown that a network with synapses that have two stable states can dynamically learn with optimal storage efficiency, be a palimpsest, and maintain its (associative) memory for an indefinitely long time provided the coding level is low and depression is equilibrated against potentiation. We suggest that an option so easily implementable in material devices would not have been overlooked by biology. Finally we discuss the stochastic learning on synapses with variable number of stable synaptic states.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1994.6.5.957","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795351/06795385.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1994.6.5.957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in Neural Networks with Material Synapses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795385/","displayDocTitle":"Learning in Neural Networks with Material Synapses","volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in Neural Networks with Material Synapses","sourcePdf":"neco199465957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062653S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"6795351","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6795385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795415,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Kanamaru","affiliation":["Department of Innovative Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Global Engineering, Kogakuin University, Hachioji-city, Tokyo 193-0802, Japan. kanamaru@cc.kogakuin.ac.jp"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kanamaru"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8505, Japan, and ERATO, JST, Tokyo 153-8505, Japan. aihara@sat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Aihara"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795415","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795415","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.05-07-516","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795414/06795415.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.05-07-516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Synchrony of Chaos in a Pulse-Coupled Neural Network with Both Chemical and Electrical Synapses Among Inhibitory Neurons","abstract":"The synchronous firing of neurons in a pulse-coupled neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is analyzed.

A natural way to answer this question is to make an assumption about the type of neuron, select an appropriate model for this type, and then choose the model parameters as those that are most likely to generate the observed spike train. This is the maximum likelihood method. If the neuron obeys simple integrate-and-fire dynamics, Paninski, Pillow, and Simoncelli (\n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2004</xref>\n) showed that its negative log-likelihood function is convex and that, at least in principle, its unique global minimum can thus be found by gradient descent techniques. Many biological neurons are, however, known to generate a richer repertoire of spiking behaviors than can be explained in a simple integrate-and-fire model. For instance, such a model retains only an implicit (through spike-induced currents), not an explicit, memory of its input; an example of a physiological situation that cannot be explained is the absence of firing if the input current is increased very slowly. Therefore, we use an expanded model (Mihalas & Niebur, \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2009</xref>\n), which is capable of generating a large number of complex firing patterns while still being linear. Linearity is important because it maintains the distribution of the random variables and still allows maximum likelihood methods to be used. In this study, we show that although convexity of the negative log-likelihood function is not guaranteed for this model, the minimum of this function yields a good estimate for the model parameters, in particular if the noise level is treated as a free parameter. Furthermore, we show that a nonlinear function minimization method (r-algorithm with space dilation) usually reaches the global minimum.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795438","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795370/06795438.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00196","startPage":"2833","endPage":"2867","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Parameters of Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons from the Maximum Likelihood of Spike Trains","volume":"23","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Parameters of Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons from the Maximum Likelihood of Spike Trains","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028672S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6795370","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6795438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795442,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchun Lee","affiliation":["Digital Equipment Corp., 40 Old Bolton Road OG01-2/U11, Stow, MA 01775 USA"],"firstName":"Yuchun","lastName":"Lee"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795442","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795442","abstract":"Results of recent research suggest that carefully designed multiplayer neural networks with local \u201creceptive fields\u201d and shared weights may be unique in providing low error rates on handwritten digit recognition tasks.

The backpropagation network is overall superior in memory usage and classification time but can provide \u201cfalse positive\u201d classifications when the input is not a digit. The backpropagation network also has the longest training time. The RBF classifier requires more memory and more classification time, but less training time. When high accuracy is warranted, the RBF classifier can generate a more effective confidence judgment for rejecting ambiguous inputs. The simple kNN classifier can also perform handwritten digit recognition, but requires a prohibitively large amount of memory and is much slower at classification. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the algorithm and fast training characteristics makes the kNN classifier an attractive candidate in hardware-assisted classification tasks. These results on a large, high input dimensional problem demonstrate that practical constraints including training time, memory usage, and classification time often constrain classifier selection more strongly than small differences in overall error rate.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1991.3.3.440","startPage":"440","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795441/06795442.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1991.3.3.440","endPage":"449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten Digit Recognition Using <i>K</i> Nearest-Neighbor, Radial-Basis Function, and Backpropagation Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Handwritten Digit Recognition Using <i>K</i> Nearest-Neighbor, Radial-Basis Function, and Backpropagation Neural Networks","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handwritten Digit Recognition Using <italic>K</italic> Nearest-Neighbor, Radial-Basis Function, and Backpropagation Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"neco199133440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016821S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"6795441","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"38","articleId":"6795442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795446,"authors":[{"name":"Peter M.

In this work, aside from questions of estimator performance, we demonstrate that theoretical spike-field coherence for a broad class of spiking models depends on the expected rate of spiking. This rate dependence confounds the phase locking of spike events to field-potential oscillations with overall neuron activity and is demonstrated analytically, for a large class of stochastic models, and in simulation. Finally, the relationship between the spike-field coherence and the intensity field coherence is detailed analytically. This latter quantity is independent of neuron firing rate and, under commonly found conditions, is proportional to the probability that a neuron spikes at a specific phase of field oscillation. Hence, intensity field coherence is a rate-independent measure and a candidate on which to base the appropriate statistical inference of spike field synchrony.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00169","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795237/06795461.pdf","startPage":"2209","endPage":"2241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Dependence of Spike Field Coherence on Expected Intensity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Dependence of Spike Field Coherence on Expected Intensity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795461/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dependence of Spike Field Coherence on Expected Intensity","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034651S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6795237","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6795461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795471,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hou Zheng","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, China, and School of Information and Technology, Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, Shandong, 276826, China zhengch@iim.ac.cn"],"firstName":"Chun-Hou","lastName":"Zheng"},{"name":"De-Shuang Huang","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, China dshuang@iim.ac.cn"],"firstName":"De-Shuang","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Kang Li","affiliation":["k.li@ee.qub.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"George Irwin","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, U.K. g.irwin@ee.qub.ac.uk"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Irwin"},{"name":"Zhan-Li Sun","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, China sun_zhl@iim.ac.cn"],"firstName":"Zhan-Li","lastName":"Sun"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795471","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"In this letter, a standard postnonlinear blind source separation algorithm is proposed, based on the MISEP method, which is widely used in linear and nonlinear independent component analysis.

In particular, a group of three-layered perceptrons and a linear network are used as the unmixing system to separate sources in the postnonlinear mixtures, and another group of three-layered perceptron is used as the auxiliary network. The learning algorithm for the unmixing system is then obtained by maximizing the output entropy of the auxiliary network.

Although the electronic engineering aspects of these emulation systems is proceeding well, progress toward the actual emulation of brainlike tasks is restricted by the lack of suitable high-level configuration methods of the kind that have already been developed over many decades for simulations on general-purpose computers. The key difficulty is that the dynamics of the CMOS electronic analogs are determined by transistor biases that do not map simply to the parameter types and values used in typical abstract mathematical models of neurons and their networks. Here we provide a general method for resolving this difficulty. We describe a parameter mapping technique that permits an automatic configuration of VLSI neural networks so that their electronic emulation conforms to a higher-level neuronal simulation. We show that the neurons configured by our method exhibit spike timing statistics and temporal dynamics that are the same as those observed in the software simulated neurons and, in particular, that the key parameters of recurrent VLSI neural networks (e.g., implementing soft winner-take-all) can be precisely tuned. The proposed method permits a seamless integration between software simulations with hardware emulations and intertranslatability between the parameters of abstract neuronal models and their emulation counterparts. Most important, our method offers a route toward a high-level task configuration language for neuromorphic VLSI systems.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00182","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795484/06795485.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00182","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"2457","endPage":"2497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Method for Configuring VLSI Networks of Spiking Neurons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Method for Configuring VLSI Networks of Spiking Neurons","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795485/","volume":"23","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Method for Configuring VLSI Networks of Spiking Neurons","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022644S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6795484","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6795485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795506,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Ti\u0148o","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, U.K., P.Tino@bham.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Ti\u0148o"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795506","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795506","doi":"10.1162/neco.2007.19.4.1056","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795254/06795506.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.19.4.1056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equilibria of Iterative Softmax and Critical Temperatures for Intermittent Search in Self-Organizing Neural Networks","abstract":"Kwok and Smith (2005) recently proposed a new kind of optimization dynamics using self-organizing neural networks (SONN) driven by softmax weight renormalization.

This study investigates the tracking dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). Due to the translational invariance of neuronal recurrent interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of stationary states. They form a continuous manifold in which the neural system is neutrally stable. We systematically explore how this property facilitates the tracking performance of a CANN, which is believed to have clear correspondence with brain functions. By using the wave functions of the quantum harmonic oscillator as the basis, we demonstrate how the dynamics of a CANN is decomposed into different motion modes, corresponding to distortions in the amplitude, position, width, or skewness of the network state. We then develop a perturbation approach that utilizes the dominating movement of the network's stationary states in the state space. This method allows us to approximate the network dynamics up to an arbitrary accuracy depending on the order of perturbation used. We quantify the distortions of a gaussian bump during tracking and study their effects on tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable and the reaction time for the network to catch up with an abrupt change in the stimulus.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2009.07-08-824","startPage":"752","endPage":"792","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795328/06795513.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2009.07-08-824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Moving Bump in a Continuous Manifold: A Comprehensive Study of the Tracking Dynamics of Continuous Attractor Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Moving Bump in a Continuous Manifold: A Comprehensive Study of the Tracking Dynamics of Continuous Attractor Neural Networks","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Moving Bump in a Continuous Manifold: A Comprehensive Study of the Tracking Dynamics of Continuous Attractor Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"neco200907-08-824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026412S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"6795328","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6795513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795529,"authors":[{"name":"David H.

Another correction is appropriate for measuring full generalization error over a test set rather than (as with conventional bias plus variance) error at a single point. Yet another correction can help explain the recent counterintuitive bias-variance decomposition of Friedman for zero-one loss. After presenting these corrections, this article discusses some other loss function-specific aspects of supervised learning.

Yet common intuitions are inadequate to explain basic properties of LIF responses to sinusoidal modulations of the input. Here we examine responses to low - and moderate-frequency modulations of both the mean and variance of the input current and quantify how these responses depend on baseline parameters. Across parameters, responses to modulations in the mean current are low pass, approaching zero in the limit of high frequencies. For very low baseline firing rates, the response cutoff frequency matches that expected from membrane integration. However, the cutoff shows a rapid, supralinear increase with firing rate, with a steeper increase in the case of lower noise. For modulations of the input variance, the gain at high frequency remains finite. Here, we show that the low-frequency responses depend strongly on baseline parameters and derive an analytic condition specifying the parameters at which responses switch from being dominated by low versus high frequencies. Additionally, we show that the resonant responses for variance modulations have properties not expected for common oscillatory resonances: they peak at frequencies higher than the baseline firing rate and persist when oscillatory spiking is disrupted by high noise. Finally, the responses to mean and variance modulations are shown to have a complementary dependence on baseline parameters at higher frequencies, resulting in responses to modulations of Poisson input rates that are independent of baseline input statistics.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00114","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795549/06795550.pdf","startPage":"1234","endPage":"1247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795550/","displayDocTitle":"The Dynamics of Integrate-and-Fire: Mean Versus Variance Modulations and Dependence on Baseline Parameters","volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dynamics of Integrate-and-Fire: Mean Versus Variance Modulations and Dependence on Baseline Parameters","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030358S","chronDate":"May  2011","isNumber":"6795549","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6795550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795552,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa C.

This article presents a functional space approximation framework to better understand the operation of ESNs and proposes an information-theoretic metric, the average entropy of echo states, to assess the richness of the ESN dynamics. Furthermore, it provides an interpretation of the ESN dynamics rooted in system theory as families of coupled linearized systems whose poles move according to the input signal dynamics. With this interpretation, a design methodology for functional approximation is put forward where ESNs are designed with uniform pole distributions covering the frequency spectrum to abide by the richness metric, irrespective of the spectral radius. A single bias parameter at the ESN input, adapted with the modeling error, configures the ESN spectral radius to the input-output joint space. Function approximation examples compare the proposed design methodology versus the conventional design.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795552","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795295/06795552.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.19.1.111","doi":"10.1162/neco.2007.19.1.111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Echo State Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795552/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Echo State Networks","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Echo State Networks","sourcePdf":"neco2007191111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021884S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"6795295","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"63","articleId":"6795552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795555,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Miller","affiliation":["pmiller@brandeis.edu"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Miller"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795555","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795555","doi":"10.1162/neco.2006.18.6.1268","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795432/06795555.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.6.1268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Spike Statistics in Neuronal Systems with Continuous Attractors or Multiple, Discrete Attractor States","abstract":"Attractor networks are likely to underlie working memory and integrator circuits in the brain. It is unknown whether continuous quantities are stored in an analog manner or discretized and stored in a set of discrete attractors. In order to investigate the important issue of how to differentiate the two systems, here we compare the neuronal spiking activity that arises from a continuous (line) attractor with that from a series of discrete attractors. Stochastic fluctuations cause the position of the system along its continuous attractor to vary as a random walk, whereas in a discrete attractor, noise causes spontaneous transitions to occur between discrete states at random intervals. We calculate the statistics of spike trains of neurons firing as a Poisson process with rates that vary according to the underlying attractor network. Since individual neurons fire spikes probabilistically and since the state of the network as a whole drifts randomly, the spike trains of individual neurons follow a doubly stochastic (Poisson) point process. We compare the series of spike trains from the two systems using the autocorrelation function, Fano factor, and interspike interval (ISI) distribution. Although the variation in rate can be dramatically different, especially for short time intervals, surprisingly both the autocorrelation functions and Fano factors are identical, given appropriate scaling of the noise terms. Since the range of firing rates is limited in neurons, we also investigate systems for which the variation in rate is bounded by either rigid limits or because of leak to a single attractor state, such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In these cases, the time dependence of the variance in rate can be different between discrete and continuous systems, so that in principle, these processes can be distinguished using second-order spike statistics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Spike Statistics in Neuronal Systems with Continuous Attractors or Multiple, Discrete Attractor States","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Spike Statistics in Neuronal Systems with Continuous Attractors or Multiple, Discrete Attractor States","sourcePdf":"neco20061861268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017512S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"6795432","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6795555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795557,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0404, U.S.A. yoc002@cs.ucsd.edu"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Cho"},{"name":"Lawrence K.

We found that if a neural network is designed in the chaos phase, the eigenvalue spectrum of its synaptic matrix behaves like that of a random matrix (i.e., all eigenvalues lie uniformly distributed within a circle in the complex plan), and if it is designed in the memory phase, the eigenvalue spectrum will split into two parts: one part corresponds to a random background, the other part equal in number to the memory attractors.

A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs, namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795231","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795231/06795634.pdf","doi":"10.1162/neco.1990.2.3.308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1990.2.3.308","startPage":"308","endPage":"320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Theory of Early Visual Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795634/","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Theory of Early Visual Processing","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a Theory of Early Visual Processing","sourcePdf":"neco199023308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075231S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"6795231","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"29","articleId":"6795634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795640,"authors":[{"name":"Michiel D'Haene","affiliation":["Ghent University, Electronics and Information Systems Department, 9000 Ghent, Belgium michiel.dhaene@ugent.be"],"firstName":"Michiel","lastName":"D'Haene"},{"name":"Benjamin Schrauwen","affiliation":["Ghent University, Electronics and Information Systems Department, 9000 Ghent, Belgium benjamin.schrauwen@ugent.be"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Schrauwen"},{"name":"Jan Van Campenhout","affiliation":["Ghent University, Electronics and Information Systems Department, 9000 Ghent, Belgium jan.vancampenhout@elis.ugent.be"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Van Campenhout"},{"name":"Dirk Stroobandt","affiliation":["Ghent University, Electronics and Information Systems Department, 9000 Ghent, Belgium dirk.stroobandt@ugent.be"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Stroobandt"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795640","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Event-Driven Simulation of Spiking Neurons with Multiple Synaptic Time Constants","abstract":"The simulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) is known to be a very time-consuming task. This limits the size of SNN that can be simulated in reasonable time or forces users to overly limit the complexity of the neuron models. This is one of the driving forces behind much of the recent research on event-driven simulation strategies. Although event-driven simulation allows precise and efficient simulation of certain spiking neuron models, it is not straightforward to generalize the technique to more complex neuron models, mostly because the firing time of these neuron models is computationally expensive to evaluate. Most solutions proposed in literature concentrate on algorithms that can solve this problem efficiently. However, these solutions do not scale well when more state variables are involved in the neuron model, which is, for example, the case when multiple synaptic time constants for each neuron are used. In this letter, we show that an exact prediction of the firing time is not required in order to guarantee exact simulation results. Several techniques are presented that try to do the least possible amount of work to predict the firing times. We propose an elegant algorithm for the simulation of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with an arbitrary number of (unconstrained) synaptic time constants, which is able to combine these algorithmic techniques efficiently, resulting in very high simulation speed. Moreover, our algorithm is highly independent of the complexity (i.e., number of synaptic time constants) of the underlying neuron model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.02-08-707","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.02-08-707","startPage":"1068","endPage":"1099","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795340/06795640.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795640/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Event-Driven Simulation of Spiking Neurons with Multiple Synaptic Time Constants","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Event-Driven Simulation of Spiking Neurons with Multiple Synaptic Time Constants","sourcePdf":"neco200802-08-707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036098S","chronDate":"April  2009","isNumber":"6795340","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6795640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795645,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In particular, networks using second-order units have been successful at this task. In studying the performance and learning behavior of such networks we have found that the second-order network model attempts to form clusters in activation space as its internal representation of states. However, these learned states become unstable as longer and longer test input strings are presented to the network. In essence, the network \u201cforgets\u201d where the individual states are in activation space. In this paper we propose a new method to force such a network to learn stable states by introducing discretization into the network and using a pseudo-gradient learning rule to perform training. The essence of the learning rule is that in doing gradient descent, it makes use of the gradient of a sigmoid function as a heuristic hint in place of that of the hard-limiting function, while still using the discretized value in the feedback update path. The new structure uses isolated points in activation space instead of vague clusters as its internal representation of states. It is shown to have similar capabilities in learning finite state automata as the original network, but without the instability problem. The proposed pseudo-gradient learning rule may also be used as a basis for training other types of networks that have hard-limiting threshold activation functions.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1993.5.6.976","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795386/06795690.pdf","startPage":"976","endPage":"990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1993.5.6.976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Finite State Machines With Self-Clustering Recurrent Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795690/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Finite State Machines With Self-Clustering Recurrent Networks","volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Finite State Machines With Self-Clustering Recurrent Networks","sourcePdf":"neco199356976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029032S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6795386","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"28","articleId":"6795690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795703,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph J.

Since the measure of pixel-entropy has only a global minimum the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the minimum entropy map. Such optimal maps have recently been shown to possess cognitively desirable properties and are likely to be used by the nervous system to organize sensory information. The algorithm derived here turns out to be one proposed by Goodall for pairwise decorrelation. It is biologically plausible since in a neural network implementation it requires only data available locally to a neuron. In training over ensembles of two-dimensional input signals with the same spatial power spectrum as natural scenes, networks develop output neurons with center-surround receptive fields similar to those of ganglion cells in the retina.

The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor, which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter \"abstract concepts\" out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those on which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle that aim at finding binary factorial codes (Barlow \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al</i>\n. 1989), i.e., codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, and (3) novelty detection. Methods for finding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for finding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also nonlinear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The final part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"4","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning Factorial Codes by Predictability Minimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Factorial Codes by Predictability Minimization","sourcePdf":"neco199246863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019059S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"6795547","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"25","articleId":"6795705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795724,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

These signals can arrive either from other neurons or from the outside world: they are summed at the input of each neuron and constitute its signal potential. The state of each neuron in this model is its signal potential, while the network state is the vector of signal potentials at each neuron. If its potential is positive, a neuron fires, and sends out signals to the other neurons of the network or to the outside world. As it does so its signal potential is depleted. We have shown (Gelenbe 1989) that in the Markovian case, this model has product form, that is, the steady-state probability distribution of its potential vector is the product of the marginal probabilities of the potential at each neuron. The signal flow equations of the network, which describe the rate at which positive or negative signals arrive at each neuron, are nonlinear, so that their existence and uniqueness are not easily established except for the case of feedforward (or backpropagation) networks (Gelenbe 1989). In this paper we show that whenever the solution to these signal flow equations exists, it is unique. We then examine two subclasses of networks \u2014 balanced and damped networks \u2014 and obtain stability conditions in each case. In practical terms, these stability conditions guarantee that the unique solution can be found to the signal flow equations and therefore that the network has a well-defined steady-state behavior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of the Random Neural Network Model","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/neco.1990.2.2.239","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795676/06795731.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1990.2.2.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795731/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","displayDocTitle":"Stability of the Random Neural Network Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of the Random Neural Network Model","sourcePdf":"neco199022239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0331S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"6795676","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"60","articleId":"6795731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795734,"authors":[{"name":"Gary M.

This method is applied to the task of modeling a nonisothermal chemical reactor in which a first-order exothermic reaction is occurring. This method produces statistically significant gains in accuracy over both a standard neural network approach and a linear model. Furthermore, using the approximate linear model to initialize the weights of the network produces statistically less variation in model fidelity. By structuring the neural network according to the approximate linear model, the model can be readily interpreted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Process Models Based on Linear Model Structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Process Models Based on Linear Model Structures","sourcePdf":"neco199464718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039824S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"6795349","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6795734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795742,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Neural selection mechanisms employed by the competitive neural network receiving external input sare studied with analytic and numerical calculations. A remarkable finding is that the strength of lateral inhibition relative to that of self-inhibition is crucial for determining the steady states of the network among three qualitatively different types of behavior. Equal strength of both types of inhibitory connections leads the network to the well-known winner-take-all behavior. If, however, the lateral inhibition is weaker than the self-inhibition, a certain number of neurons are activated in the steady states or the number of winners is in general more than one (the winners-share-all behavior). On the other hand, if the self-inhibition is weaker than the lateral one, only one neuron is activated, but the winner is not necessarily the neuron receiving the largest input. It is suggested that our simple network model provides a mathematical basis for understanding neural selection mechanisms.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.77","startPage":"77","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795420","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795420/06795749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Neural Network Exhibiting Selective Activation of Neuronal Ensembles: From Winner-Take-All to Winners-Share-All","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795749/","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Neural Network Exhibiting Selective Activation of Neuronal Ensembles: From Winner-Take-All to Winners-Share-All","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan. 1 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Neural Network Exhibiting Selective Activation of Neuronal Ensembles: From Winner-Take-All to Winners-Share-All","sourcePdf":"neco19979177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021295S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 1997","isNumber":"6795420","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"27","articleId":"6795749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795764,"authors":[{"name":"Simon A.

Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">partial ordering</i>\n corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">semi-invariance</i>\n, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">stability</i>\n, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions.

In the neural network scheme it means minimizing the number of input and hidden units. Three time series modeling experiments are used to examine the usefulness of the PMDL model selection scheme. A comparison with the widely used cross-validation technique is also presented. In our experiments the PMDL scheme and the cross-validation scheme yield similar results in terms of model complexity.

Its advantage over the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, often used for realizing the ML estimation, has been experimentally shown in many applications; nevertheless, it has not yet been theoretically shown. In this letter, through analysis of the simplest unidentifiable models, we theoretically show some properties of the VB approach. We first prove that in three-layer linear neural networks, the VB approach is asymptotically equivalent to a positive-part James-Stein type shrinkage estimation. Then we theoretically clarify its free energy, generalization error, and training error. Comparing them with those of the ML estimation and the Bayes estimation, we discuss the advantage of the VB approach. We also show that unlike in the Bayes estimation, the free energy and the generalization error are less simply related with each other and that in typical cases, the VB free energy well approximates the Bayes one, while the VB generalization error significantly differs from the Bayes one.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2007.19.4.1112","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1153","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795254/06795814.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.19.4.1112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Bayes Solution of Linear Neural Networks and Its Generalization Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Variational Bayes Solution of Linear Neural Networks and Its Generalization Performance","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Bayes Solution of Linear Neural Networks and Its Generalization Performance","sourcePdf":"neco20071941112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027725S","chronDate":"April  2007","isNumber":"6795254","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6795814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795828,"authors":[{"name":"Wolfgang Konen","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Neuroinfomatik, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Konen"},{"name":"Christoph von der Malsburg","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Neuroinfomatik, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph von der","lastName":"Malsburg"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795828","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795828","abstract":"A large attraction of neural systems lies in their promise of replacing programming by learning. A problem with many current neural models is that with realistically large input patterns learning time explodes. This is a problem inherent in a notion of learning that is based almost entirely on statistical estimation. We propose here a different learning style where significant relations in the input pattern are recognized and expressed by the unsupervised self-organization of dynamic links. The power of this mechanism is due to the very general a priori principle of conservation of topological structure. We demonstrate that style with a system that learns to classify mirror symmetric pixel patterns from single examples.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1993.5.5.719","startPage":"719","endPage":"735","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795518/06795828.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1993.5.5.719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Generalize from Single Examples in the Dynamic Link Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Generalize from Single Examples in the Dynamic Link Architecture","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Generalize from Single Examples in the Dynamic Link Architecture","sourcePdf":"neco199355719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267409S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6795518","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6795828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795829,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Roberts","affiliation":["Neural Network Research Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Roberts"},{"name":"Lionel Tarassenko","affiliation":["Neural Network Research Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Tarassenko"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795829","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795829","abstract":"The detection of novel or abnormal input vectors is of importance in many monitoring tasks, such as fault detection in complex systems and detection of abnormal patterns in medical diagnostics.

The concept of multiway data refers to arrays of data with more than two dimensions, that is, taking the form of tensors. To analyze such data, decomposition techniques are widely used. The two most common decompositions for tensors are the Tucker model and the more restricted PARAFAC model. Both models can be viewed as generalizations of the regular factor analysis to data of more than two modalities. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), in conjunction with sparse coding, has recently been given much attention due to its part-based and easy interpretable representation. While NMF has been extended to the PARAFAC model, no such attempt has been done to extend NMF to the Tucker model. However, if the tensor data analyzed are nonnegative, it may well be relevant to consider purely additive (i.e., nonnegative) Tucker decompositions). To reduce ambiguities of this type of decomposition, we develop updates that can impose sparseness in any combination of modalities, hence, proposed algorithms for sparse nonnegative Tucker decompositions (SN-TUCKER). We demonstrate how the proposed algorithms are superior to existing algorithms for Tucker decompositions when the data and interactions can be considered nonnegative. We further illustrate how sparse coding can help identify what model (PARAFAC or Tucker) is more appropriate for the data as well as to select the number of components by turning off excess components. The algorithms for SN-TUCKER can be downloaded from M\u00f8rup (2007).","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.11-06-407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.11-06-407","endPage":"2131","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795414/06795838.pdf","startPage":"2112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for Sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795838/","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for Sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions","volume":"20","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for Sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions","sourcePdf":"neco200811-06-407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02512S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"6795414","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"35","articleId":"6795838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795839,"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell B.

It is shown that, on average, integrate-and-fire neurons adapt to the root-mean-square noise level of their input. This phenomenon is referred to as noise adaptation. Noise adaptation is characterized by a decrease in the average neural firing rate and an accompanying decrease in the average value of the generator potential, both of which can be attributed to noise-induced resets of the generator potential mediated by the integrate-and-fire mechanism. A quantitative theory of noise adaptation in stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons is developed. It is shown that integrate-and-fire neurons, on average, produce transient spiking activity whenever there is an increase in the level of their input noise. This transient noise response is either reduced or eliminated over time, depending on the parameters of the model neuron. Analytical methods are used to prove that nonleaky integrate-and-fire neurons totally adapt to any constant input noise level, in the sense that their asymptotic spiking rates are independent of the magnitude of their input noise. For leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, the long-run noise adaptation is not total, but the response to noise is partially eliminated. Expressions for the probability density function of the generator potential and the first two moments of the potential distribution are derived for the particular case of a nonleaky neuron driven by gaussian white noise of mean zero and constant variance. The functional significance of noise adaptation for the performance of networks comprising integrate-and-fire neurons is discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Adaptation in Integrate-and-Fire Neurons","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.5.1047","endPage":"1069","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795235/06795841.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"1047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.5.1047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Noise Adaptation in Integrate-and-Fire Neurons","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795841/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 1997","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Adaptation in Integrate-and-Fire Neurons","sourcePdf":"neco1997951047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016831S","chronDate":"July 1 1997","isNumber":"6795235","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6795841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795848,"authors":[{"name":"James R.

Finally, the fast and noise-robust implementation of sigmoidal neural nets by temporal coding points to possible new ways of implementing feedforward and recurrent sigmoidal neural nets with pulse stream VLSI.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.2.279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.2.279","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795497/06795871.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Sigmoidal Networks via Spiking Neurons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb. 15 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast Sigmoidal Networks via Spiking Neurons","volume":"9","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 15 1997","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795871/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Sigmoidal Networks via Spiking Neurons","sourcePdf":"neco199792279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018714S","chronDate":"Feb. 15 1997","isNumber":"6795497","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"47","articleId":"6795871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6795872,"authors":[{"name":"Hyuek-Jae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, P.O.

We begin with the problem of inducing deterministic finite state automata from finite training sets, that include both positive and negative examples, an NP-hard problem (Angluin and Smith 1983). We use a neural network architecture with two recurrent layers, which we argue can approximate any discrete-time, time-invariant dynamic system, with computation of the full gradient during learning. The networks are trained to classify strings as belonging or not belonging to the grammar. The training sets used contain only short strings, and the sets are constructed in a way that does not require a priori knowledge of the grammar. After training, the networks are tested using various test sets with strings of length up to 1000, and are often able to correctly classify all the test strings. These results are comparable to those obtained with second-order networks (Giles \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al</i>\n. 1992; Watrous and Kuhn 1992a; Zeng \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al</i>\n. 1993). We observe that the networks emulate finite state automata, confirming the results of other authors, and we use a vector quantization algorithm to extract deterministic finite state automata after training and during testing of the networks, obtaining a table listing the start state, accept states, reject states, all transitions from the states, as well as some useful statistics. We examine the correspondence between finite state automata and neural networks in detail, showing two major stages in the learning process. To this end, we use a graphics module, which graphically depicts the states of the network during the learning and testing phases. We examine the networks' performance when tested on strings much longer than those in the training set, noting a measure based on clustering that is correlated to the stability of the networks. Finally, we observe that with sufficiently long training times, neural networks can become true finite state automata, due to the attractor structure of their dynamics.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1994.6.6.1155","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1173","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1994.6.6.1155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795388","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795388/06795895.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First-Order Recurrent Neural Networks and Deterministic Finite State Automata","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795895/","displayDocTitle":"First-Order Recurrent Neural Networks and Deterministic Finite State Automata","volume":"6","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First-Order Recurrent Neural Networks and Deterministic Finite State Automata","sourcePdf":"neco1994661155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025501S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"6795388","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6795895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795898,"authors":[{"name":"Alan F.

How it does this is not well understood and continues to be a question of fundamental and practical interest. In this paper we present a new quantitative approach to shape-from-shading that may provide some answers. We suggest that the brain, through evolution or prior experience, has discovered that objects can be classified into lower-dimensional object-classes as to their shape. Extraction of shape from shading is then equivalent to the much simpler problem of parameter estimation in a low-dimensional space. We carry out this proposal for an important class of three-dimensional (3D) objects: human heads. From an ensemble of several hundred laser-scanned 3D heads, we use principal component analysis to derive a low-dimensional parameterization of head shape space. An algorithm for solving shape-from-shading using this representation is presented. It works well even on real images where it is able to recover the 3D surface for a given person, maintaining facial detail and identity, from a single 2D image of his face. This algorithm has applications in face recognition and animation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795795/06795900.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1340","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/neco.1996.8.6.1321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1996.8.6.1321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795795","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Approach to Shape from Shading: Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Face Surfaces from Single Two-Dimensional Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Approach to Shape from Shading: Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Face Surfaces from Single Two-Dimensional Images","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Approach to Shape from Shading: Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Face Surfaces from Single Two-Dimensional Images","sourcePdf":"neco1996861321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063712S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"6795795","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"89","articleId":"6795900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795918,"authors":[{"name":"Sean Escola","affiliation":["Center for Theoretical Neuroscience and Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, U.S.A. sean@neurotheory.columbia.edu"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Escola"},{"name":"Alfredo Fontanini","affiliation":["Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, U.S.A. alfredo.fontanini@stonybrook.edu"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Fontanini"},{"name":"Don Katz","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02453, U.S.A. dbkatz@brandeis.edu"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Katz"},{"name":"Liam Paninski","affiliation":["Center for Theoretical Neuroscience and Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, U.S.A. liam@stat.columbia.edu"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"Paninski"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795918","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Given recent experimental results suggesting that neural circuits may evolve through multiple firing states, we develop a framework for estimating state-dependent neural response properties from spike train data.

For maximal flexibility, we allow external, time-varying stimuli and the neurons\u2019 own spike histories to drive both the spiking behavior in each state and the transitioning behavior between states. We employ an appropriately modified expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The expectation step is solved by the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The maximization step reduces to a set of separable concave optimization problems if the model is restricted slightly. We first test our algorithm on simulated data and are able to fully recover the parameters used to generate the data and accurately recapitulate the sequence of hidden states. We then apply our algorithm to a recently published data set in which the observed neuronal ensembles displayed multistate behavior and show that inclusion of spike history information significantly improves the fit of the model. Additionally, we show that a simple reformulation of the state space of the underlying Markov chain allows us to implement a hybrid half-multistate, half-histogram model that may be more appropriate for capturing the complexity of certain data sets than either a simple HMM or a simple peristimulus time histogram model alone.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00118","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795549/06795918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795549","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Models for the Stimulus-Response Relationships of Multistate Neural Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Models for the Stimulus-Response Relationships of Multistate Neural Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Models for the Stimulus-Response Relationships of Multistate Neural Systems","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024211S","chronDate":"May  2011","isNumber":"6795549","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6795918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6795928,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Vapnik","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Vapnik"},{"name":"Esther Levin","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Esther","lastName":"Levin"},{"name":"Yann Le Cun","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Yann Le","lastName":"Cun"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795928","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"abstract":"A method for measuring the capacity of learning machines is described.

We define the representation error and the prediction error. The representation error measures how well the environment is represented by the network after learning. The prediction error is the average error that a continually learning network makes on the next example. In the neighborhood of a local minimum of the error surface, we calculate these errors. We find that the more predictable the example presentation, the higher the representation error, i.e., the less accurate the asymptotic representation of the whole environment. Furthermore we study the learning process in the presence of a plateau. Plateaus are flat spots on the error surface, which can severely slow down the learning process. In particular, they are notorious in applications with multilayer perceptrons. Our results, which are confirmed by simulations of a multilayer perceptron learning a chaotic time series using backpropagation, explain how dependencies between examples can help the learning process to escape from a plateau.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1996.8.8.1743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1996.8.8.1743","startPage":"1743","endPage":"1765","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795299/06795960.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Dependencies between Successive Examples Affect On-Line Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1996","displayDocTitle":"How Dependencies between Successive Examples Affect On-Line Learning","publicationDate":"Nov. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","volume":"8","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6795960/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Dependencies between Successive Examples Affect On-Line Learning","sourcePdf":"neco1996881743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020491S","chronDate":"Nov.  1996","isNumber":"6795299","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6795960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6795963,"authors":[{"name":"Sepp Hochreiter","affiliation":["Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, 80290 M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sepp","lastName":"Hochreiter"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber","affiliation":["IDSIA, Corso Elvezia 36, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Schmidhuber"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6795963","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9785,"citationCountPatent":257,"totalDownloads":189},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6795963","abstract":"Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow.

Optimization is performed using a mixed variable extension to the generalized pattern search method. This method offers the advantage that categorical variables, such as neural transfer functions and nodal connectivities, can be used as parameters in optimization. When used together with a surrogate, the resulting algorithm is highly efficient for expensive objective functions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in optimizing an ANN for the number of neurons, the type of transfer function, and the connectivity among neurons. The optimization method is applied to a chemistry approximation of practical relevance. In this application, temperature and a chemical source term are approximated as functions of two independent parameters using optimal ANNs. Comparison of the performance of optimal ANNs with conventional tabulation methods demonstrates equivalent accuracy by considerable savings in memory storage. The architecture of the optimal ANN for the approximation of the chemical source term consists of a fully connected feedforward network having four nonlinear hidden layers and 117 synaptic weights. An equivalent representation of the chemical source term using tabulation techniques would require a 500 \u00d7 500 grid point discretization of the parameter space.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2007.08-06-316","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795359/06796021.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"601","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2007.08-06-316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of Optimal Artificial Neural Networks Using a Pattern Search Algorithm: Application to Approximation of Chemical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Generation of Optimal Artificial Neural Networks Using a Pattern Search Algorithm: Application to Approximation of Chemical Systems","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of Optimal Artificial Neural Networks Using a Pattern Search Algorithm: Application to Approximation of Chemical Systems","sourcePdf":"neco200708-06-316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040846S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","isNumber":"6795359","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6796021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796038,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyu Tian","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Zhiyu","lastName":"Tian"},{"name":"Ting-Ting Y.

To overcome this loss, two networks that were separately trained on populations of patients with different likelihoods of myocardial infarction were used in concert. One network was trained on clinical pattern sets derived from patients who had a low likelihood of myocardial infarction, while the other was trained on pattern sets derived from patients with a high likelihood of myocardial infarction. Unknown patterns were analyzed by both networks. If the output generated by the network trained on the low risk patients was below an empirically set threshold, this output was chosen as the diagnostic output. If the output was above that threshold, the output of the network trained on the high risk patients was used as the diagnostic output. The dual network correctly identified 39 of the 40 patients who had sustained a myocardial infarction and 301 of 306 patients who did not have a myocardial infarction for a detection rate (sensitivity) and false alarm rate (1-specificity) of 97.50 and 1.63%, respectively.

Results concerning the root spaces of the Lie algebras associated with these Weyl groups are then used to derive sets of simple equations for minimal sufficient search sets in weight space. These sets, which take the geometric forms of a wedge and a cone, occupy only a minute fraction of the volume of weight space. A separate analysis shows that large numbers of copies of a network performance function optimum weight vector are created by the action of the equioutput transformation group and that these copies all lie on the same sphere. Some implications of these results for learning are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Geometry of Feedforward Neural Network Error Surfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Geometry of Feedforward Neural Network Error Surfaces","sourcePdf":"neco199356910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024076S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6795386","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6796044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6796052,"authors":[{"name":"Rudy Setiono","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge, Singapore 0511, Republic of Singapore"],"firstName":"Rudy","lastName":"Setiono"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796052","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796052","abstract":"An algorithm for extracting rules from a standard three-layer feedforward neural network is proposed. The trained network is first pruned not only to remove redundant connections in the network but, more important, to detect the relevant inputs. The algorithm generates rules from the pruned network by considering only a small number of activation values at the hidden units. If the number of inputs connected to a hidden unit is sufficiently small, then rules that describe how each of its activation values is obtained can be readily generated. Otherwise the hidden unit will be split and treated as output units, with each output unit corresponding to an activation value. A hidden layer is inserted and a new subnetwork is formed, trained, and pruned. This process is repeated until every hidden unit in the network has a relatively small number of input units connected to it. Examples on how the proposed algorithm works are shown using real-world data arising from molecular biology and signal processing. Our results show that for these complex problems, the algorithm can extract reasonably compact rule sets that have high predictive accuracy rates.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.205","startPage":"205","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795420","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795420/06796052.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Rules from Neural Networks by Pruning and Hidden-Unit Splitting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796052/","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Rules from Neural Networks by Pruning and Hidden-Unit Splitting","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan. 1 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Rules from Neural Networks by Pruning and Hidden-Unit Splitting","sourcePdf":"neco199791205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025633S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 1997","isNumber":"6795420","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"45","articleId":"6796052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796060,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Battiti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica, Universit\u00e0 di Trento, 38050 Povo (Trento), Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Battiti"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796060","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":213,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"abstract":"On-line first-order backpropagation is sufficiently fast and effective for many large-scale classification problems but for very high precision mappings, batch processing may be the method of choice.

The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal).

Here we pursue the question of whether this picture can be justified and study the four-dimensional neuron model of Hodgkin and Huxley as a concrete example. The model is approximated by a response kernel expansion in terms of a single variable, the membrane voltage. The first-order term is linear in the input and its kernel has the typical form of an elementary postsynaptic potential. Higher-order kernels take care of nonlinear interactions between input spikes. In contrast to the standard Volterra expansion, the kernels depend on the firing time of the most recent output spike. In particular, a zero-order kernel that describes the shape of the spike and the typical after-potential is included. Our model neuron fires if the membrane voltage, given by the truncated response kernel expansion, crosses a threshold. The threshold model is tested on a spike train generated by the Hodgkin-Huxley model with a stochastic input current. We find that the threshold model predicts 90 percent of the spikes correctly.

The hierarchical generative model allows us to handle variations in sequence length and sampling interval gracefully. We also give nonparametric kernels not based on generative models, but rather on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply the methods to detecting cognitive decline from longitudinal clinical data on motor and neuropsychological tests. The likelihood ratio classifiers based on the neuropsychological tests perform better than than classifiers based on the motor behavior. Discriminant classifiers performed better than likelihood ratio classifiers for the motor behavior tests.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00164","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795237/06796175.pdf","startPage":"2390","endPage":"2420","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernels for Longitudinal Data with Variable Sequence Length and Sampling Intervals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Kernels for Longitudinal Data with Variable Sequence Length and Sampling Intervals","volume":"23","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernels for Longitudinal Data with Variable Sequence Length and Sampling Intervals","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061937S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6795237","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6796175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6796177,"authors":[{"name":"Teuvo Kohonen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Neural Networks Research Centre, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Teuvo","lastName":"Kohonen"},{"name":"Samuel Kaski","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Neural Networks Research Centre, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Kaski"},{"name":"Harri Lappalainen","affiliation":["Helsinki University of Technology, Neural Networks Research Centre, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Harri","lastName":"Lappalainen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796177","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796177","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.6.1321","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795361/06796177.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.6.1321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Organized Formation of Various Invariant-Feature Filters in the Adaptive-Subspace SOM","abstract":"The adaptive-subspace self-organizing map (ASSOM) is a modular neural network architecture, the modules of which learn to identify input patterns subject to some simple transformations.

A comparison between the two-spike interaction function and the higher-order interaction functions reveals profound differences. In particular, we show that the two-spike interaction function cannot support stable, competitive synaptic plasticity, such as that seen during neuronal development, without including modifications designed specifically to stabilize its behavior. In contrast, we show that all the higher-order interaction functions exhibit a fixed-point structure consistent with the presence of competitive synaptic dynamics. This difference originates in the unification of our proposed \u201cswitch\u201d mechanism for synaptic plasticity, coupling synaptic depression and synaptic potentiation processes together. While three or more spikes are required to probe this coupling, two spikes can never do so. We conclude that this coupling is critical to the presence of competitive dynamics and that multispike interactions are therefore vital to understanding synaptic competition.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2006.18.10.2414","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"2414","endPage":"2464","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795503/06796196.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.10.2414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable Competitive Dynamics Emerge from Multispike Interactions in a Stochastic Model of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Stable Competitive Dynamics Emerge from Multispike Interactions in a Stochastic Model of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity","volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796196/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable Competitive Dynamics Emerge from Multispike Interactions in a Stochastic Model of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity","sourcePdf":"neco200618102414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025635S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","isNumber":"6795503","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6796196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796205,"authors":[{"name":"Youshen Xia","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, China. ysxia2001@yahoo.com"],"firstName":"Youshen","lastName":"Xia"},{"name":"Dongyi Ye","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, China. yiedy@fzu.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Dongyi","lastName":"Ye"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796205","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796205","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.10-06-389","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795758/06796205.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"2227","endPage":"2237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.10-06-389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Exponential Convergence Conditions of an Extended Projection Neural Network","abstract":"Recently the extended projection neural network was proposed to solve constrained monotone variational inequality problems and a class of constrained nonmonotontic variational inequality problems.

In many brain structures, action potential activity is considered to be sparse. This sparseness of activity has been exploited to reduce the computational cost of large-scale network simulations, through the development of event-driven simulation schemes. However, existing event-driven simulations schemes use extremely simplified neuronal models. Here, we implement and evaluate critically an event-driven algorithm (ED-LUT) that uses precalculated look-up tables to characterize synaptic and neuronal dynamics. This approach enables the use of more complex (and realistic) neuronal models or data in representing the neurons, while retaining the advantage of high-speed simulation. We demonstrate the method's application for neurons containing exponential synaptic conductances, thereby implementing shunting inhibition, a phenomenon that is critical to cellular computation. We also introduce an improved two-stage event-queue algorithm, which allows the simulations to scale efficiently to highly connected networks with arbitrary propagation delays. Finally, the scheme readily accommodates implementation of synaptic plasticity mechanisms that depend on spike timing, enabling future simulations to explore issues of long-term learning and adaptation in large-scale networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.2959","doi":"10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.2959","startPage":"2959","endPage":"2993","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795482/06796214.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796214/","displayDocTitle":"Event-Driven Simulation Scheme for Spiking Neural Networks Using Lookup Tables to Characterize Neuronal Dynamics","volume":"18","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Driven Simulation Scheme for Spiking Neural Networks Using Lookup Tables to Characterize Neuronal Dynamics","sourcePdf":"neco200618122959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024338S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","isNumber":"6795482","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"27","articleId":"6796214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":6796227,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Pedzisz","affiliation":["Imperial College London, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Communications and Signal Processing Group, London SW7 2AZ, U.K. m.pedzisz@imperial.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Pedzisz"},{"name":"Danilo P.

The MMSON's behavior is compared to aspects of brain function that deal with sensory integration. According to human behavioral studies, integration of signals from sensory receptors of different modalities enhances perception of objects and events and also reduces time to detection. In neocortex, integration takes place in bimodal and multimodal association areas and result, not only in feedback-mediated enhanced unimodal perception and shortened reaction time, but also in robust bimodal or multimodal percepts.

The problem is difficult since the capacity depends on coding, characteristics of the communication channel, and optimization over input distributions, among other issues. In this letter, we consider two models. The temporal coding model of a neuron as a communication channel assumes the output is \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>\u03c4</i></b>\n where \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>\u03c4</i></b>\n is a gamma-distributed random variable corresponding to the interspike interval, that is, the time it takes for the neuron to fire once. The rate coding model is similar; the output is the actual rate of firing over a fixed period of time. Theoretical studies prove that the distribution of inputs, which achieves channel capacity, is a discrete distribution with finite mass points for temporal and rate coding under a reasonable assumption. This allows us to compute numerically the capacity of a neuron. Numerical results are in a plausible range based on biological evidence to date.","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795215/06796269.pdf","startPage":"1714","endPage":"1748","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/neco.2009.05-08-792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2009.05-08-792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of a Single Spiking Neuron Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of a Single Spiking Neuron Channel","volume":"21","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of a Single Spiking Neuron Channel","sourcePdf":"neco200905-08-792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032289S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"6795215","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6796269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796272,"authors":[{"name":"Jianjun Tu","affiliation":["College of Science, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, 430033, China tujianjun1984@126.com"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Tu"},{"name":"Hanlin He","affiliation":["College of Science, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, 430033, China hanlinhe62@yahoo.com.cn"],"firstName":"Hanlin","lastName":"He"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796272","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796272","abstract":"Synchronization of cellular neural networks with time-varying delay is discussed in this letter.

Then the controller criterion is transformed from quadratic matrix inequality form into linear matrix inequality form, with the help of a sufficient and necessary transformation condition. The minimization of the guaranteed cost is studied, and a further criterion for getting the controller is presented.

They consist of a memoryless readout neuron that is trained on top of a randomly connected recurrent neural network. RC systems are commonly used in two flavors: with analog or binary (spiking) neurons in the recurrent circuits. Previous work indicated a fundamental difference in the behavior of these two implementations of the RC idea. The performance of an RC system built from binary neurons seems to depend strongly on the network connectivity structure. In networks of analog neurons, such clear dependency has not been observed. In this letter, we address this apparent dichotomy by investigating the influence of the network connectivity (parameterized by the neuron in-degree) on a family of network models that interpolates between analog and binary networks. Our analyses are based on a novel estimation of the Lyapunov exponent of the network dynamics with the help of branching process theory, rank measures that estimate the kernel quality and generalization capabilities of recurrent networks, and a novel mean field predictor for computational performance. These analyses reveal that the phase transition between ordered and chaotic network behavior of binary circuits qualitatively differs from the one in analog circuits, leading to differences in the integration of information over short and long timescales. This explains the decreased computational performance observed in binary circuits that are densely connected. The mean field predictor is also used to bound the memory function of recurrent circuits of binary neurons.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2009.01-09-947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2009.01-09-947","endPage":"1311","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795256/06796288.pdf","startPage":"1272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectivity, Dynamics, and Memory in Reservoir Computing with Binary and Analog Neurons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796288/","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity, Dynamics, and Memory in Reservoir Computing with Binary and Analog Neurons","volume":"22","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity, Dynamics, and Memory in Reservoir Computing with Binary and Analog Neurons","sourcePdf":"neco200901-09-947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037255S","chronDate":"May  2010","isNumber":"6795256","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6796288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796290,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoshen Li","affiliation":["Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, U.S.A. xsli@yahoo.com"],"firstName":"Xiaoshen","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Giorgio A.

This letter explores the relationship between the degree of synchrony among excitatory synapses and the linearity of the response using detailed compartmental models of cortical pyramidal cells. Synchronous input resulted in a linear input-output relationship, while asynchronous stimulation yielded sub- and supraproportional outputs at low and high frequencies, respectively. The dependence of input-output linearity on synchrony was sigmoidal and considerably robust with respect to dendritic location, stimulus irregularity, and alteration of active and synaptic properties. Moreover, synchrony affected firing rate differently at lower and higher input frequencies. A reduced integrate-and-fire model suggested a mechanism explaining these results based on spatiotemporal integration, with fundamental implications relating synchrony to memory encoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796290/","volume":"20","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Synaptic Synchrony on the Neuronal Input-Output Relationship","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Synaptic Synchrony on the Neuronal Input-Output Relationship","sourcePdf":"neco200810-06-385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027579S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"6795219","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6796290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6796297,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Girosi","affiliation":["Center for Biological and Computational Learning, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Girosi"},{"name":"Michael Jones","affiliation":["Center for Biological and Computational Learning, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Jones"},{"name":"Tomaso Poggio","affiliation":["Center for Biological and Computational Learning, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA"],"firstName":"Tomaso","lastName":"Poggio"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796297","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":246,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796297","abstract":"We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes that are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">regularization networks</i>\n. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known radial basis functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends radial basis functions (RBF) to hyper basis functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of projection pursuit regression, and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">generalized regularization networks</i>\n for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call generalized regularization networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are (1) radial basis functions that can be generalized to hyper basis functions, (2) some tensor product splines, and (3) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions, and several perceptron-like neural networks with one hidden layer.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795233","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795233/06796297.pdf","doi":"10.1162/neco.1995.7.2.219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1995.7.2.219","startPage":"219","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796297/","displayDocTitle":"Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures","sourcePdf":"neco199572219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020702S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"6795233","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"246","articleId":"6796297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796304,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We propose and demonstrate in this letter that spiking neural networks (SNN), consisting of spiking neurons that propagate information by the timing of spikes, are a better alternative to the coding scheme based on spike frequency (histogram) alone. The SNN model analyzes cortical neural spike trains directly without losing temporal information for generating more reliable motor command for cortically controlled prosthetics. In this letter, we compared the temporal pattern classification result from the SNN approach with results generated from firing-rate-based approaches: conventional artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and linear regression. The results show that the SNN algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy and identify the spiking activity related to movement control earlier than the other methods. Both are desirable characteristics for fast neural information processing and reliable control command pattern recognition for neuroprosthetic applications.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796357","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795538/06796357.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2009.10-08-885","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1085","doi":"10.1162/neco.2009.10-08-885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Spiking Neural Networks for Cortical Neuronal Spike Train Decoding","volume":"22","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"April 2010","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking Neural Networks for Cortical Neuronal Spike Train Decoding","sourcePdf":"neco200910-08-885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02123S","chronDate":"April  2010","isNumber":"6795538","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6796357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796363,"authors":[{"name":"Dongpo Xu","affiliation":["College of Science, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin 150001, People's Republic of China dongpoxu@gmail.com"],"firstName":"Dongpo","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Huisheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian 116026, People's Republic of China zhhuisheng@163.com"],"firstName":"Huisheng","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Lijun Liu","affiliation":["School of Science, Dalian Nationalities University, Dalian 116600, People's Republic of China cmliulj@yahoo.com.cn"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Liu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796363","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796363","abstract":"This letter presents a unified convergence analysis of the split-complex nonlinear gradient descent (SCNGD) learning algorithms for complex-valued recurrent neural networks, covering three classes of SCNGD algorithms: standard SCNGD, normalized SCNGD, and adaptive normalized SCNGD.

Representation of movements by neuronal populations varies over time, during both voluntary limb movements and movements controlled through BMIs, due to motor learning, neuronal plasticity, and instability in recordings. To ensure accurate BMI performance over long time spans, BMI decoders must adapt to these changes. We propose the Bayesian regression self-training method for updating the parameters of an unscented Kalman filter decoder. This novel paradigm uses the decoder's output to periodically update its neuronal tuning model in a Bayesian linear regression. We use two previously known statistical formulations of Bayesian linear regression: a joint formulation, which allows fast and exact inference, and a factorized formulation, which allows the addition and temporary omission of neurons from updates but requires approximate variational inference. To evaluate these methods, we performed offline reconstructions and closed-loop experiments with rhesus monkeys implanted cortically with microwire electrodes. Offline reconstructions used data recorded in areas M1, S1, PMd, SMA, and PP of three monkeys while they controlled a cursor using a handheld joystick. The Bayesian regression self-training updates significantly improved the accuracy of offline reconstructions compared to the same decoder without updates. We performed 11 sessions of real-time, closed-loop experiments with a monkey implanted in areas M1 and S1. These sessions spanned 29 days. The monkey controlled the cursor using the decoder with and without updates. The updates maintained control accuracy and did not require information about monkey hand movements, assumptions about desired movements, or knowledge of the intended movement goals as training signals. These results indicate that Bayesian regression self-training can maintain BMI control accuracy over long periods, making clinical neuroprosthetics more viable.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00207","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6796217/06796404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6796217","startPage":"3162","endPage":"3204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Decoding for Brain-Machine Interfaces Through Bayesian Parameter Updates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Decoding for Brain-Machine Interfaces Through Bayesian Parameter Updates","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Decoding for Brain-Machine Interfaces Through Bayesian Parameter Updates","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029267S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6796217","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6796404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796413,"authors":[{"name":"Si Wu","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QH, U.K. siwu@sussex.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Si","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Kosuke Hamaguchi","affiliation":["Amari Research Unit, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. kosuke.hamaguchi@univ-paris5.fr"],"firstName":"Kosuke","lastName":"Hamaguchi"},{"name":"Shun-ichi Amari","affiliation":["Amari Research Unit, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. amari@brain.riken.go.jp"],"firstName":"Shun-ichi","lastName":"Amari"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796413","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796413","abstract":"Continuous attractor is a promising model for describing the encoding of continuous stimuli in neural systems. In a continuous attractor, the stationary states of the neural system form a continuous parameter space, on which the system is neutrally stable. This property enables the neutral system to track time-varying stimuli smoothly, but it also degrades the accuracy of information retrieval, since these stationary states are easily disturbed by external noise. In this work, based on a simple model, we systematically investigate the dynamics and the computational properties of continuous attractors. In order to analyze the dynamics of a large-size network, which is otherwise extremely complicated, we develop a strategy to reduce its dimensionality by utilizing the fact that a continuous attractor can eliminate the noise components perpendicular to the attractor space very quickly. We therefore project the network dynamics onto the tangent of the attractor space and simplify it successfully as a one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Based on this simplified model, we investigate (1) the decoding error of a continuous attractor under the driving of external noisy inputs, (2) the tracking speed of a continuous attractor when external stimulus experiences abrupt changes, (3) the neural correlation structure associated with the specific dynamics of a continuous attractor, and (4) the consequence of asymmetric neural correlation on statistical population decoding. The potential implications of these results on our understanding of neural information processing are also discussed.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.10-06-378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.10-06-378","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795456/06796413.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"1025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics and Computation of Continuous Attractors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics and Computation of Continuous Attractors","volume":"20","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796413/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics and Computation of Continuous Attractors","sourcePdf":"neco200810-06-378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029265S","chronDate":"April  2008","isNumber":"6795456","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6796413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6796427,"authors":[{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Systems Biology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan bschen@ee.nthu.edu.tw"],"firstName":"Bor-Sen","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Cheng-Wei Li","affiliation":["Laboratory of Systems Biology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan d925908@oz.nthu.edu.tw"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wei","lastName":"Li"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796427","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"A nervous system consists of a large number of highly interconnected nerve cells.

A robust observer-based model reference tracking control is proposed for Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron systems to generate a desired reference response in spite of environmental noises, uncertain initial values, and diffusion currents from other interconnected nerve cells. In order to simplify the robust tracking control design of nonlinear stochastic HH neuron systems, a fuzzy interpolation method is employed to interpolate several linear stochastic systems to approximate a nonlinear stochastic HH neuron system so that the nonlinear robust tracking control problem can be solved by the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the help of Robust Control Toolbox in Matlab. The proposed robust observer-based tracking control scheme can provide new methods for desired action potential generation, suppression of oscillations, and blockage of action potential transmission under environmental noise and diffusion currents. These new methods are useful for patients with different neuron system dysfunctions. Finally, three simulation examples of tracking control of nervous systems are given to illustrate the design procedure and confirm the tracking performance of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Observer-Based Tracking Control of Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Systems Under Environmental Disturbances","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00053","endPage":"3178","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795789/06796427.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"3143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Robust Observer-Based Tracking Control of Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Systems Under Environmental Disturbances","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Observer-Based Tracking Control of Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Systems Under Environmental Disturbances","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019047S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"6795789","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6796427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796444,"authors":[{"name":"Song Chun Zhu","affiliation":["Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Song Chun","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Ying Nian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Ying Nian","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"David Mumford","affiliation":["Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, U.S.A."],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mumford"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796444","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796444","abstract":"This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called the minimax entropy principle, for building statistical models for images (or signals) in a variety of applications. This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795273","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795273/06796444.pdf","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1627","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimax Entropy Principle and Its Application to Texture Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 15 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 15 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796444/","displayDocTitle":"Minimax Entropy Principle and Its Application to Texture Modeling","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"15 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimax Entropy Principle and Its Application to Texture Modeling","sourcePdf":"neco1997981627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037695S","chronDate":"Nov. 15 1997","isNumber":"6795273","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"114","articleId":"6796444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796445,"authors":[{"name":"Doron Tal","affiliation":["Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215 USA"],"firstName":"Doron","lastName":"Tal"},{"name":"Eric L.

LIF neurons have mainly been used to model physiologically realistic spike trains, but little application of the LIF model appears to have been made in explicitly computational contexts. In this article, we show that the transfer function of a LIF neuron provides, over a wide parameter range, a compressive nonlinearity sufficiently close to that of the logarithm so that LIF neurons can be used to multiply neural signals by mere addition of their outputs yielding the logarithm of the product. A simulation of the LIF multiplier shows that under a wide choice of parameters, a LIF neuron can log-multiply its inputs to within a 5% relative error.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796445","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795497/06796445.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.2.305","startPage":"305","endPage":"318","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.2.305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb. 15 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 15 1997","displayDocTitle":"Computing with the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron: Logarithmic Computation and Multiplication","volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"15 Feb. 1997","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing with the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron: Logarithmic Computation and Multiplication","sourcePdf":"neco199792305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029978S","chronDate":"Feb. 15 1997","isNumber":"6795497","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6796445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6796458,"authors":[{"name":"Gleb Basalyga","affiliation":["gbasalyg@wfubmc.edu"],"firstName":"Gleb","lastName":"Basalyga"},{"name":"Emilio Salinas","affiliation":["esalinas@wfubmc.edu"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Salinas"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796458","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796458","abstract":"Cortical sensory neurons are known to be highly variable, in the sense that responses evoked by identical stimuli often change dramatically from trial to trial. The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2006.18.6.1349","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1379","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.6.1349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795432","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795432/06796458.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Response Variability Increases Neural Network Robustness to Synaptic Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796458/","displayDocTitle":"When Response Variability Increases Neural Network Robustness to Synaptic Noise","volume":"18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When Response Variability Increases Neural Network Robustness to Synaptic Noise","sourcePdf":"neco20061861349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020363S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"6795432","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6796458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-24"},{"_id":6796461,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A similar model has previously been shown to extract hippocampal spatial codes from quasi-natural videos.

Our networks learn faster than backpropagation for two reasons: the local representations ensure that only a few units respond to any given input, thus reducing computational overhead, and the hybrid learning rules are linear rather than nonlinear, thus leading to faster convergence.

In this work, we make use of rigorous mathematical results from the theory of continuous time point process filtering and show how optimal real-time state estimation and prediction may be implemented in a general setting using simple recurrent neural networks. The framework is applicable to many situations of common interest, including noisy observations, non-Poisson spike trains (incorporating adaptation), multisensory integration, and state prediction. The optimal network properties are shown to relate to the statistical structure of the environment, and the benefits of adaptation are studied and explicitly demonstrated.

Previous work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function. However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization. In this paper we show that for the purposes of network training, the regularization term can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct minimization of the regularized error function provides a practical alternative to training with noise.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1995.7.1.108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1995.7.1.108","startPage":"108","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795445/06796505.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training with Noise is Equivalent to Tikhonov Regularization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Training with Noise is Equivalent to Tikhonov Regularization","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training with Noise is Equivalent to Tikhonov Regularization","sourcePdf":"neco199571108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030937S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"6795445","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"149","articleId":"6796505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6796512,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhong Wu","affiliation":["MITACS Centre for Disease Modeling, and Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University, Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada wujh@mathstat.yorku.ca"],"firstName":"Jianhong","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Hossein Zivari-Piran","affiliation":["Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, York University, Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada hzp@mathstat.yorku.ca"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Zivari-Piran"},{"name":"John D.

The resultant selective output signaling mechanism does not require the addition of multiple hidden layers but instead is based on the assumption that the signal transmission velocity between input processing neurons and clustering neurons is proportional to the similarity between the input pattern and the feature vector (the top-down weights) of the clustering neuron. The mathematical model governing the evolution of the signal transmission delay, the short-term memory traces, and the long-term memory traces represents a new class of large-scale delay differential equations where the evolution of the delay is described by a nonlinear differential equation involving the similarity measure already noted.

Interreciprocity provides a theoretical argument to verify that both flow graphs implement the same overall weight update.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1994.6.2.296","startPage":"296","endPage":"306","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795342/06796559.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1994.6.2.296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relating Real-Time Backpropagation and Backpropagation-Through-Time: An Application of Flow Graph Interreciprocity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"Relating Real-Time Backpropagation and Backpropagation-Through-Time: An Application of Flow Graph Interreciprocity","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relating Real-Time Backpropagation and Backpropagation-Through-Time: An Application of Flow Graph Interreciprocity","sourcePdf":"neco199462296.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016131S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6795342","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6796559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796562,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Raphan","affiliation":["Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Neural Science, and Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences New York University, New York, NY 10003, U.S.A. raphan@cims.nyu.edu"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Raphan"},{"name":"Eero P.

Here, we consider the problem of obtaining a least squares estimator given a measurement process with known statistics (i.e., a likelihood function) and a set of unsupervised measurements, each arising from a corresponding true value drawn randomly from an unknown distribution. We develop a general expression for a nonparametric empirical Bayes least squares (NEBLS) estimator, which expresses the optimal least squares estimator in terms of the measurement density, with no explicit reference to the unknown (prior) density. We study the conditions under which such estimators exist and derive specific forms for a variety of different measurement processes. We further show that each of these NEBLS estimators may be used to express the mean squared estimation error as an expectation over the measurement density alone, thus generalizing Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which provides such an expression for the additive gaussian noise case. This error expression may then be optimized over noisy measurement samples, in the absence of supervised training data, yielding a generalized SURE-optimized parametric least squares (SURE2PLS) estimator. In the special case of a linear parameterization (i.e., a sum of nonlinear kernel functions), the objective function is quadratic, and we derive an incremental form for learning this estimator from data. We also show that combining the NEBLS form with its corresponding generalized SURE expression produces a generalization of the score-matching procedure for parametric density estimation. Finally, we have implemented several examples of such estimators, and we show that their performance is comparable to their optimal Bayesian or supervised regression counterparts for moderate to large amounts of data.","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795717/06796562.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least Squares Estimation Without Priors or Supervision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Least Squares Estimation Without Priors or Supervision","volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least Squares Estimation Without Priors or Supervision","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017516S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"6795717","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6796562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796565,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshua Bengio","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Rm 4G332, 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Yoshua","lastName":"Bengio"},{"name":"Yann LeCun","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Rm 4G332, 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"LeCun"},{"name":"Craig Nohl","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Rm 4G332, 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Nohl"},{"name":"Chris Burges","affiliation":["AT&T Bell Laboratories, Rm 4G332, 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, NJ 07733 USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Burges"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796565","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4},"abstract":"We introduce a new approach for on-line recognition of handwritten words written in unconstrained mixed style.

An important aspect of motor output is its timing in relation to external stimuli or to other components of a movement. Previous studies suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in the timing of movements. Here we describe a neural network model based on the synaptic organization of the cerebellum that can generate timed responses in the range of tens of milliseconds to seconds. In contrast to previous models, temporal coding emerges from the dynamics of the cerebellar circuitry and depends neither on conduction delays, arrays of elements with different time constants, nor populations of elements oscillating at different frequencies. Instead, time is extracted from the instantaneous granule cell population vector. The subset of active granule cells is time-varying due to the granule\u2014Golgi\u2014granule cell negative feedback. We demonstrate that the population vector of simulated granule cell activity exhibits dynamic, nonperiodic trajectories in response to a periodic input. With time encoded in this manner, the output of the network at a particular interval following the onset of a stimulus can be altered selectively by changing the strength of granule \u2192 Purkinje cell connections for those granule cells that are active during the target time window. The memory of the reinforcement at that interval is subsequently expressed as a change in Purkinje cell activity that is appropriately timed with respect to stimulus onset. Thus, the present model demonstrates that a network based on cerebellar circuitry can learn appropriately timed responses by encoding time as the population vector of granule cell activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Model of the Cerebellum: Temporal Discrimination and the Timing of Motor Responses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Model of the Cerebellum: Temporal Discrimination and the Timing of Motor Responses","sourcePdf":"neco19946138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0417S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6795521","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6796586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6796595,"authors":[{"name":"Chuanyi Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA"],"firstName":"Chuanyi","lastName":"Ji"},{"name":"Robert R.

This type of learning is thought to be involved in most of our daily routines. Although the concept of instruction-based learning has been studied for several decades, the exact neural mechanisms implementing this process remain unrevealed. One of the central questions in this regard is, How do neurons learn to reproduce template signals (instructions) encoded in precisely timed sequences of spikes? Here we present a model of supervised learning for biologically plausible neurons that addresses this question. In a set of experiments, we demonstrate that our approach enables us to train spiking neurons to reproduce arbitrary template spike patterns in response to given synaptic stimuli even in the presence of various sources of noise. We show that the learning rule can also be used for decision-making tasks. Neurons can be trained to classify categories of input signals based on only a temporal configuration of spikes. The decision is communicated by emitting precisely timed spike trains associated with given input categories. Trained neurons can perform the classification task correctly even if stimuli and corresponding decision times are temporally separated and the relevant information is consequently highly overlapped by the ongoing neural activity. Finally, we demonstrate that neurons can be trained to reproduce sequences of spikes with a controllable time shift with respect to target templates. A reproduced signal can follow or even precede the targets. This surprising result points out that spiking neurons can potentially be applied to forecast the behavior (firing times) of other reference neurons or networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"22","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with ReSuMe: Sequence Learning, Classification, and Spike Shifting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with ReSuMe: Sequence Learning, Classification, and Spike Shifting","sourcePdf":"neco200911-08-901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020146S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","isNumber":"6795422","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"103","articleId":"6796606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6796619,"authors":[{"name":"Dorit Baras","affiliation":["doritb@il.ibm.com"],"firstName":"Dorit","lastName":"Baras"},{"name":"Ron Meir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel rmeir@ee.technion.ac.il"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Meir"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796619","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":1},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning, Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity, and the BCM Rule","abstract":"Learning agents, whether natural or artificial, must update their internal parameters in order to improve their behavior over time.

Performance for these small vocabularies has often exceeded that of more conventional approaches. Physiological front ends have provided improved recognition accuracy in noise and a cochlea filter-bank that could be used in these front ends has been implemented using micro-power analog VLSI techniques. Techniques have been developed to scale networks up in size to handle larger vocabularies, to reduce training time, and to train nets with recurrent connections. Multilayer perceptron classifiers are being integrated into conventional continuous-speech recognizers. Neural net architectures have been developed to perform the computations required by vector quantizers, static pattern classifiers, and the Viterbi decoding algorithm.

The fly views two types of stimuli, corresponding to rotational and translational displacements. Second-order reconstructions require the manipulation of potentially very large matrices, which obstructs the use of this approach when there are many neurons. We avoid the computation and inversion of these matrices using a convenient set of basis functions to expand our variables in. This requires approximating the spike train four-point functions by combinations of two-point functions similar to relations, which would be true for gaussian stochastic processes. In our test case, this approximation does not reduce the quality of the reconstruction. The overall contribution to stimulus reconstruction of the second-order kernels, measured by the mean squared error, is only about 5% of the first-order contribution. Yet at specific stimulus-dependent instants, the addition of second-order kernels represents up to 100% improvement, but only for rotational stimuli. We present a perturbative scheme to facilitate the application of our method to weakly correlated neurons.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795556","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2557","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795556/06796624.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recording from Two Neurons: Second-Order Stimulus Reconstruction from Spike Trains and Population Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2010","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recording from Two Neurons: Second-Order Stimulus Reconstruction from Spike Trains and Population Coding","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recording from Two Neurons: Second-Order Stimulus Reconstruction from Spike Trains and Population Coding","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020459S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","isNumber":"6795556","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6796624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796639,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, the actual range of binocular disparities encountered in natural scenes extends over tens of degrees. This discrepancy suggests that there must be a mechanism for detecting whether the stimulus disparity is inside or outside the range of the preferred disparities in the population. Here, we compare the efficacy of several features derived from the population responses of phase-tuned disparity energy neurons in differentiating between in-range and out-of-range disparities. Interestingly, some features that might be appealing at first glance, such as the average activation across the population and the difference between the peak and average responses, actually perform poorly. On the other hand, normalizing the difference between the peak and average responses results in a reliable indicator. Using a probabilistic model of the population responses, we improve classification accuracy by combining multiple features. A decision rule that combines the normalized peak to average difference and the peak location significantly improves performance over decision rules based on either measure in isolation. In addition, classifiers using normalized difference are also robust to mismatch between the image statistics assumed by the model and the actual image statistics.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.05-07-532","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795346/06796650.pdf","startPage":"2464","endPage":"2490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.05-07-532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalization Enables Robust Validation of Disparity Estimates from Neural Populations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Normalization Enables Robust Validation of Disparity Estimates from Neural Populations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796650/","volume":"20","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalization Enables Robust Validation of Disparity Estimates from Neural Populations","sourcePdf":"neco200805-07-532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020882S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"6795346","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6796650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796654,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitry Gorinevsky","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl B f\u00fcr Mechanik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, D-80333 Munich 2, Germany"],"firstName":"Dimitry","lastName":"Gorinevsky"},{"name":"Thomas H.

The basic idea is to minimize the cost function, which is composed of the mapping error and the Jacobian error. Prior to developing the Jacobian learning rule, we develop an explicit and general method for computing the Jacobian of the neural network using the parameters computed in error backpropagation. Then the Jacobian learning rule is derived. The method is simpler and more general than tangent propagation (Simard, Victorri, Le Cun, & Denker, 1992). Through hybridization of the error backpropagation and the Jacobian learning, the hybrid learning algorithm is presented.

The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to displaywhat the associativememory has in mind.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1554","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795851/06796673.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets","volume":"18","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets","sourcePdf":"neco20061871527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015089S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"6795851","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"3056","articleId":"6796673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6796677,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

The proposed natural gradient algorithm with variable step-size parameter and variable momentum factor is therefore particularly well suited to blind source separation in a time-varying environment, such as an abruptly changing mixing matrix or signal power. The expected improvement in the convergence speed, stability, and tracking ability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by extensive simulation results in both time-invariant and time-varying environments. The ability of the proposed algorithm to separate extremely weak or badly scaled sources is also verified.

Two important theoretical properties of piecewise-linear neural networks are proved, allowing an elaboration of the basic ideas of the approach into several variants of an algorithm for the extraction of Boolean rules. That algorithm has already been used in two real-world applications. Finally, a connection to the extraction of rules of the \u0141ukasiewicz logic is established, relying on recent results about rational McNaughton functions.

Despite all efforts, existing attempts at matching parts of the human visual system's extraordinary ability to understand visual scenes lack either scope or power. By combining the advantages of general low-level generative models and powerful layer-based and hierarchical models, this work aims at being a first step toward richer, more flexible models of images. After comparing various types of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) able to model continuous-valued data, we introduce our basic model, the masked RBM, which explicitly models occlusion boundaries in image patches by factoring the appearance of any patch region from its shape. We then propose a generative model of larger images using a field of such RBMs. Finally, we discuss how masked RBMs could be stacked to form a deep model able to generate more complicated structures and suitable for various tasks such as segmentation or object recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning a Generative Model of Images by Factoring Appearance and Shape","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning a Generative Model of Images by Factoring Appearance and Shape","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03601S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"6795558","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6796800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796810,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Ratcliff","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Ratcliff"},{"name":"Gail McKoon","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Gail","lastName":"McKoon"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796810","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796810","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795456/06796810.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.12-06-420","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.12-06-420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795456","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Diffusion Decision Model: Theory and Data for Two-Choice Decision Tasks","abstract":"The diffusion decision model allows detailed explanations of behavior in two-choice discrimination tasks.

Thereby evolutionary algorithms implemented by neuro- nal circuits can play a role in cognition. Replication of structured neuronal representations is assumed in several cognitive architectures. Replicators overcome some limitations of selectionist models of neuronal search. Hebbian learning is combined with replication to structure exploration on the basis of associations learned in the past. Neuromodulatory gating of sets of bistable neurons allows patterns of activation to be copied with mutation. If the probability of copying a set is related to the utility of that set, then an evolutionary algorithm can be implemented at rapid timescales in the brain. Populations of neuronal replicators can undertake a more rapid and stable search than can be achieved by serial modification of a single solution. Hebbian learning added to neuronal replication allows a powerful structuring of variability capable of learning the location of a global optimum from multiple previously visited local optima. Replication of solutions can solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in the stability-plasticity dilemma. In short, neuronal replication is essential to explain several features of flexible cognition.

It follows that statistical theory can provide considerable insight into the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of different network learning methods. We review concepts and analytical results from the literatures of mathematical statistics, econometrics, systems identification, and optimization theory relevant to the analysis of learning in artificial neural networks. Because of the considerable variety of available learning procedures and necessary limitations of space, we cannot provide a comprehensive treatment. Our focus is primarily on learning procedures for feedforward networks. However, many of the concepts and issues arising in this framework are also quite broadly relevant to other network learning paradigms. In addition to providing useful insights, the material reviewed here suggests some potentially useful new training methods for artificial neural networks.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1989.1.4.425","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795285/06796856.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1989.1.4.425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in Artificial Neural Networks: A Statistical Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796856/","displayDocTitle":"Learning in Artificial Neural Networks: A Statistical Perspective","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in Artificial Neural Networks: A Statistical Perspective","sourcePdf":"neco198914425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025968S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"6795285","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"147","articleId":"6796856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796861,"authors":[{"name":"Tommi Jaakkola","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA"],"firstName":"Tommi","lastName":"Jaakkola"},{"name":"Michael I.

Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power.

During training, patterns of activity are sequentially imposed on the input neurons, and an additional instructor signal drives the output neurons toward the desired activity. The network is made of integrate-and-fire neurons with constant leak and a floor. The synapses are bistable, and they are modified by the arrival of presynaptic spikes. The sign of the change is determined by both the depolarization and the state of a variable that integrates the postsynaptic action potentials. Following the training phase, the instructor signal is removed, and the output neurons are driven purely by the activity of the input neurons weighted by the plastic synapses. In the absence of stimulation, the synapses preserve their internal state indefinitely. Memories are also very robust to the disruptive action of spontaneous activity. A network of 2000 input neurons is shown to be able to classify correctly a large number (thousands) of highly overlapping patterns (300 classes of preprocessed Latex characters, 30 patterns per class, and a subset of the NIST characters data set) and to generalize with performances that are better than or comparable to those of artificial neural networks. Finally we show that the synaptic dynamics is compatible with many of the experimental observations on the induction of long-term modifications (spike-timing-dependent plasticity and its dependence on both the postsynaptic depolarization and the frequency of pre- and postsynaptic neurons).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","volume":"19","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning Real-World Stimuli in a Neural Network with Spike-Driven Synaptic Dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Real-World Stimuli in a Neural Network with Spike-Driven Synaptic Dynamics","sourcePdf":"neco200719112881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031985S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"6795907","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"89","articleId":"6796906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6796909,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Yuan Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, National Pingtung University of Education, Pingtung, Taiwan 900, R.O.C. cycheng@mail.npue.edu.tw"],"firstName":"Chang-Yuan","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Chih-Wen Shih","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300, R.O.C. cwshih@math.nctu.edu.tw"],"firstName":"Chih-Wen","lastName":"Shih"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796909","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796909","abstract":"We investigate the complete stability for multistable delayed neural networks.

In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BCI system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a nonnegligible portion of participants (estimated 15%\u201330%) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subject-independent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features\u2019 drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak at the beginning of the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"March 2011","volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Machine-Learning-Based Coadaptive Calibration for Brain-Computer Interfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine-Learning-Based Coadaptive Calibration for Brain-Computer Interfaces","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037741S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"6795558","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"42","articleId":"6796914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6796927,"authors":[{"name":"Jihong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Eng., Chungnam National University, Kung-dong, Taejon 305-764, Korea"],"firstName":"Jihong","lastName":"Lee"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796927","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796927","abstract":"A multilayer feedforward neural network and a design method that takes the distribution of given training patterns into consideration are proposed.

First, we arrive at a suboptimal solution to the sequential estimate that can be mapped by a growing gaussian radial basis function (GaRBF) network. This network adds hidden units for each observation. The function space approach in which the estimates are represented as vectors in a function space is used in developing a growth criterion to limit its growth. A simplification of the criterion leads to two joint criteria on the distance of the present pattern and the existing unit centers in the input space and on the approximation error of the network for the given observation to be satisfied together. This network is similar to the resource allocating network (RAN) (Platt 1991a) and hence RAN can be interpreted from a function space approach to sequential learning. Second, we present an enhancement to the RAN. The RAN either allocates a new unit based on the novelty of an observation or adapts the network parameters by the LMS algorithm. The function space interpretation of the RAN lends itself to an enhancement of the RAN in which the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm is used in place of the LMS algorithm. The performance of the RAN and the enhanced network are compared in the experimental tasks of function approximation and time-series prediction demonstrating the superior performance of the enhanced network with fewer number of hidden units. The approach adopted here has led us toward the minimal network required for a sequential learning problem.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1993.5.6.954","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795386/06796942.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1993.5.6.954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Function Estimation Approach to Sequential Learning with Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796942/","displayDocTitle":"A Function Estimation Approach to Sequential Learning with Neural Networks","volume":"5","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Function Estimation Approach to Sequential Learning with Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"neco199356954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029283S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6795386","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"156","articleId":"6796942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796944,"authors":[{"name":"Christian W.

The desired finite-state network dynamics is achieved by programming a small subset of all weights. A worst case analysis reveals a relationship between the weight strength and the maximum allowed network size, which guarantees finite-state behavior of the constructed network. We illustrate the method by encoding random DFAs with 10, 100, and 1000 states. While the theory predicts that the weight strength scales with the DFA size, we find empirically the weight strength to be almost constant for all the random DFAs. These results can be explained by noting that the generated DFAs represent average cases. We empirically demonstrate the existence of extreme DFAs for which the weight strength scales with DFA size.","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795223/06796944.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"696","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/neco.1996.8.4.675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1996.8.4.675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable Encoding of Large Finite-State Automata in Recurrent Neural Networks with Sigmoid Discriminants","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1996","displayDocTitle":"Stable Encoding of Large Finite-State Automata in Recurrent Neural Networks with Sigmoid Discriminants","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable Encoding of Large Finite-State Automata in Recurrent Neural Networks with Sigmoid Discriminants","sourcePdf":"neco199684675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06591S","chronDate":"May  1996","isNumber":"6795223","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6796944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6796951,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Gisl\u00e9n","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Lund, S\u00f6lvegatan 14A, S-22362 Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Gisl\u00e9n"},{"name":"Carsten Peterson","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Lund, S\u00f6lvegatan 14A, S-22362 Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Peterson"},{"name":"Bo S\u00f6derberg","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Lund, S\u00f6lvegatan 14A, S-22362 Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"S\u00f6derberg"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796951","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796951","abstract":"In a recent paper (Gisl\u00e9n \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n 1989) a convenient encoding and an efficient mean field algorithm for solving scheduling problems using a Potts neural network was developed and numerically explored on simplified and synthetic problems.

The decay time of the current depends on the synaptic receptor's type and ranges from a few (e.g., AMPA receptors) to a few hundred milliseconds (e.g., NMDA receptors). The role of the variety of synaptic timescales, several of them coexisting in the same neuron, is at present not understood. A prime question to answer is which is the effect of temporal filtering at different timescales of the incoming spike trains on the neuron's response. Here, based on our previous work on linear synaptic filtering, we build a general theory for the stationary firing response of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons receiving stochastic inputs filtered by one, two, or multiple synaptic channels, each characterized by an arbitrary timescale. The formalism applies to arbitrary IF model neurons and arbitrary forms of input noise (i.e., not required to be gaussian or to have small amplitude), as well as to any form of synaptic filtering (linear or nonlinear). The theory determines with exact analytical expressions the firing rate of an IF neuron for long synaptic time constants using the adiabatic approach. The correlated spiking (cross-correlations function) of two neurons receiving common as well as independent sources of noise is also described. The theory is illustrated using leaky, quadratic, and noise-thresholded IF neurons. Although the adiabatic approach is exact when at least one of the synaptic timescales is long, it provides a good prediction of the firing rate even when the timescales of the synapses are comparable to that of the leak of the neuron; it is not required that the synaptic time constants are longer than the mean interspike intervals or that the noise has small variance. The distribution of the potential for general IF neurons is also characterized. Our results provide powerful analytical tools that can allow a quantitative description of the dynamics of neuronal networks with realistic synaptic dynamics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6796970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","volume":"22","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Response of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons to Noisy Inputs Filtered by Synapses with Arbitrary Timescales: Firing Rate and Correlations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Response of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons to Noisy Inputs Filtered by Synapses with Arbitrary Timescales: Firing Rate and Correlations","sourcePdf":"neco201006-09-1036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024886S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"6795412","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"6796970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6796972,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-ichi Amari","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun-ichi","lastName":"Amari"},{"name":"Naotake Fujita","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113, Japan"],"firstName":"Naotake","lastName":"Fujita"},{"name":"Shigeru Shinomoto","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Shinomoto"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6796972","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6796972","doi":"10.1162/neco.1992.4.4.605","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795405/06796972.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","startPage":"605","endPage":"618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1992.4.4.605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four Types of Learning Curves","abstract":"If machines are learning to make decisions given a number of examples, the generalization error \u03f5(\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n) is defined as the average probability that an incorrect decision is made for a new example by a machine when trained with \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n examples.

We rigorously derive and analyze the objective functions that are minimized by the noise-affected training processes. We show that input noise and weight noise encourage the neural-network output to be a smooth function of the input or its weights, respectively. In the weak-noise limit, noise added to the output of the neural networks only changes the objective function by a constant. Hence, it cannot improve generalization. Input noise introduces penalty terms in the objective function that are related to, but distinct from, those found in the regularization approaches. Simulations have been performed on a regression and a classification problem to further substantiate our analysis. Input noise is found to be effective in improving the generalization performance for both problems.

These strategies can lead to computationally efficient algorithms for simulating large-scale networks of neurons; most important, such approaches are more precise than traditional clock-driven numerical integration approaches because the timing of spikes is treated exactly. The drawback of such event-driven methods is that in order to be efficient, the membrane equations must be solvable analytically, or at least provide simple analytic approximations for the state variables describing the system. This requirement prevents, in general, the use of conductance-based synaptic interactions within the framework of event-driven simulations and, thus, the investigation of network paradigms where synaptic conductances are important. We propose here a number of extensions of the classical leaky IF neuron model involving approximations of the membrane equation with conductancebased synaptic current, which lead to simple analytic expressions for the membrane state, and therefore can be used in the event-driven framework. These conductance-based IF (gIF) models are compared to commonly used models, such as the leaky IF model or biophysical models in which conductances are explicitly integrated. All models are compared with respect to various spiking response properties in the presence of synaptic activity, such as the spontaneous discharge statistics, the temporal precision in resolving synaptic inputs, and gain modulation under in vivo\u2013like synaptic bombardment. Being based on the passive membrane equation with fixed-threshold spike generation, the proposed gIF models are situated in between leaky IF and biophysical models but are much closer to the latter with respect to their dynamic behavior and response characteristics, while still being nearly as computationally efficient as simple IF neuron models. gIF models should therefore provide a useful tool for efficient and precise simulation of large-scale neuronal networks with realistic, conductance-based synaptic interactions.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2006.18.9.2146","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795417/06797005.pdf","startPage":"2146","endPage":"2210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.9.2146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797005/","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Models with Conductance-Based Dynamics for Event-Driven Simulation Strategies","volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Models with Conductance-Based Dynamics for Event-Driven Simulation Strategies","sourcePdf":"neco20061892146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024349S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","isNumber":"6795417","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6797005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":6797024,"authors":[{"name":"Kazumi Saito","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, 2 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto 619-02 Japan"],"firstName":"Kazumi","lastName":"Saito"},{"name":"Ryohei Nakano","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, 2 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto 619-02 Japan"],"firstName":"Ryohei","lastName":"Nakano"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797024","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797024","abstract":"Second-order learning algorithms based on quasi-Newton methods have two problems.

In order to provide desirable performance, an efficient and reasonably accurate line search is needed. To overcome these problems, we propose a new second-order learning algorithm. Descent direction is calculated on the basis of a partial Broydon-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) update with 2Ns memory space (s \u00ab N), and a reasonably accurate step length is efficiently calculated as the minimal point of a second-order approximation to the objective function with respect to the step length. Our experiments, which use a parity problem and a speech synthesis problem, have shown that the proposed algorithm outperformed major learning algorithms. Moreover, it turned out that an efficient and accurate step-length calculation plays an important role for the convergence of quasi-Newton algorithms, and a partial BFGS update greatly saves storage space without losing the convergence performance.","doi":"10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.123","startPage":"123","endPage":"141","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795420","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795420/06797024.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial BFGS Update and Efficient Step-Length Calculation for Three-Layer Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797024/","displayDocTitle":"Partial BFGS Update and Efficient Step-Length Calculation for Three-Layer Neural Networks","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan. 1 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial BFGS Update and Efficient Step-Length Calculation for Three-Layer Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"neco199791123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043682S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 1997","isNumber":"6795420","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6797024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6797025,"authors":[{"name":"Paul C.

We describe how IS-NMF is underlaid by a well-defined statistical model of superimposed gaussian components and is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of variance parameters. This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.","doi":"10.1162/neco.2008.04-08-771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2008.04-08-771","startPage":"793","endPage":"830","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6795310/06797100.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6795310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the Itakura-Saito Divergence: With Application to Music Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the Itakura-Saito Divergence: With Application to Music Analysis","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the Itakura-Saito Divergence: With Application to Music Analysis","sourcePdf":"neco200804-08-771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038378S","chronDate":"March  2009","isNumber":"6795310","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"421","articleId":"6797100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6797108,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo D.

We bridge the gap across multiple levels of analysis, from neural models of corticostriatal circuits\u2014the basal ganglia (BG) model (Frank, \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2005</xref>\n, \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2006</xref>\n) to simpler but mathematically tractable diffusion models of two-choice decision making. Specifically, we generated simulated data from the BG model and fit the diffusion model (Ratcliff, \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1978</xref>\n) to it. The standard diffusion model fits underestimated response times under conditions of high response and reinforcement conflict. Follow-up fits showed good fits to the data both by increasing nondecision time and by raising decision thresholds as a function of conflict and by allowing this threshold to collapse with time. This profile captures the role and dynamics of the subthalamic nucleus in BG circuitry, and as such, parametric modulations of projection strengths from this nucleus were associated with parametric increases in decision boundary and its modulation by conflict. We then present data from a human reinforcement learning experiment involving decisions with low- and high-reinforcement conflict. Again, the standard model failed to fit the data, but we found that two variants similar to those that fit the BG model data fit the experimental data, thereby providing a convergence of theoretical accounts of complex interactive decision-making mechanisms consistent with available data. This work also demonstrates how to make modest modifications to diffusion models to summarize core computations of the BG model. The result is a better fit and understanding of reinforcement-based choice data than that which would have occurred with either model alone.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00270","startPage":"1186","endPage":"1229","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797206/06797207.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement-Based Decision Making in Corticostriatal Circuits: Mutual Constraints by Neurocomputational and Diffusion Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement-Based Decision Making in Corticostriatal Circuits: Mutual Constraints by Neurocomputational and Diffusion Models","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement-Based Decision Making in Corticostriatal Circuits: Mutual Constraints by Neurocomputational and Diffusion Models","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056975S","chronDate":"May  2012","isNumber":"6797206","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6797207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6797209,"authors":[{"name":"Eric D.

We hypothesized that higher levels of immersion would benefit such tasks if the mental activity could be mapped to objects or locations in a 3D environment. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed an experiment in which participants memorized procedures in a virtual environment and then attempted to recall those procedures. We aimed to understand the effects of three components of immersion on performance. The results demonstrate that a matched software field of view (SFOV), a higher physical field of view (FOV), and a higher field of regard (FOR) all contributed to more effective memorization. The best performance was achieved with a matched SFOV and either a high FOV or a high FOR, or both. In addition, our experiment demonstrated that memorization in a virtual environment could be transferred to the real world. The results suggest that, for procedure memorization tasks, increasing the level of immersion even to moderate levels, such as those found in head mounted displays (HMDs) and display walls, can improve performance significantly compared to lower levels of immersion. Hypothesizing that the performance improvements provided by higher levels of immersion can be attributed to enhanced spatial cues, we discuss the values and limitations of supplementing conceptual information with spatial information in educational VR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 1 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2010","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Higher Levels of Immersion on Procedure Memorization Performance and Implications for Educational Virtual Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Higher Levels of Immersion on Procedure Memorization Performance and Implications for Educational Virtual Environments","sourcePdf":"pres_a_00016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026431S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2010","isNumber":"6797208","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720227","citationCount":"21","articleId":"6797209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6797213,"authors":[{"name":"Ruslan Salakhutdinov","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G3, Canada rsalakhu@utstat.toronto.edu"],"firstName":"Ruslan","lastName":"Salakhutdinov"},{"name":"Geoffrey Hinton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G3, Canada hinton@cs.toronto.edu"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Hinton"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797213","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797213","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00311","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","abstract":"We present a new learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines that contain many layers of hidden variables. Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and 3D objects. We also show that the features discovered by deep Boltzmann machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feedforward neural nets, which are then discriminatively fine-tuned.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797212","startPage":"1967","endPage":"2006","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797212/06797213.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Learning Procedure for Deep Boltzmann Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Learning Procedure for Deep Boltzmann Machines","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Learning Procedure for Deep Boltzmann Machines","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020792S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"6797212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"94","articleId":"6797213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6797227,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Sterne","affiliation":["Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RF, U.K. sterne@fias.uni-frankfurt.de"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Sterne"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797227","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Recall Using Relative Spike Timing in a Spiking Neural Network","abstract":"We present a neural network that is capable of completing and correcting a spiking pattern given only a partial, noisy version. It operates in continuous time and represents information using the relative timing of individual spikes. The network is capable of correcting and recalling multiple patterns simultaneously. We analyze the network's performance in terms of information recall. We explore two measures of the capacity of the network: one that values the accurate recall of individual spike times and another that values only the presence or absence of complete patterns. Both measures of information are found to scale linearly in both the number of neurons and the period of the patterns, suggesting these are natural measures of network information. We show a smooth transition from encodings that provide precise spike times to flexible encodings that can encode many scenes. This makes it plausible that many diverse tasks could be learned with such an encoding.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00306","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797212/06797227.pdf","startPage":"2053","endPage":"2077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797227/","displayDocTitle":"Information Recall Using Relative Spike Timing in a Spiking Neural Network","volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Recall Using Relative Spike Timing in a Spiking Neural Network","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053009S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"6797212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6797227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797242,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00393","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797167/06797340.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical Movement Primitives: Learning Attractor Models for Motor Behaviors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797340/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical Movement Primitives: Learning Attractor Models for Motor Behaviors","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical Movement Primitives: Learning Attractor Models for Motor Behaviors","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023515S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6797167","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"396","articleId":"6797340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6797365,"authors":[{"name":"O.

As a result, the linear coordinate-descent (LiCD) algorithm transmits only one parameter per message as opposed to the min-sum algorithm, which transmits two parameters per message. We show that when the quadratic matrix is walk-summable, the LiCD algorithm converges. By taking the LiCD algorithm as a subroutine, we also fix the convergence issue for a general quadratic matrix. The LiCD algorithm works in either a synchronous or asynchronous message-passing manner. Experimental results show that for a general graph with multiple cycles, the LiCD algorithm has comparable convergence speed to the min-sum algorithm, thereby reducing the number of parameters to be transmitted and the computational complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00368","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797312/06797419.pdf","startPage":"3340","endPage":"3370","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Coordinate-Descent Message Passing for Quadratic Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Linear Coordinate-Descent Message Passing for Quadratic Optimization","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Coordinate-Descent Message Passing for Quadratic Optimization","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028701S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6797312","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6797419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6797421,"authors":[{"name":"Luqman R.

Bootstrapping is implemented for the optimized networks, providing an accurate estimate of a network's predicted values. Initially a simple linear predictor was used to assess the complexity of the data and was found to provide low prediction performance. A nonlinear ANN in the form of a single multilayer perceptron (MLP) was also used, providing a significant increase in prediction performance. The effect of the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons of the MLP was investigated and found to be effective in enhancing network performance with both a single and a double hidden layer investigated separately. A hybrid array of MLPs was investigated and compared against the single MLP architecture. The hybrid MLPs were found to classify all vectors of the validation set, presenting the highest degree of prediction accuracy. Adjustment of the number of hidden neurons was investigated, providing further performance gain. In addition, noise injection was investigated, proving successful for certain network designs. It was found that the best-performing MLP was that of the double-hidden-layer hybrid MLP network without the use of noise injection. Furthermore, the level of performance was examined when different numbers of OSNs used were varied from the maximum of 24 to only 5 OSNs. Finally, the ideal OSNs were identified that optimized network performance.

However, the issue of pattern recognition involving computational process from sensory encoding to synaptic learning remains underexplored, as most existing models or algorithms target only part of the computational process. Furthermore, many learning algorithms proposed in the literature neglect or pay little attention to sensory information encoding, which makes them incompatible with neural-realistic sensory signals encoded from real-world stimuli. By treating sensory coding and learning as a systematic process, we attempt to build an integrated model based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), which performs sensory neural encoding and supervised learning with precisely timed sequences of spikes. With emerging evidence of precise spike-timing neural activities, the view that information is represented by explicit firing times of action potentials rather than mean firing rates has been receiving increasing attention. The external sensory stimulation is first converted into spatiotemporal patterns using a latency-phase encoding method and subsequently transmitted to the consecutive network for learning. Spiking neurons are trained to reproduce target signals encoded with precisely timed spikes. We show that when a supervised spike-timing-based learning is used, different spatiotemporal patterns are recognized by different spike patterns with a high time precision in milliseconds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spike-Timing-Based Integrated Model for Pattern Recognition","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00395","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797167/06797487.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Spike-Timing-Based Integrated Model for Pattern Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spike-Timing-Based Integrated Model for Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054763S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6797167","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"25","articleId":"6797487","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797504,"authors":[{"name":"Todd K.

In intuitive terms, this is a passivity condition: a network having this property, when driven by an input signal, will become entrained by the input and develop an internal response signal. This excited internal dynamics can be seen as a high-dimensional, nonlinear, unique transform of the input with a rich memory content. This view has implications for understanding neural dynamics beyond the field of reservoir computing. Available definitions and theorems concerning the echo state property, however, are of little practical use because they do not relate the network response to temporal or statistical properties of the driving input. Here we present a new definition of the echo state property that directly connects it to such properties. We derive a fundamental 0-1 law: if the input comes from an ergodic source, the network response has the echo state property with probability one or zero, independent of the given network. Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the echo state property that connects statistical characteristics of the input to algebraic properties of the network connection matrix. The mathematical methods that we employ are freshly imported from the young field of nonautonomous dynamical systems theory. Since these methods are not yet well known in neural computation research, we introduce them in some detail. As a side story, we hope to demonstrate the eminent usefulness of these methods.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00411","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797179/06797527.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"696","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Echo State Property Linked to an Input: Exploring a Fundamental Characteristic of Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Echo State Property Linked to an Input: Exploring a Fundamental Characteristic of Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Echo State Property Linked to an Input: Exploring a Fundamental Characteristic of Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022163S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6797179","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6797527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6797562,"authors":[{"name":"Naimin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Information Science, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, 325035, PR China naiminzhang@yahoo.com.cn"],"firstName":"Naimin","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797562","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797562","abstract":"Two steepest-descent algorithms with momentum for quadratic functions are considered.

Introduction of newer prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom controlled by various neural commands will make such training even more difficult. To produce smooth and human-like movements, the user must learn to produce multiple neural commands with precise amplitude and timing. To aid in training of the amputee users, we have developed a realistic and motivating virtual environment (VE) consisting of a physics-based target shooting game. The users' neural commands such as EMG, cortical neural activity, or voluntary movements of the residual limbs can be used to control the movement of a simulated prosthesis to point and shoot at virtual targets. In addition to the visual, sound, and performance feedback of the resulting movement, the game provides reaction forces in contact points that can be used to drive haptic displays. The timing measurements show that the physics-based simulation and rendering can be executed in real time in readily available PC systems. The target shooting game was developed in musculoskeletal modeling software (MSMS) that has been developed in our laboratory and is freely available for development of similar virtual training applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/PRES_a_00091","publicationTitle":"Presence","displayPublicationTitle":"Presence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720227/6797249/06797570.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"95","doi":"10.1162/PRES_a_00091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Physics-Based Target Shooting Game to Train Amputee Users of Multijoint Upper Limb Prostheses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Physics-Based Target Shooting Game to Train Amputee Users of Multijoint Upper Limb Prostheses","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Physics-Based Target Shooting Game to Train Amputee Users of Multijoint Upper Limb Prostheses","sourcePdf":"pres_a_00091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024331S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","isNumber":"6797249","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720227","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6797570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6797572,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitriy Shutin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, U.S.A. dshutin@princeton.edu"],"firstName":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Shutin"},{"name":"Christoph Zechner","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 8092 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland zechner@control.ee.ethz.ch"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Zechner"},{"name":"Sanjeev R.

The variational approach allows for a seamless combination of sparse Bayesian learning ideas and a variational Bayesian space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (VB-SAGE) algorithm for estimating parameters of superimposed signals. While the former method realizes automatic regularization of ESNs, which also determines which echo states and input signals are relevant for \u201cexplaining\u201d the desired signal, the latter method provides a basis for joint estimation of D&S readout parameters. The proposed training algorithm can naturally be extended to ESNs with fixed filter neurons. It also generalizes the recently proposed expectation-maximization-based D&S readout adaptation method.

Physics-based modeling of deformable objects, especially when large nonlinear deformations and complex nonlinear material properties are involved, at these very high rates is one of the most challenging tasks in the development of real-time simulation systems. While some specialized solutions exist, there is no general solution for arbitrary nonlinearities. In this work we present PhyNNeSS\u2014a Physics-driven Neural Networks-based Simulation System\u2014to address this long-standing technical challenge. The first step is an offline precomputation step in which a database is generated by applying carefully prescribed displacements to each node of the finite element models of the deformable objects. In the next step, the data is condensed into a set of coefficients describing neurons of a Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). During real-time computation, these neural networks are used to reconstruct the deformation fields as well as the interaction forces. We present realistic simulation examples from interactive surgical simulation with real-time force feedback. As an example, we have developed a deformable human stomach model and a Penrose drain model used in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) training tool box. A unique computational modeling system has been developed that is capable of simulating the response of nonlinear deformable objects in real time. The method distinguishes itself from previous efforts in that a systematic physics-based precomputational step allows training of neural networks which may be used in real-time simulations. We show, through careful error analysis, that the scheme is scalable, with the accuracy being controlled by the number of neurons used in the simulation. PhyNNeSS has been integrated into SoFMIS (Software Framework for Multimodal Interactive Simulation) for general use.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug. 1 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Physics-Driven Neural Networks-Based Simulation System (PhyNNeSS) for Multimodal Interactive Virtual Environments Involving Nonlinear Deformable Objects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Physics-Driven Neural Networks-Based Simulation System (PhyNNeSS) for Multimodal Interactive Virtual Environments Involving Nonlinear Deformable Objects","sourcePdf":"pres_a_00054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021556S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2011","isNumber":"6797334","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720227","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6797575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797578,"authors":[{"name":"Marifi G\u00fcler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta, via Mersin-10, Turkey marifi.guler@gmail.com"],"firstName":"Marifi","lastName":"G\u00fcler"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797578","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"The excitability of cells is facilitated by voltage-gated ion channels.

There, it was found that a nontrivially persistent correlation takes place between the transmembrane voltage fluctuations (also between the fluctuations in the gating variables) and the component of open channel fluctuations attributed to the gate multiplicity. This nontrivial phenomenon was found to be playing a major augmentative role for the elevation of excitability and spontaneous firing in small cells.

Echo state network (ESN) is one of the simplest, yet powerful, reservoir models. ESN models are generally constructed in a randomized manner. In our previous study (Rodan & Ti\u0148o, \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2011</xref>\n), we showed that a very simple, cyclic, deterministically generated reservoir can yield performance competitive with standard ESN. In this contribution, we extend our previous study in three aspects. First, we introduce a novel simple deterministic reservoir model, cycle reservoir with jumps (CRJ), with highly constrained weight values, that has superior performance to standard ESN on a variety of temporal tasks of different origin and characteristics. Second, we elaborate on the possible link between reservoir characterizations, such as eigenvalue distribution of the reservoir matrix or pseudo-Lyapunov exponent of the input-driven reservoir dynamics, and the model performance. It has been suggested that a uniform coverage of the unit disk by such eigenvalues can lead to superior model performance. We show that despite highly constrained eigenvalue distribution, CRJ consistently outperforms ESN (which has much more uniform eigenvalue coverage of the unit disk). Also, unlike in the case of ESN, pseudo-Lyapunov exponents of the selected optimal CRJ models are consistently negative. Third, we present a new framework for determining the short-term memory capacity of linear reservoir models to a high degree of precision. Using the framework, we study the effect of shortcut connections in the CRJ reservoir topology on its memory capacity.","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00297","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797202/06797579.pdf","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Deterministically Constructed Cycle Reservoirs with Regular Jumps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"Simple Deterministically Constructed Cycle Reservoirs with Regular Jumps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797579/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Deterministically Constructed Cycle Reservoirs with Regular Jumps","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028761S","chronDate":"July  2012","isNumber":"6797202","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6797579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6797581,"authors":[{"name":"David Sussillo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-9505, U.S.A. sussillo@stanford.edu"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Sussillo"},{"name":"Omri Barak","affiliation":["Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032-2695, U.S.A. omri.barak@gmail.com"],"firstName":"Omri","lastName":"Barak"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797581","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"abstract":"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are useful tools for learning nonlinear relationships between time-varying inputs and outputs with complex temporal dependencies. Recently developed algorithms have been successful at training RNNs to perform a wide variety of tasks, but the resulting networks have been treated as black boxes: their mechanism of operation remains unknown. Here we explore the hypothesis that fixed points, both stable and unstable, and the linearized dynamics around them, can reveal crucial aspects of how RNNs implement their computations. Further, we explore the utility of linearization in areas of phase space that are not true fixed points but merely points of very slow movement. We present a simple optimization technique that is applied to trained RNNs to find the fixed and slow points of their dynamics. Linearization around these slow regions can be used to explore, or reverse-engineer, the behavior of the RNN. We describe the technique, illustrate it using simple examples, and finally showcase it on three high-dimensional RNN examples: a 3-bit flip-flop device, an input-dependent sine wave generator, and a two-point moving average. In all cases, the mechanisms of trained networks could be inferred from the sets of fixed and slow points and the linearized dynamics around them.","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797179/06797581.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"649","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opening the Black Box: Low-Dimensional Dynamics in High-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Opening the Black Box: Low-Dimensional Dynamics in High-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opening the Black Box: Low-Dimensional Dynamics in High-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018692S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6797179","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6797581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797586,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As the machine learning algorithms are inspired by the principles of human learning, one needs to incorporate the concept of metacognition to develop efficient machine learning algorithms. In this letter we present a metacognitive learning framework that controls the learning process of a fully complex-valued radial basis function network and is referred to as a metacognitive fully complex-valued radial basis function (Mc-FCRBF) network. Mc-FCRBF has two components: a cognitive component containing the FC-RBF network and a metacognitive component, which regulates the learning process of FC-RBF. In every epoch, when a sample is presented to Mc-FCRBF, the metacognitive component decides what to learn, when to learn, and how to learn based on the knowledge acquired by the FC-RBF network and the new information contained in the sample. The Mc-FCRBF learning algorithm is described in detail, and both its approximation and classification abilities are evaluated using a set of benchmark and practical problems. Performance results indicate the superior approximation and classification performance of Mc-FCRBF compared to existing methods in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Metacognitive Learning in a Fully Complex-Valued Radial Basis Function Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metacognitive Learning in a Fully Complex-Valued Radial Basis Function Neural Network","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025356S","chronDate":"May  2012","isNumber":"6797206","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"43","articleId":"6797586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797594,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Fairbank","affiliation":["Department of Computing, School of Informatics, City University London, London EC1V 0HB, U.K. michael.fairbank1@city.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Fairbank"},{"name":"Eduardo Alonso","affiliation":["Department of Computing, School of Informatics, City University London, London EC1V 0HB, U.K. E.Alonso@city.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Alonso"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797594","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797594","abstract":"The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm is a popular algorithm for training neural networks; however, for large neural networks, it becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of running time and memory requirements.

This is achieved by using a brain-computer interface (BCI) that transforms thought-modulated electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings into a control signal. A BCI establishes a communication channel between the human brain and the computer. The basic principle of the Graz-BCI is the detection and classification of motor-imagery-related EEG patterns, whereby the dynamics of sensorimotor rhythms are analyzed. A BCI is a closed-loop system and information is visually fed back to the user about the success or failure of an intended movement imagination. Feedback can be realized in different ways, from a simple moving bar graph to navigation in VEs. The goals of this work are twofold: first, to show the influence of different feedback types on the same task, and second, to demonstrate that it is possible to move through a VE (e.g., a virtual street) without any muscular activity, using only the imagination of foot movement. In the presented work, data from BCI feedback displayed on a conventional monitor are compared with data from BCI feedback in VE experiments with a head-mounted display (HMD) and in a high immersive projection environment (Cave). Results of three participants are reported to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. The data indicate that the type of feedback has an influence on the task performance, but not on the BCI classification accuracy. The participants achieved their best performances viewing feedback in the Cave. Furthermore the VE feedback provided motivation for the subjects.","displayPublicationTitle":"Presence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720227/6797225/06797606.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"514","publicationTitle":"Presence","doi":"10.1162/pres.15.5.500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/pres.15.5.500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Walking by Thinking: The Brainwaves Are Crucial, Not the Muscles!","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Walking by Thinking: The Brainwaves Are Crucial, Not the Muscles!","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Walking by Thinking: The Brainwaves Are Crucial, Not the Muscles!","sourcePdf":"pres155500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026841S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2006","isNumber":"6797225","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720227","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6797606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797642,"authors":[{"name":"Cesar F.

Many algorithms have been developed to find such representations for one-dimensional signals (vectors), which requires finding the sparsest solution of an underdetermined linear system of algebraic equations. In this letter, we generalize the theory of sparse representations of vectors to multiway arrays (tensors)\u2014signals with a multidimensional structure\u2014by using the Tucker model. Thus, the problem is reduced to solving a large-scale underdetermined linear system of equations possessing a Kronecker structure, for which we have developed a greedy algorithm, Kronecker-OMP, as a generalization of the classical orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for vectors. We also introduce the concept of multiway block-sparse representation of \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>N</i></b>\n-way arrays and develop a new greedy algorithm that exploits not only the Kronecker structure but also block sparsity. This allows us to derive a very fast and memory-efficient algorithm called N-BOMP (\n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>N</i></b>\n-way block OMP). We theoretically demonstrate that under the block-sparsity assumption, our N-BOMP algorithm not only has a considerably lower complexity but is also more precise than the classic OMP algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms can be used for very large-scale problems, which are intractable using standard approaches. We provide several simulations illustrating our results and comparing our algorithms to classical algorithms such as OMP and BP (basis pursuit) algorithms.

In particular, there is strong experimental evidence that interspike intervals (ISIs) are used for stimulus representation in neural systems. However, very few algorithmic principles exploit the benefits of such temporal codes for probabilistic inference of stimuli or decisions. Here, we describe and rigorously prove the functional properties of a spike-based processor that uses ISI distributions to perform probabilistic inference. The abstract processor architecture serves as a building block for more concrete, neural implementations of the belief-propagation (BP) algorithm in arbitrary graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks and factor graphs). The distributed nature of graphical models matches well with the architectural and functional constraints imposed by biology. In our model, ISI distributions represent the BP messages exchanged between factor nodes, leading to the interpretation of a single spike as a random sample that follows such a distribution. We verify the abstract processor model by numerical simulation in full graphs, and demonstrate that it can be applied even in the presence of analog variables. As a particular example, we also show results of a concrete, neural implementation of the processor, although in principle our approach is more flexible and allows different neurobiological interpretations. Furthermore, electrophysiological data from area LIP during behavioral experiments are assessed in light of ISI coding, leading to concrete testable, quantitative predictions and a more accurate description of these data compared to hitherto existing models.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797699","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797264/06797699.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00477","startPage":"2303","endPage":"2354","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spike-Based Probabilistic Inference in Analog Graphical Models Using Interspike-Interval Coding","volume":"25","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spike-Based Probabilistic Inference in Analog Graphical Models Using Interspike-Interval Coding","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021759S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"6797264","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6797699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6797722,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory F Welch","affiliation":["The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of Computer Science, CB 3175, Sitterson Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27510-3175"],"firstName":"Gregory F","lastName":"Welch"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1054-7460"}],"articleNumber":"6797722","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797722","abstract":"In 1960 Rudolph E.

(difference of convex functions) programs as a sequence of convex programs. In machine learning, CCCP is extensively used in many learning algorithms, including sparse support vector machines (SVMs), transductive SVMs, and sparse principal component analysis. Though CCCP is widely used in many applications, its convergence behavior has not gotten a lot of specific attention. Yuille and Rangarajan analyzed its convergence in their original paper; however, we believe the analysis is not complete. The convergence of CCCP can be derived from the convergence of the d.c. algorithm (DCA), proposed in the global optimization literature to solve general d.c. programs, whose proof relies on d.c. duality. In this note, we follow a different reasoning and show how Zangwill's global convergence theory of iterative algorithms provides a natural framework to prove the convergence of CCCP. This underlines Zangwill's theory as a powerful and general framework to deal with the convergence issues of iterative algorithms, after also being used to prove the convergence of algorithms like expectation-maximization and generalized alternating minimization. In this note, we provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence of CCCP by addressing two questions: When does CCCP find a local minimum or a stationary point of the d.c. program under consideration? and when does the sequence generated by CCCP converge? We also present an open problem on the issue of local convergence of CCCP.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proof of Convergence of the Concave-Convex Procedure Using Zangwill's Theory","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00283","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/6797262/06797753.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Proof of Convergence of the Concave-Convex Procedure Using Zangwill's Theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proof of Convergence of the Concave-Convex Procedure Using Zangwill's Theory","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013171S","chronDate":"June  2012","isNumber":"6797262","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"22","articleId":"6797753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797758,"authors":[{"name":"Toby Lightheart","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide SA 5005, Australia toby.lightheart@adelaide.edu.au"],"firstName":"Toby","lastName":"Lightheart"},{"name":"Steven Grainger","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide SA 5005, Australia steven.grainger@adelaide.edu.au"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Grainger"},{"name":"Tien-Fu Lu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide SA 5005, Australia tien-fu.lu@adelaide.edu.au"],"firstName":"Tien-Fu","lastName":"Lu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"6797758","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spike-Timing-Dependent Construction","abstract":"Spike-timing-dependent construction (STDC) is the production of new spiking neurons and connections in a simulated neural network in response to neuron activity. Following the discovery of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), significant effort has gone into the modeling and simulation of adaptation in spiking neural networks (SNNs). Limitations in computational power imposed by network topology, however, constrain learning capabilities through connection weight modification alone. Constructive algorithms produce new neurons and connections, allowing automatic structural responses for applications of unknown complexity and nonstationary solutions. A conceptual analogy is developed and extended to theoretical conditions for modeling synaptic plasticity as network construction. Generalizing past constructive algorithms, we propose a framework for the design of novel constructive SNNs and demonstrate its application in the development of simulations for the validation of developed theory.

The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.","doi":"10.1162/PRES_a_00124","publicationTitle":"Presence","displayPublicationTitle":"Presence","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720227/6797429/06797786.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/PRES_a_00124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797786/","displayDocTitle":"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality","sourcePdf":"pres_a_00124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018767S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","isNumber":"6797429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720227","citationCount":"99","articleId":"6797786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6797856,"authors":[{"name":"Wolfgang Maass","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Computer Science, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6807530/6797856/maass-2310593-small.gif","p":["\nWolfgang Maass received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from\nthe Ludwig-Maximilian-Universitaet, Munich, Germany, in 1974.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA; the University\nof Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; and the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.

This is a pity, since noise will be abundantly available in energy-efficient future nanoscale devices and circuits. I propose here to learn from the way the brain deals with noise, and apparently even benefits from it. Recent theoretical results have provided insight into how this can be achieved: how noise enables networks of spiking neurons to carry out probabilistic inference through sampling and also enables creative problem solving. In addition, noise supports the self-organization of networks of spiking neurons, and learning from rewards. I will sketch here the main ideas and some consequences of these results. I will also describe why these results are paving the way for a qualitative jump in the computational capability and learning performance of neuromorphic networks of spiking neurons with noise, and for other future computing systems that are able to treat noise as a resource.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6797856/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14267026","volume":"102","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise as a Resource for Computation and Learning in Networks of Spiking Neurons","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union project # FP7-604102 (Human Brain Project)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise as a Resource for Computation and Learning in Networks of Spiking Neurons","sourcePdf":"jproc-maass-2310593-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115509S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6807530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6807530","articleId":"6797856","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6797860,"authors":[{"name":"Jalil Seifali Harsini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6839072/6797860/seifa-2317186-small.gif","p":["\nJalil Seifali Harsini received the B.S. degree from the University of\nTabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 1994 and the M.S. degree from Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, in 1997, both in\nelectrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Tehran,\nTehran, Iran, in 2010, while he was a visiting scholar at the Department of Information Engineering, University of\nPadova, Italy during 2009.

We propose cognitive transmission strategies which provision for minimum primary quality of service (QoS) requirements. The proposed strategies take advantage of opportunities that arise during ARQ retransmissions of the primary system at the link layer, and adapt channel fading variations by employing adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and power control at the physical layer. In this cross-layer formulation, the cognitive throughput is optimized subject to 1) a packet-loss-rate (PLR) constraint on the cognitive link, and 2) a minimum required throughput and a PLR constraint on the primary link. We first derive analytical expressions for the link-layer throughput of the cognitive link defined in terms of the data rate successfully received at the receiver side. Next, we present optimized AMC and power control schemes for the cognitive transmitter. Numerical results show significant improvement in terms of the cognitive throughput and PLR performance. Namely, when the cognitive transmitter employs both power and rate control the throughput-maximizing strategy is determined based on a tradeoff between the primary PLR and delay (in terms of the number of retransmission rounds) QoS metrics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2317186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6839072","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1802","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6839072/06797860.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Strategy Design in Cognitive Radio Systems With Primary ARQ Control and QoS Provisioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797860/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Transmission Strategy Design in Cognitive Radio Systems With Primary ARQ Control and QoS Provisioning","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14396146","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-11-1-0538"},{"fundingName":"CaRiPaRo Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Strategy Design in Cognitive Radio Systems With Primary ARQ Control and QoS Provisioning","sourcePdf":"tcomm-seifaliharsini-2317186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090685S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6839072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6839072","articleId":"6797860","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6797863,"authors":[{"name":"Fengxiang Wang","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6898054/6797863/wang-2317140-small.gif","p":["\nFengxiang Wang was born in Jiujiang, China, in 1982.

By doing this, the interference can be better aligned to the symbols of interest, thus reducing the power required to cancel it. The scaling is performed by forming a constrained optimization problem, solved with existing well-known techniques, which entails an increase in the computational complexity at the base station. To quantify this trade-off in performance and complexity, a study of the impact in the signal processing load is carried out by means of a power efficiency analysis. The presented analytical and simulation results in this paper confirm that the proposed technique increases the power efficiency up to 100% with respect to previous THP-based approaches while, at the same time, maintaining the same average performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2317189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6839072","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6839072/06797864.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for the Downlink of Multi-User MISO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797864/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for the Downlink of Multi-User MISO Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14415112","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering, U.K."}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Power-Efficient Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for the Downlink of Multi-User MISO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-garciarodriguez-2317189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123271S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6839072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6839072","articleId":"6797864","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6797865,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsoo Lee","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

Typical write schemes using voltage sources aggravate write time/energy due to the source degeneration of the access transistor and high sensitivity to the process variations. In this paper, we propose a new write technique that uses \u201ccurrent sources\u201d to mitigate the impact of process variations on the switching performance compared to \u201cvoltage sources.\u201d Using current sources for write, we determine the optimal biasing conditions that minimize write energy or write energy-delay product (EDP).

Writing an entire word in a memory array involves certain bit-cells being written \u201c1\u201d (\u201c0\u201d\u2192\u201c1\u201d) and other bit-cells written \u201c0\u201d (\u201c1\u201d\u2192\u201c0\u201d), if redundant writes (\u201c0\u201d\u2192\u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d\u2192\u201c1\u201d) are ignored. As the first step of write, the bit-cells that require \u201c0\u201d to be written are suitably biased for low energy or low EDP, while the bit-cells requiring \u201c0\u201d\u2192\u201c1\u201d transition are turned OFF (i.e., don't care bit-cells during step 1). In step 2, the bit-cells requiring \u201c1\u201d to be written are biased for low energy or low EDP (cells requiring \u201c1\u201d\u2192\u201c0\u201d transition are don't care bit-cells during step 2).

Existing approximate adder designs have shown substantial advantages in improving many of these operational features. However, the error characteristics of the approximate adders still remain an issue that is not very well understood. A simulation-based method requires both programming efforts and a time-consuming execution for evaluating the effect of errors. This method becomes particularly expensive when dealing with various sizes and types of approximate adders. In this paper, a framework based on analytical models is proposed for evaluating the error characteristics of approximate adders. Error features such as the error rate and the mean error distance are obtained using this framework without developing functional models of the approximate adders for time-consuming simulation. As an example, the estimate of peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs) in image processing is considered to show the potential application of the proposed analysis. This analytical framework provides an efficient method to evaluate various designs of approximate adders for meeting different figures of merit in error-tolerant applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2015","volume":"64","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15035415","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2015","publicationDate":"1 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6797866/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Framework for Evaluating the Error Characteristics of Approximate Adders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Framework for Evaluating the Error Characteristics of Approximate Adders","sourcePdf":"tc-lombardi-2317180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126325S","chronDate":"May 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7079452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7079452","articleId":"6797866","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6797871,"authors":[{"name":"Spyridon V.

To match variable flow rate requirements due to changes in the vessel's operational profile with respect to plant limitations, real-time process measurements are used as feedback signals to adjust the parameters and set-points of a data-driven process controller with self-tuned proportional-integral-differential control loops, which is realized through a commercial programmable logic controller and regulates the speed of sea water cooling pumps in order to maximize power saving potential during sea-going and cargo unloading periods. Data-driven control establishes system dynamics according to process parameter variation and ensures system reliability through parameter monitoring, regardless of the controlled plant model. The plant power saving potential is initially examined through a practical case study, whereas experimental results provided after the proposed control system retrofit installation onboard a tanker vessel show significant power balance improvement and reduction of diesel generator fuel consumption compared to existing pump throttle control methods, verifying that marine industry can be greatly benefited from this energy efficiency upgrade.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797871/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14819940","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Process Controller for Energy-Efficient Variable-Speed Pump Operation in the Central Cooling Water System of Marine Vessels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Thenamaris Ships Management, Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Process Controller for Energy-Efficient Variable-Speed Pump Operation in the Central Cooling Water System of Marine Vessels","sourcePdf":"tie-giannoutsos-2317456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096971S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6994311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6994311","articleId":"6797871","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6797872,"authors":[{"name":"Myriam Munezero","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, PL 111, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/6866964/6797872/munez-small.gif","p":["Myriam D.

The proposed generalized cavity method is not limited to test specimens of smaller electrical dimensions, and requires two basic steps. The first step modifies the conventional cavity perturbation technique, where the effects of possible air gap between the cavity slot and the test specimen are also considered. The second step of the proposed approach employs a numerical optimization scheme, where the actual 3-D geometry of the fabricated cavity is simulated using the numerical field simulator, the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio. The dielectric properties of the test specimen in this case are determined with the help of a MATLAB-based optimization routine, which calls the CST modules over the component object model interface and minimizes the error between the measured and the simulated scattering coefficients. The permittivity of the test specimen determined using the first step is provided as the initial guess to improve the convergence of the numerical optimization scheme. The proposed unified approach is validated by designing two rectangular cavities having different slot sizes operating in the TE107 mode. A number of standard dielectric samples are measured with the help of a vector network analyzer, and a very good agreement is observed between the measured permittivity values and the published data available in the literature having a typical error of less than 2% for samples of even larger dimensions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2313415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6917240/06797881.pdf","startPage":"2632","endPage":"2641","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2313415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Rectangular Cavity Approach for Determination of Complex Permittivity of Materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Rectangular Cavity Approach for Determination of Complex Permittivity of Materials","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6797881/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14663563","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Rectangular Cavity Approach for Determination of Complex Permittivity of Materials","sourcePdf":"tim-jha-2313415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108028S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6917240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6917240","articleId":"6797881","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6797882,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwoo Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Jinwoo Shin received his B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from Seoul National University in 2001 and his Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010.

The Bethe approximation and the BP algorithm are heuristic methods for estimating the partition function and marginal probabilities in graphical models, respectively. The computational complexity of the Bethe approximation is decided by the number of operations required to solve a set of nonlinear equations, the so-called Bethe equation. Although the BP algorithm was inspired and developed independently, Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss showed that the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following question to understand limitations and empirical successes of the Bethe and BP methods: is the Bethe equation computationally easy to solve? We present a message-passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in a polynomial number of operations for general binary graphical models of n variables, where the maximum degree in the underlying graph is O(logn). Equivalently, it finds a stationary point of the Bethe free energy function. Our algorithm can be used as an alternative to BP fixing its convergence issue and is the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed-point computation in such a large class of graphical models, whereas the approximate fixed-point computation is known to be polynomial parity arguments on directed graphs (PPAD-)hard in general. We believe that our technique is of broader interest to understand the computational complexity of the cavity method in statistical physics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797882/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","volume":"60","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14379336","publicationDate":"July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797882/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Complexity of Approximating a Bethe Equilibrium","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Complexity of Approximating a Bethe Equilibrium","sourcePdf":"tit-shin-2317487-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080785S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6832684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6832684","articleId":"6797882","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6797884,"authors":[{"name":"Biswa Sengupta","affiliation":["The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6807530/6797884/sengu-2307755-small.gif","p":["\nBiswa Sengupta received the B.Eng.

Yet the overall power consumption is remarkably low, which has inspired engineers to mimic nervous systems in designing artificial cochlea, retinal implants, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to improve the quality of life in patients. Such neuromorphic devices are both energy efficient and increasingly able to emulate many functions of the human nervous system. We examine the energy constraints of neuronal signaling within biology, review the quantitative tradeoff between energy use and information processing, and ask whether the biophysics and design of nerve cells minimizes energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2014.2307755","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/6807530/06797884.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2307755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6807530","startPage":"738","endPage":"750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Consumption During Neuronal Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797884","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Consumption During Neuronal Computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"102","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267031","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797884/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Wellcome Trust/DBT Early Career fellowship"},{"fundingName":"European Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"},{"fundingName":"European Molecular Biology Organization"},{"fundingName":"Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-AC05-00OR22725"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Consumption During Neuronal Computation","sourcePdf":"jproc-stemmler-2307755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115108S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6807530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6807530","articleId":"6797884","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6797889,"authors":[{"name":"Ilya L.

Wideband radio channel results show that the signal delay spread is small enough, so 32 MHz satellite transponders could be used with no need of equalization. We also observed two important propagation impairments on the received signal envelope, both of them caused by the main rotor blades. The first one is the power attenuation produced when the LoS is obstructed by the blades. We demonstrate that this effect could be mitigated by using spatial or polarization diversity technique in the receiver end. The second one is the presence of multipath propagation leading to a power level oscillation dependent on the amplitude of the received multipath components. An UTD-based 3-D ray tracing model was used to conclude that the main multipath components are generated by diffraction on the rotor blade edges.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement, Characterization, and Modeling of the Helicopter Satellite Communication Radio Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2317483","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6847755/06797897.pdf","startPage":"3776","endPage":"3785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2317483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6847755","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Measurement, Characterization, and Modeling of the Helicopter Satellite Communication Radio Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6797897/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429530","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement, Characterization, and Modeling of the Helicopter Satellite Communication Radio Channel","sourcePdf":"tap-garciasanchez-2317483-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051866S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6847755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6847755","articleId":"6797897","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6797906,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Chaoming Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiayi University, Chiayi City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/6866941/6797906/hsu-2316518-small.gif","p":["ROY CHAOMING HSU (S\u201993\u2013M\u201901) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA, and the M.S. degree in engineering management from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1991, 1995, and 2001, respectively.

The RLTDPM monitors the environmental state of the EHWS and adjusts their operational duty cycle under criteria of energy neutrality to meet the demanded throughput. Outcomes of these observation-adjustment interactions are then evaluated by feedback/reward that represents how well the ToD requests are met; subsequently, the observation-adjustment-evaluation process, so-called reinforcement learning, continues. After the learning process, the RLTDPM is able to autonomously adjust the duty cycle for satisfying the ToD requirement, and in doing so, sustain the perpetual operation of the EHWSN. Simulations of the proposed RLTDPM on a wireless sensor node powered by a battery and solar cell for image sensing tasks were performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the achieved demanded throughput is improved 10.7% for the most stringent ToD requirement, while the residual battery energy of the RLTDPM is improved 7.4% compared with an existing DPM algorithm for EHWSN with image sensing purpose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","volume":"2","issue":"2","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"14485723","publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6797906/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Reinforcement Learning-Based ToD Provisioning Dynamic Power Management for Sustainable Operation of Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Node","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC-99-2221-E-415-013 and NSC-98-2221-E-415-011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Reinforcement Learning-Based ToD Provisioning Dynamic Power Management for Sustainable Operation of Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Node","sourcePdf":"tetc-hsu-2316518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080122S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"6866941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6866941","articleId":"6797906","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6797922,"authors":[{"name":"Shengquan Li","affiliation":["School of Hydraulic, Energy and Power Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6898054/6797922/sli-2317141-small.gif","p":["\nShengquan Li was born in Changde, China, in 1982.

One of the particularities of this paper lies in the fact that the CSI is distributed in the sense that each TX obtains its own estimate of the global multiuser MIMO channel with no further exchange of information being allowed between the TXs. Although this is well suited to model the cooperation between noncolocated TXs, e.g., in cellular coordinated multipoint schemes, this type of setting has received little attention so far in the information theoretic society. We study in this paper what are the CSI requirements at every TX, as a function of the network geometry, to ensure that the maximal number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) is achieved, i.e., the same DoF as obtained under perfect CSI at all TXs. We advocate the use of the generalized DoF to take into account the geometry of the network in the analysis. Consistent with the intuition, the derived generalized DoF maximizing CSI allocation policy suggests that TX cooperation should be limited to a specific finite neighborhood around each TX. This is in sharp contrast with the conventional (uniform) CSI dissemination policy, which induces CSI requirements that grow unbounded with the network size. The proposed CSI allocation policy suggests an alternative to clustering, which overcomes fundamental limitations, such as: 1) edge interference and 2) unbounded increase of the CSIT requirements with the cluster size. Finally, we show how finite neighborhood CSIT exchange translates into finite neighborhood message exchange so that finally global interference management is possible at finite SNR with only local cooperation.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2317179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6832684/06797930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2317179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832684","startPage":"4158","endPage":"4169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial CSIT Allocation Policies for Network MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial CSIT Allocation Policies for Network MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14379344","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797930/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial CSIT Allocation Policies for Network MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-dekerret-2317179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119807S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6832684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6832684","articleId":"6797930","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6797935,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Baingana","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engr., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6856242/6797935/6797935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brian Baingana (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota (UofM), Minneapolis, in 2013.

However, the so-termed adoption times when blogs mention popular news items, individuals in a community catch an infectious disease, or consumers adopt a trendy electronics product are typically known, and are implicitly dependent on the underlying network. To infer the network topology, a dynamic structural equation model is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times and the unknown edge weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights are estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted least-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are developed by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient iterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel algorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while accounting for external influences in the adoption times.

10 Gb/s with copper interconnect, the intersymbol interference (ISI) caused from the channel loss should be compensated. While a decision feedback equalizer (DFE), which is widely used in the receiver can compensate the ISI, its ability to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is limited especially for high frequency data patterns (alternating data patterns). Even a DFE with a large number of taps, which has powerful compensation capacity for ISI, can improve only limited amount of SNR. To improve SNR, this brief presents a 1/4th baud-rate continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a two-tap DFE. The 1/4th baud-rate CTLE recovers data to be adequate for the DFE, and remaining ISI is removed by the DFE. To boost the high frequency gain of the DFE, exclusive OR merged adders are introduced, so the proposed equalizer is more tolerant against channel noise. It compensates 21.7-dB channel loss and operates with 11.5-Gb/s data rate as it consumes 25.35 mW from 1.3 V supply in a 110-nm CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2314147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7046457/06797953.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2314147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7046457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 11.5 Gb/s 1/4th Baud-Rate CTLE and Two-Tap DFE With Boosted High Frequency Gain in 110-nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797953/","displayDocTitle":"An 11.5 Gb/s 1/4th Baud-Rate CTLE and Two-Tap DFE With Boosted High Frequency Gain in 110-nm CMOS","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14931629","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6797953/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the Ministry of Education, Science Technology, National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2009-0079097"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 11.5 Gb/s 1/4th Baud-Rate CTLE and Two-Tap DFE With Boosted High Frequency Gain in 110-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kim-2314147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049924S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7046457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7046457","articleId":"6797953","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6797960,"authors":[{"name":"Da Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Da Wang received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Shandong, Shandong, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, in 2014.","His research interests are in power system stability analysis and optimized control."]},"firstName":"Da","lastName":"Wang","id":"38239727600"},{"name":"Mevludin Glavic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Mevludin Glavic (SM'07) received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia, in 1997.","His affiliations include the University of Wisconsin- Madison as a Fulbright Postdoctoral Scholar, the University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, as a Senior Research Fellow and Visiting Professor, and Quanta Technology as a Senior Advisor.

These undesirable features can lead to energy loss and/or can necessitate a large reserve in the form of fast-ramping fuel-based generators. Energy storage can be used to mitigate these effects. In this paper, we are interested in the tradeoff between the use of the reserves and the energy loss. Energy loss includes energy that is either wasted, due to the inefficiency of the storage cycle and the inevitable forecasting errors, or lost when the storage capacity is insufficient. We base our analysis on an initial model proposed by Bejan, Gibbens, and Kelly. We first provide theoretical bounds on the trade-off between energy loss and the use of reserves. For a large storage capacity, we show that this bound is tight, and we develop an algorithm that computes the optimal schedule. Second, we develop a scheduling strategy that is efficient for small or moderate storage. We evaluate these policies on real data from the U.K. grid and show that they outperform existing heuristics. In addition, we provide guidelines for computing the optimal storage characteristics and the reserve size for a given penetration of wind in the energy mix.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2285395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6800037/06797967.pdf","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2285395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Generation and Storage Scheduling in the Presence of Renewable Forecast Uncertainties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Generation and Storage Scheduling in the Presence of Renewable Forecast Uncertainties","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239033","htmlLink":"/document/6797967/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Generation and Storage Scheduling in the Presence of Renewable Forecast Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tsg-gast-2285395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120573S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6800037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6800037","articleId":"6797967","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6797969,"authors":[{"name":"Shahzad Gishkori","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6850111/6797969/gishk-2317175-small.gif","p":["\nShahzad Gishkori (S'14) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical\nengineering from the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree\n(cum laude) in electrical engineering from the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2009.

The CS based detectors correspond to two communication scenarios. One, where the signaling is fully synchronized at the receiver and the other, where there exists a symbol level synchronization only. With the help of CS, the sampling rates are reduced much below the Nyquist rate to save on the high power consumed by the analog-to-digital converters. In stark contrast to the usual compressive sampling practices, the proposed detectors work on the compressed samples directly, thereby avoiding a complicated reconstruction step and resulting in a reduction of the implementation complexity. To resolve the detection of multiple symbols, compressed sphere decoders are proposed as well, for both communication scenarios, which can further help to reduce the system complexity. Differential detection directly on the compressed symbols is generally marred by the requirement of an identical measurement process for every received symbol. Our proposed detectors are valid for scenarios where the measurement process is the same as well as where it is different for each received symbol.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2317175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06797969.pdf","startPage":"3778","endPage":"3790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2317175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sampling-Based Multiple Symbol Differential Detection for UWB Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797969/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sampling-Based Multiple Symbol Differential Detection for UWB Communications","volume":"13","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430052","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6797969/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NWO-STW"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"318306"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sampling-Based Multiple Symbol Differential Detection for UWB Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-gishkori-2317175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128811S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6797969","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6797970,"authors":[{"name":"Gholamreza Nikandish","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6809863/6797970/6797970-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gholamreza Nikandish (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (with honors) from Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Sharif University of Technology.","His research interests include RF and microwave integrated circuits.","Mr. Nikandish was the recipient of the Second Place Award of the National Electrical Engineering Olympiad and the Third Place Award of the National Universities Exam for M.Sc.

The drain and gate bias lines are embedded in the HTNs to obviate the need for RF chokes and reduce the chip area. A single- and a dual-band MMIC PA are designed using the proposed technique and implemented in a 0.25- \u03bcm AlGaAs-InGaAs pHEMT technology. The single-band 5.5-GHz PA provides 27.5 dBm of output power with 70% power-added efficiency (PAE). This PAE level is achieved by terminating the first five harmonics at the output as well as the first three harmonics at the input of PA.

In our current work we examine the application of such approaches in soft-tissue simulation. The core idea is to split deformations into a coarse approximation and a differential part that contains the details. We employ the data-driven stamping approach to enrich a fast simulation surface with details that have been extracted from a set of example deformations obtained in offline computations. In this paper we detail our technique, and suggest further extensions over our previous work. First, we propose an improved method for correlating the current coarse approximation to the examples in the database. The new correlation metric combines Euclidean distances with cosine similarity. It allows for better example discrimination, resulting in a well-conditioned linear system. This also enables us to use a non-negative least squares solver that leads to a better regression and guarantees positive stamp blending weights. Second, we suggest a frequency-space stamp compression scheme that saves memory and, in most instances, is faster, since many operations can be done in the compressed space. Third, cutting is included by employing a physically-inspired influence map that allows for proper handling of material discontinuities that were not present in the original examples. We thoroughly evaluate our method and demonstrate its practical application in a surgical simulator prototype.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6797976/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2014","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14548007","pubMedId":"26357385","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Simulation of Detailed Surface Deformations for Surgery Training Simulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Simulation of Detailed Surface Deformations for Surgery Training Simulators","sourcePdf":"tvcg-seiler-2317192-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115214S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6881789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6881789","articleId":"6797976","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6797980,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Ye","affiliation":["McMaster Institute for Automotive Research and Technology, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6923502/6797980/ye-small.gif","p":["Jin Ye (S\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Two operational modes are defined for the online TSF during commutation: In Mode I, absolute value of rate of change of flux linkage (ARCFL) of incoming phase is higher than outgoing phase; in Mode II, ARCFL of outgoing phase is higher than incoming phase. In order to compensate the torque error produced by imperfect tracking of phase current, a proportional and integral compensator with torque error is added to the torque reference of outgoing phase in Mode I and incoming phase in Mode II. Therefore, the total torque is determined by the phase with lower ARCFL rather than the phase with higher ARCFL as in conventional TSFs. The maximum torque-ripple-free speed of the proposed TSF is increased to more than ten times as the best case in conventional TSFs. Finally, the proposed TSF is verified by both simulations and experiments with a 2.3 kW, 6000 rpm, three-phase 12/8 SRM operating in both linear magnetic and saturated magnetic regions. Results show that the proposed TSF has higher average torque, and much lower torque ripples compared to conventional TSFs.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2316272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2316272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6923502/06797980.pdf","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Extended-Speed Low-Ripple Torque Control of Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Extended-Speed Low-Ripple Torque Control of Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","volume":"30","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6797980/","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14665255","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6797980/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extended-Speed Low-Ripple Torque Control of Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-ye-2316272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096941S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6923502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"6923502","articleId":"6797980","onlineDate":"14 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6798048,"authors":[{"name":"Ansar Masood","affiliation":["Materials Science and Engineering Department, Materials Physics Engineering, The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ansar","lastName":"Masood","id":"37086631571"},{"name":"T.

protocol(TBQP) using meta-heuristic genetic algorithm for optimizing and securing MANET","abstract":"This paper includes a prospective approach of developing a trust based QOS protocol (TBQP) using meta-heuristic genetic algorithm for optimizing and securing MANET. Genetic algorithm will help in maintaining Quality of Service(QOS) by selecting a fittest i.e. shortest route hence providing better performance. Intelligent optimization approaches or meta heuristic algorithms like, genetic algorithm(GA), neural networks(NN) based on artificial intelligence(AI), particle swarm optimization(PSO) technique and simulated annealing(SA) in the recent years have well consigned QOS issues. Ad-hoc networks face the primary defiance of restraining attacks against data, like, unauthorized data modification impersonation etc caused by malicious nodes in the network. This problem is tackled by trust application in our proposed approach which helps in securing ad-hoc networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798315/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254567","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798315/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Trust based QOS protocol(TBQP) using meta-heuristic genetic algorithm for optimizing and securing MANET","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust based QOS protocol(TBQP) using meta-heuristic genetic algorithm for optimizing and securing MANET","confLoc":"Faridabad, India","sourcePdf":"S4P1173177ID25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046516S","chronDate":"6-8 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784149","isNumber":"6798279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784149","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6798279","articleId":"6798315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6798349,"authors":[{"name":"Ravinder Rathee","affiliation":["C R Polytechnic, Rohtak"],"firstName":"Ravinder","lastName":"Rathee","id":"37086686587"},{"name":"Anita Dagar","affiliation":["Research Scholar, Dravidian University, AP"],"firstName":"Anita","lastName":"Dagar","id":"37086683762"},{"name":"Seema Rani","affiliation":["Dept.of computer science &Engineering, MRIU, Faridabad"],"firstName":"Seema","lastName":"Rani","id":"37089144080"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2995-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3958-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2996-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6798349","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Routing","Neurons","Computer architecture","Optimization","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Computer bugs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised learning","neural network","ant colony optimization","SLNA algorithm","travel agency","path optimization","search space","ATSP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ant colony","supervised learning","SLNNA","Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798349","abstract":"To describe the approach of real-world activities we have proposed an idea of SLNA algorithm and its diagram.

The License Plate Recognition is broadly employed in traffic management to recognize a vehicle whose owner has despoiled traffic laws or to find stolen vehicles. Vehicle License Plate Detection and Recognition is a key technique in most of the traffic related applications such as searching of stolen vehicles, road traffic monitoring, airport gate monitoring, speed monitoring and automatic parking lots access control. It is simply the ability of automatically extract and recognition of the vehicle license number plate's character from a captured image. Number Plate Recognition method suffered from problem of feature selection process. The current method of number plate recognition system only focus on local, global and Neural Network process of Feature Extraction and process for detection. The Optimized Feature Selection process improves the detection ratio of number plate recognition. In this paper, it is proposed a new methodology for `License Plate Recognition' based on wavelet transform function. This proposed methodology compare with Correlation based method for detection of number plate. Empirical result shows that better performance in comparison of correlation based technique for number plate recognition. Here, it is modified the Matching Technique for numberplate recognition by using Multi-Class RBF Neural Network Optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ICROIT.2014.6798352","startPage":"347","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Reliability Optimization and Information Technology (ICROIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICROIT.2014.6798352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798279","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Reliability Optimization and Information Technology (ICROIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784149/6798279/06798352.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid technique for License Plate Recognition based on feature selection of wavelet transform and artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798352/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid technique for License Plate Recognition based on feature selection of wavelet transform and artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798352/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254476","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid technique for License Plate Recognition based on feature selection of wavelet transform and artificial neural network","confLoc":"Faridabad, India","sourcePdf":"S6P5347352ID45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057709S","chronDate":"6-8 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784149","isNumber":"6798279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784149","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6798279","articleId":"6798352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6798362,"authors":[{"name":"Harpreet Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amity School of Engineering & Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Harpreet","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086768358"},{"name":"Abha Sachdev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amity School of Engineering & Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Abha","lastName":"Sachdev","id":"37086766558"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2995-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3958-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2996-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6798362","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1060},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798362","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Cryptography","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","quantum computing","super-fast computers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Computing","Cloud Computing","Qubit","Quantum Cloud"]}],"abstract":"Quantum Computing and Cloud Computing are the technologies which have the capability to shape the future of computing.

Today, even critical infrastructure operators are considering moving their services and data to the cloud; most prominently are telecommunication operators, who are calling for running their service as so-called virtual network services. These services are usually composed from a set of components, each with individual resilience and scalability requirements. Hence, the problem of describing the blueprint of how to build a service from its components, including the components' requirements, and how to derive an actual deployment from such a blueprint needs to be solved. In this paper, we present a first step in this direction. We have developed an information model to describe the resources and components of complex composite services, and a management system that maps such a description into a deployment model. We have based our prototype on OpenStack and have identified some shortcomings of it that need to be overcome to make an automated resilience-aware deployment and operation system reality.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2013.6798428","publicationTitle":"2013 5th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784145/6798392/06798428.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2013.6798428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resilient deployment of virtual network functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798428/","displayDocTitle":"Resilient deployment of virtual network functions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254272","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798428/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilient deployment of virtual network functions","confLoc":"Almaty, Kazakhstan","sourcePdf":"p208scholler.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041484S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784145","isNumber":"6798392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784145","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6798392","articleId":"6798428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6798522,"authors":[{"name":"Nematollah Bidokhti","affiliation":["Cisco Systems"],"bio":{"p":["Nematollah Bidokhti is a Staff Engineer at Cisco Systems.

The focus is mostly on two component types ASICs and memories. The aging and failure mitigation techniques vary by component type. Design for reliability techniques so far have been focused on measuring the impact of failures and how to prevent them as much as possible. The current advances in DFR methodologies are reaching their maximum level of effectiveness, still ASIC and memory failures are occurring impacting service operation of many products in the industry. Today's technologies and their challenges require a different approach to addressing failures, which is the ability to have real time self-healing capability. The methodologies that have been developed in the area of self-healing have shown a promising future in the product overall fault management where failures due to aging ASICs and failing memories can be addressed while the system is in operation. This capability allows equipment providers to maintain their customer's confidence in their ability to design, develop and deliver robust products and allow continuous system operation in the presence of failures. In this paper, we discuss the fundamental and phenomenon of aging, modeling and simulation, correlation between simulation and actual devices, sensor designs, mitigation strategies, impact on system reliability and availability and the reliability prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798522/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798522/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14253807","conferenceDate":"27-30 Jan. 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Life after failure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Life after failure","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"14D4RM190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1111S","chronDate":"27-30 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6778477","isNumber":"6798433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6778477","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6798433","articleId":"6798522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6798637,"authors":[{"name":"Seth Earley","affiliation":["Earley & Associates"],"bio":{"p":["Seth Earley is CEO of Earley & Associates (www.earley.com).

Only if the organization transforms how it does business--using the same old approaches with new software aren't sufficient. The pace of collaboration, problem solving, innovation, and value creation has been increasing as new enabling tools emerge, resulting in a cycle in which innovation leads to new inventions. For example, the development of knowledge bases presented an innovative way to collaborate, which in turn lead to inventions in many fields. Some might assume that this process creates an advantage, but in reality, almost everyone else is developing these tools at the same time. New capabilities are evolving in the context of an ecosystem of competitors, all of whom are trying to do the same thing. The key is to leverage new tools and approaches faster than others in your industry, creating differentiated value for the customer.","doi":"10.1109/MITP.2014.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITP.2014.24","publicationTitle":"IT Professional","displayPublicationTitle":"IT Professional","pdfPath":"/iel7/6294/6798542/06798637.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Digital Transformation: Staying Competitive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"The Digital Transformation: Staying Competitive","volume":"16","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar.-Apr.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798637/","publicationDate":"Mar.-Apr. 2014","accessionNumber":"14251248","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798637/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Digital Transformation: Staying Competitive","sourcePdf":"mit2014020058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051522S","chronDate":"Mar.-Apr.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6294","isNumber":"6798542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6294","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6798542","articleId":"6798637","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6798652,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ming Zhu (S\u201911) received the bachelor's degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China, in 2010.

The synchronous clock distribution is achieved jointly with high-speed OFDMA data signal transmission through a simple and low-cost intensity-modulation direct-detection (IMDD) optical backhaul architecture that also guarantees clock time and frequency stability. We experimentally verify aggregate 41.09-Gb/s (7\u03bb \u00d7 5.87 Gb/s/\u03bb) DWDM-OFDMA data rates with distribution and recovery of 50-MHz square wave and 4-GHz sinusoid clocks over 40 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) with spectrally-efficient 25-GHz channel spacing and no remote optical amplification. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed system, aggregate 51.31-Gb/s (7\u03bb \u00d7 7.33 Gb/s/\u03bb) DWDM-OFDMA transmission with 50-MHz square wave and 5-GHz sine wave clocks is also experimentally evaluated. Highly precise time and frequency accuracy is achieved, featuring an order of magnitude improvement with respect to LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) synchronization requirements. By supporting high bit rates, high spectral efficiency, and low-latency synchronization, the proposed approach is promising for future optical MBH.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

The dynamic model of the hybrid maglev transportation system including levitated hybrid electromagnets to reduce the suspension power loss and the friction force during linear movement and a propulsive linear induction motor based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics is first constructed. The ultimate goal is to design an online fuzzy neural network (FNN) control methodology to cope with the problem of the complicated control transformation and the chattering control effort in backstepping control (BSC) design, and to directly ensure the stability of the controlled system without the requirement of strict constraints, detailed system information, and auxiliary compensated controllers despite the existence of uncertainties. In the proposed BFNNC scheme, an FNN control is utilized to be the major control role by imitating the BSC strategy, and adaptation laws for network parameters are derived in the sense of projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for the hybrid maglev transportation system is verified by experimental results, and the superiority of the BFNNC scheme is indicated in comparison with the BSC strategy and the backstepping particle-swarm-optimization control system in previous research.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2314718","startPage":"302","endPage":"317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2314718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7010866/06798656.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backstepping Fuzzy-Neural-Network Control Design for Hybrid Maglev Transportation System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798656/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Backstepping Fuzzy-Neural-Network Control Design for Hybrid Maglev Transportation System","volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6798656/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14854538","pubMedId":"25608292","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC-97-2221-E-155-065-MY2 and NSC-102-3113-P-155-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backstepping Fuzzy-Neural-Network Control Design for Hybrid Maglev Transportation System","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wai-2314718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115877S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7010866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7010866","articleId":"6798656","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6798658,"authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Gyongyosi","affiliation":["Quantum Technologies Laboratory, Department of Telecommunications, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"bio":{"p":["Laszlo Gyongyosi received the M.Sc.

On the other hand, there is no general rule for the behavior of quantum capacity for antidegradable quantum channels. We introduce the set of partially degradable (PD) quantum channels to answer the question of additivity of quantum capacity for a well-separable subset of antidegradable channels. A quantum channel is PD if the channel output can be used to simulate the degraded environment state. The PD channels could exist both in the degradable, antidegradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term partial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of the complementary channel of a PD channel. We prove that the quantum capacity of an arbitrary dimensional PD channel is additive. We also demonstrate that better quantum data rates can be achieved over a PD channel in comparison with standard (non-PD) channels. Our results indicate that the partial degradability property can be exploited and yet still hold many benefits for quantum communications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2317652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6705689/06798658.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"355","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2317652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Structure and Quantum Capacity of a Partially Degradable Quantum Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","displayDocTitle":"The Structure and Quantum Capacity of a Partially Degradable Quantum Channel","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6798658/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14279484","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research","grantNumber":"TAMOP-4.2.2.B-10/1-2010-0009"},{"fundingName":"COST Action","grantNumber":"MP1006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Structure and Quantum Capacity of a Partially Degradable Quantum Channel","sourcePdf":"access-gyongyosi-2317652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105263S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6705689","articleId":"6798658","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6798661,"authors":[{"name":"Hoi Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7063292/6798661/lee-2315158-small.gif","p":["Hoi Lee (M'05\u2013SM'09) received the B.Eng., M.Phil., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 1998, 2000, and 2004, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA, in 2005, where he is an Associate Professor.

An area-efficient power stage that can be configured to four different conversion ratios (2\u00d7/2.5\u00d7/3\u00d7/4\u00d7) under different input voltages, is proposed to maintain high power efficiencies and small output ripples of the regulator over a wide input voltage range caused by coupling variations. Instead of using a low-dropout regulator for post regulation, a fixed on-time regulation scheme is developed to provide output regulation and reduce the switching power loss under the light load condition. Implemented in a standard 0.35-\u03bcm n-well CMOS process, the proposed regulator delivers a maximum output current of 10 mA and achieves the peak power efficiency of 82%. When the input voltage varies by 1.6 V, the power efficiency of the proposed regulator can be improved by 40% compared with the regulator efficiency with a fixed-ratio 4\u00d7 power stage. The output ripple reaches 24 mV that is 0.5% of the output regulated voltage.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7063292/06798661.pdf","startPage":"712","endPage":"722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2315158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2315158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7063292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable -

Given the desired trajectories of human forearm positions, in the developed control, adaptive fuzzy approximators are used to estimate the dynamical uncertainties of the human-robot system, and an iterative learning scheme is utilized to compensate for unknown time-varying periodic disturbances. With the synthesis of the backstepping, iterative learning, and Lyapunov function approaches, the developed controller does not require exact knowledge of the exoskeleton model, and the close-loop system can be proven to be semiglobally uniformly bounded.

Dynamic capacity provisioning is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption by dynamically adjusting the number of active machines to match resource demands. However, despite extensive studies of the problem, existing solutions have not fully considered the heterogeneity of both workload and machine hardware found in production environments. In particular, production data centers often comprise heterogeneous machines with different capacities and energy consumption characteristics. Meanwhile, the production cloud workloads typically consist of diverse applications with different priorities, performance and resource requirements. Failure to consider the heterogeneity of both machines and workloads will lead to both sub-optimal energy-savings and long scheduling delays, due to incompatibility between workload requirements and the resources offered by the provisioned machines. To address this limitation, we present Harmony, a Heterogeneity-Aware dynamic capacity provisioning scheme for cloud data centers. Specifically, we first use the K-means clustering algorithm to divide workload into distinct task classes with similar characteristics in terms of resource and performance requirements. Then we present a technique that dynamically adjusting the number of machines to minimize total energy consumption and scheduling delay. Simulations using traces from a Google's compute cluster demonstrate Harmony can reduce energy by 28 percent compared to heterogeneity-oblivious solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Provisioning in the Cloud","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2014.2306427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/6804708/06798670.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2014.2306427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6804708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798670/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Provisioning in the Cloud","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6798670/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2014","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2014","accessionNumber":"14252118","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Provisioning in the Cloud","sourcePdf":"tcc-zhang-2306427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090685S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"6804708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6804708","articleId":"6798670","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6798673,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Mohammad Fouladgar","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research (CWCSPR), New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6839072/6798673/foula-2317480-small.gif","p":["\nAli Mohammad Fouladgar (S'14) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\nelectrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

The receiver's energy utilization requirements are modeled stochastically, and constraints are imposed on the probabilities of battery underflow and overflow at the receiver. It is demonstrated that the codewords' structure afforded by the use of constrained codes enables the transmission strategy to be better adjusted to the receiver's energy utilization pattern, as compared to classical unstructured codes.

The proposed scheme adjusts the unit and resolution of the feedback to efficiently exploit the long-term channel statistics, including the path loss, delay spread, and mobility. To develop an analytical optimization framework, we first derive the sum-rate of MISO-OFDMA systems when the channel-state information (CSI) at the transmitter is imperfect because of the quantization error, channel variation, and feedback delay. Based on the derived results, we present effective solutions to the sum-rate maximization problem for distributed and centralized scenarios. When the channel statistics of the users are not available at the base station, each user can improve the sum-rate of the system by minimizing the distortion on CSI feedback under a fixed per-user feedback rate. With the channel statistics of the users, the base station can further control the user set and the feedback rate in addition to the feedback granularity. We evaluate the performance of both distributed and centralized schemes over practical wireless environments, where each user has different long-term channel statistics. Simulation results show that both methods significantly improve the performance of MISO-OFDMA systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6874603/06798676.pdf","startPage":"4401","endPage":"4414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2317472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2317472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6874603","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback Optimization Schemes for Downlink MISO-OFDMA Systems With Heterogeneous Users","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency modulation","Delays","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optimisation","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback optimization schemes","downlink MISO-OFDMA systems","heterogeneous users","multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiple access systems","long-term channel statistics","delay spread","path loss","channel-state information","quantization error","channel variation","feedback delay","sum-rate maximization problem","CSI feedback","fixed per-user feedback rate","centralized schemes","distributed schemes"]},{"kwd":["Limited feedback","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)","correlated channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Feedback Optimization Schemes for Downlink MISO-OFDMA Systems With Heterogeneous Users","volume":"13","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6798676/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14513485","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program","grantNumber":"2011-0013807"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback Optimization Schemes for Downlink MISO-OFDMA Systems With Heterogeneous Users","sourcePdf":"twc-im-2317472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107602S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6874603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6874603","articleId":"6798676","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6798702,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Onic","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Onic","id":"37597709800"},{"name":"Mario Huemer","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Huemer","id":"37332452100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6798702","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":645},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Vectors","OFDM","Estimation","Interpolation","Decoding","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interpolation","OFDM modulation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise interpolation","unique word OFDM","unique word-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error ratio performance","cyclic prefixes","CP","Bayesian linear data estimators","nonlinear sphere decoding approach","SD approach","UW-OFDM reception","NI","data decisions","Wiener interpolation","sample selection policy","LMMSE data estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LMMSE estimation","noise interpolation","noise prediction","OFDM","sphere decoding","unique word"]}],"abstract":"Unique word-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) is known to feature an excellent bit error ratio performance when compared to conventional OFDM using cyclic prefixes (CP). In recent papers classical and Bayesian linear data estimators as well as the non-linear sphere decoding (SD) approach have been investigated in the UW-OFDM context. In general, the remaining error samples after a linear data estimation in UW-OFDM are correlated. In this work, noise interpolation (NI) is proposed, which uses preliminary data decisions together with Wiener interpolation to exploit these correlations. It turns out that the selection of samples to be used for NI is crucial. With the sample selection policy suggested in this work, NI clearly outperforms LMMSE data estimation, and due to its lower complexity compared to SD, it can be regarded as an attractive compromise for UW-OFDM reception.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Interpolation for Unique Word OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2317512","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6799218/06798702.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2317512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Noise Interpolation for Unique Word OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6798702/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14251263","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Noise Interpolation for Unique Word OFDM","sourcePdf":"lsp-onic-2317512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073342S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6799218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6799218","articleId":"6798702","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6798703,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Jiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6847755/6798703/6798703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mei Jiang (S'09) was born in Henan Province, China, in 1987.

analysis and design problems for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems to achieve time-varying formations are investigated. To achieve predefined time-varying formations, formation protocols are presented for UAV swarm systems first, where the velocities of UAVs can be different when achieving formations. Then, consensus-based approaches are applied to deal with the time-varying formation control problems for UAV swarm systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for UAV swarm systems to achieve time-varying formations are proposed. An explicit expression of the time-varying formation center function is derived. In addition, a procedure to design the protocol for UAV swarm systems to achieve time-varying formations is given. Finally, a quadrotor formation platform, which consists of five quadrotors is introduced. Theoretical results obtained in this brief are validated on the quardrotor formation platform, and outdoor experimental results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","volume":"23","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14818469","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6798711/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying Formation Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Theories and Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374034 and 61174067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying Formation Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Theories and Applications","sourcePdf":"tcst-dong-2314460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118905S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6985698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"426","xplore-issue":"6985698","articleId":"6798711","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6798721,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A workload refers to the application to be deployed in such an infrastructure. To take advantage of the SDE interface, the workload is described using a declarative workload definition language and is then deployed in the infrastructure through an automated workload orchestration and optimization layer. This paper describes the architecture and algorithms that make up this layer. Given a definition of the workload, including the virtual components of the application and their resource needs, as well as other meta-information relating to factors such as performance, availability, and privacy, the function of the workload orchestration and optimization layer is to map virtual resources to physical resources and realize such a mapping in the infrastructure. This mapping, known as placement, is optimized so that the infrastructure is efficiently utilized, and the workload requirements are satisfied. We present the overall architecture of the workload orchestration and optimization runtime. We focus on the workload placement problem and describe our optimization framework. Then, we consider a real application, IBM Connections, as a use-case to demonstrate the orchestration and optimization functionalities.","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2014.2304864","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel7/5288520/6818455/06798721.pdf","startPage":"11:1","endPage":"11:12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2014.2304864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6818455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Workload orchestration and optimization for software defined environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798721/","displayDocTitle":"Workload orchestration and optimization for software defined environments","volume":"58","issue":"2/3","publicationDate":"March-May 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798721/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workload orchestration and optimization for software defined environments","sourcePdf":"jrd-tantawi-2304864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060062S","chronDate":"March-May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"6818455","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6818455","articleId":"6798721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6798725,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, NJ, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"},{"name":"Shi Yan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications (Ministry of Education), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Yan","id":"37068642400"},{"name":"H.

In this letter, the single nearest and N-nearest RRH association strategies are presented, and the corresponding impact on the ergodic capacity of C-RANs is analyzed, where RRHs are distributed according to a stationary point process. Closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity of the proposed RRH association strategies are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived uplink closed-form capacity expressions are accurate. Furthermore, the analysis and simulation results show that the ergodic capacity gain is not linear with either the RRH density or the number of antennas per RRH. The ergodic capacity gain from the RRH density is larger than that from the number of antennas per RRH, which indicates that the association number of the RRH should not be bigger than 4 to balance the performance gain and the implementation cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798725/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14547901","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic Capacity Analysis of Remote Radio Head Associations in Cloud Radio Access Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61222103 and 61361166005"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001001"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic Capacity Analysis of Remote Radio Head Associations in Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"lwc-peng-2317476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052517S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6880865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6880865","articleId":"6798725","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6798727,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Ciocchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria and Italian Universities Nanoelectronics Team, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6817621/6798727/ciocc-2313889-small.gif","p":["Nicola Ciocchini (S'12) received the M.S.

This enables the easy creation and manipulation of software defined environments consisting of server, storage, network, software, and the supporting management functions. Model-based deployment and management technologies that are based on upcoming standards such as the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) allow for describing models of different kinds of workloads such as topology patterns and management plans. The term \u201cpattern\u201d refers to a description of components of a service, e.g., an application or infrastructure, and their relationships. This approach provides a flexible combination of declarative and imperative models of workloads that can be seamlessly integrated with automation frameworks such as Chef for task-level automation as well as management services to drive resource orchestration and optimization. In this paper, we explain how the aforementioned concepts are used as foundational elements of the software defined environment.

Therefore, not only can storage resources cross physical boundaries, but they can also be defined by software and provisioned automatically, for instance, by the applications that consume them. In this paper, we present a novel software defined cooperative caching (SDCC) framework that operates at the block layer and manages the placement of data in different tiers and caches that span multiple servers and storage systems in an integrated and coherent fashion. A programming interface complements the core framework by giving the applications an interface to control data organization across the storage, thereby allowing the block storage infrastructure to be software defined. The SDCC framework allows applications to actively influence the data layout while also benefitting from the system-wide knowledge and resource management capabilities of the storage system. We present an experimental study conducted using real workloads, and the results demonstrate the performance benefits gained with SDCC, as well as the potential for consolidating multiple different workloads that share the same storage server.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6818455","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel7/5288520/6818455/06798739.pdf","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2014.2303595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2014.2303595","startPage":"7:1","endPage":"7:13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software defined just-in-time caching in an enterprise storage system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798739/","displayDocTitle":"Software defined just-in-time caching in an enterprise storage system","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798739/","volume":"58","issue":"2/3","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","publicationDate":"March-May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software defined just-in-time caching in an enterprise storage system","sourcePdf":"jrd-haas-2303595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055795S","chronDate":"March-May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"6818455","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6818455","articleId":"6798739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IBM","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6798744,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Lu","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6895322/6798744/6798744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lu Lu (S'09) received her B.S.E degree and M.S.E degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

We particularly focus on the potential impact of pilot contamination caused by the use of non-orthogonal pilot sequences by users in adjacent cells. We also analyze the energy efficiency achieved by massive MIMO systems, and demonstrate how the degrees of freedom provided by massive MIMO systems enable efficient single-carrier transmission. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing massive MIMO in future wireless communications systems are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2317671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6895322/06798744.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2317671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of Massive MIMO: Benefits and Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Massive MIMO: Benefits and Challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798744/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14581807","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798744/","volume":"8","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Massive MIMO: Benefits and Challenges","sourcePdf":"jstsp-lu-2317671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.231067S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"1477","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6798744","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6798748,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The transmitter-side digital signal processing (DSP), including hard clipping and predistortion, is introduced to combat the penalty induced by the limited ER of the modulator and the quantization noise of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The DAC resolution needed for transmitters using modulators with various ER values are examined. The peak-to-peak driving voltage (Vpp) and the clipping ratio (CR) of the transmitted signals are also optimized with respect to minimizing the Q-factor penalty for the modulator with different ER values. The simulation results show that, unlike previous work using modulators with an infinite ER, the optimum Vpp and CR values vary with different ERs and modulation levels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of a CO-OFDM Transmitter With Limited Modulator Extinction Ratio","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2317676","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6809260/06798749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2317676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809260","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of a CO-OFDM Transmitter With Limited Modulator Extinction Ratio","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6798749/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7200207","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14267341","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61307090"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M531865"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design and Analysis of a CO-OFDM Transmitter With Limited Modulator Extinction Ratio","sourcePdf":"jphot-guo-2317676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055179S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6809260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6809260","articleId":"6798749","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6798751,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Vercesi","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Vercesi","id":"38366137200"},{"name":"Nicola Sambo","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Sambo","id":"37297451200"},{"name":"Mirco Scaffardi","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Photonic Networks, National Interuniversity Consortium for Telecommunications, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Mirco","lastName":"Scaffardi","id":"37270984700"},{"name":"Filippo Cugini","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Photonic Networks, National Interuniversity Consortium for Telecommunications, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Cugini","id":"37283195200"},{"name":"Antonella Bogoni","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Photonic Networks, National Interuniversity Consortium for Telecommunications, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonella","lastName":"Bogoni","id":"37270979100"},{"name":"Piero Castoldi","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Castoldi","id":"37085385380"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6798751","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Optical polarization","Nonlinear optics","Optical modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Optical noise","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","demultiplexing","differential phase shift keying","light polarisation","multiplexing","optical communication","quadrature phase shift keying","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blocking probability","routing strategy","spectrum utilization","optical demultiplexing","dual polarization differential quadrature phase shift keying","ON-OFF-keying tributaries","optical multiplexing architecture","DP-DQPSK traffic trunks","OOK streams","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","bit rate 20 Gbit/s","bit rate 40 Gbit/s"]},{"kwd":["Grooming","modulation format","WSON"]}],"abstract":"Two cost-effective implementations of optical multiplexing architecture are demonstrated.

The objective is to design a linear precoder to adapt to the degradation caused by the imperfect channel estimation at the receiver and the transmit-receive antenna correlation. The system is partially coherent so that the MIMO channel coefficients are estimated at the receiver and its error covariance matrix is fed back to the transmitter. We utilized the cutoff rate (CR) expression, an alternative to the mutual information (MI), and propose to use it as a design criterion to design the linear precoders. A linear precoder is obtained by numerically maximizing the CR with respect to the precoder matrix with a given average power constraint. Furthermore, the precoder matrix is decomposed using singular value decomposition (SVD) into the input shaping matrix, power loading matrix, and beamforming matrix. The beamforming matrix is found to coincide with the eigenvectors of the transmit correlation matrix. The power loading and input shaping matrices are solved numerically using the difference of convex (d.c.) functions programming algorithm and optimization under the unitary constraint, respectively. A 2-block alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to solve the input shaping matrix and power loading matrix iteratively. Precoders are designed to be used in conjunction with two MIMO transmission schemes: the spatial multiplexing (SM) and space-time (ST) block transmission modes. The frame error rate (FER) and average MI are used as the performance metrics to validate the performance of the newly designed CR-precoders in comparison with the conventional no-precoding case and cutoff rate optimized partially coherent constellations (PCCs). Numerical examples show that the performance gains of the designed precoders are significant compared to the CR-PCCs and conventional codewords.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoder Design for Doubly Correlated Partially Coherent Fading MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2317490","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06798756.pdf","startPage":"3621","endPage":"3635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2317490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoder Design for Doubly Correlated Partially Coherent Fading MIMO Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6798756/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430081","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes)"},{"fundingName":"Elektrobit"},{"fundingName":"Nokia"},{"fundingName":"Nokia Siemens Networks"},{"fundingName":"Xilinx"},{"fundingName":"Renesas Mobile Europe"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoder Design for Doubly Correlated Partially Coherent Fading MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-yadav-2317490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167209S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6798756","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6798758,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Wa Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6923502/6798758/tsang-small.gif","p":["Chi Wa Tsang received the M.Eng. degree in mechatronics from the\n University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2009.","Since 2009, he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering\n at the University of Sheffield.

Our goal is to design practical scheduling policies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput and delay, at a low complexity. While a class of O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.5</sup>\n log n)-complexity hybrid scheduling policies is recently developed to guarantee both rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting), their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop a simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a lower complexity 2n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n+2n, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves throughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay performance. Specifically, the rate-function of the delay-violation probability attained by D-SSG for any fixed integer delay threshold b > 0 is no smaller than the maximum achievable rate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold b-1. Thus, we are able to achieve a reduction in complexity (from O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.5</sup>\n logn) of the hybrid policies to 2n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n + 2n) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More importantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity than the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in the O(\u00b7) notation. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate our theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that in all scenarios we consider, D-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically has a similar delay performance to the rate-function delay-optimal policies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15201230","htmlLink":"/document/6798762/","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Optimal Throughput and Near-Optimal Asymptotic Delay Performance in Multichannel Wireless Networks With Low Complexity: A Practical Greedy Scheduling Policy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Optimal Throughput and Near-Optimal Asymptotic Delay Performance in Multichannel Wireless Networks With Low Complexity: A Practical Greedy Scheduling Policy","sourcePdf":"tnet-ji-2313120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122963S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7122959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7122959","articleId":"6798762","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6798766,"authors":[{"name":"Yunpeng Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6800037/6798766/6798766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunpeng Wang (s'12) received his B.S. degree from North China Electric Power University, Beijing, in 2009 and the M.S. degree from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA, in 2012, both in electrical engineering.

In this paper, the interactions and energy trading decisions of a number of geographically distributed storage units are studied using a novel framework based on game theory. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between storage units, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or an array of batteries that are trading their stored energy. Here, each storage unit's owner can decide on the maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the revenues from energy trading and the accompanying costs. Then in this energy exchange market between the storage units and the smart grid elements, the price at which energy is traded is determined via an auction mechanism. The game is shown to admit at least one Nash equilibrium and a novel algorithm that is guaranteed to reach such an equilibrium point is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant performance improvements, in terms of the average utility per storage unit, reaching up to 130.2% compared to a conventional greedy approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2284664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2284664","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6800037/06798766.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy Trading in the Smart Grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy Trading in the Smart Grid","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239057","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6798766/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy Trading in the Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-wang-2284664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154605S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6800037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"6800037","articleId":"6798766","onlineDate":"15 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6798767,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaotie Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6820808/6798767/6798767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaotie Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Fudan University, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

Converter-gating technique is further utilized as a countermeasure against side channel power analysis attacks by pseudo-randomly controlling the converter activity. A new method is proposed to improve the response time of the converter during transient load changes by adaptively configuring the conversion ratio of a switched capacitor voltage converter. The proposed converter is designed and verified using IBM 130 nm technology kit.

In this issue, we come back to the topic of via modeling and design in high-speed multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs). This is the third paper in a series, with the first two published in the EMC Magazine in 2012. Vias are common discontinuities in multilayer PCBs for high-speed digital signals. Understanding the effects of vias on signal integrity is important for practical engineering designs. This series of papers present an efficient modeling tool that can investigate various via structures in typical PCB designs up to 20 GHz. In this article, the methodology is applied to study the return current path of via structures and some design guidelines are then developed for impedance con- trol. The effects of via stubs are also discussed. I hope the readers will find some of the ideas and design guidelines proposed in this paper quite useful.","Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to invite your contributions to this column. Any topics related to signal and power integrity are welcome, as long as the papers are practically orientated.

This implies that via impedance can be controlled to match a specific target in order to minimize reflections. Furthermore, the via stub effect and alternatives to mitigate it by shifting unwanted resonances beyond the range of interest are addressed. Finally, both via impedance matching and stub length reduction methods were applied to a generic link configuration in order to assess the impact on signal integrity.","doi":"10.1109/MEMC.2014.6798802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962381/6798779/06798802.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMC.2014.6798802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal integrity: Efficient, physics-based via modeling: Return path, impedance, and stub effect control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1st Quarter  2014","displayDocTitle":"Signal integrity: Efficient, physics-based via modeling: Return path, impedance, and stub effect control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798802/","publicationDate":"1st Quarter 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14239311","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6798802/","volume":"3","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal integrity: Efficient, physics-based via modeling: Return path, impedance, and stub effect control","sourcePdf":"23EMCS1stQtr2014signal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1432S","chronDate":"1st Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962381","isNumber":"6798779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962381","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6798779","articleId":"6798802","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6798813,"authors":[{"name":"Math Bollen","affiliation":["Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Skellefte\u00e5, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962381/6798779/6798813/6798813-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Math Bollen (M'93-SM'96-F'05) received the PhD degree from Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 1989.

At the same time, research is ongoing at a number of locations, but the knowledge about supraharmonics remains limited. This paper compares some of the properties of harmonics and supraharmonics. An increase in supraharmonics for individual devices is observed in association with a decrease in harmonic emission (i.e. below 2 kHz). A proposal is made for setting limits in this frequency range. The proposal is based on existing standards and is meant to be for discussion. The authors strongly encourage an open discussion about the proposed limits. There are a number of differences between harmonics and supraharmonics that are not covered by the proposed set of limits. A substantial amount of further research is needed to extend the standard framework for supraharmonics such that this can be covered by standards.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"1st Quarter  2014","volume":"3","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14239308","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","publicationDate":"1st Quarter 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6798813/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Standards for supraharmonics (2 to 150 kHz)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standards for supraharmonics (2 to 150 kHz)","sourcePdf":"34EMCS1stQtr2014supraharmonics.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046392S","chronDate":"1st Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962381","isNumber":"6798779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962381","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6798779","articleId":"6798813","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6798856,"authors":[{"name":"Mikel Sagardia","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR)"],"firstName":"Mikel","lastName":"Sagardia","id":"37947337400"},{"name":"Theodoros Stouraitis","affiliation":["Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt Standort Bonn, Bonn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Theodoros","lastName":"Stouraitis","id":"37086314988"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Lopes e Silva","affiliation":["Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt Standort Bonn, Bonn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Lopes e Silva","id":"37088136827"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3624-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6798856","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Haptic interfaces","Rendering (computer graphics)","Engines","Force","Detection algorithms","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","haptic interfaces","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["haptic rendering algorithm","voxelized structures","point-sampled structures","physics engine bullet","voxmap-pointshell algorithm","voxelized distance fields","multiresolution point-sampled representations","collision detection engines"]},{"kwd":["I.3.5 [Computing Methodologies]: Computational Geometry and Object Modeling\u2014Geometric algorithms, Object hierarchies","I.3.7 [Computing Methodologies]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism\u2014Animation, Virtual reality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798856","abstract":"We present the evaluation of a haptic rendering algorithm based on the Voxmap-Pointshell algorithm which was integrated in the physics engine Bullet.

This leads to the use of optimised, application-specific components. In exploration and surveillance scenarios, electro-optical (EO) sensors in combination with embedded systems are very suitable to contribute to various perception tasks. EO sensors are lightweight, affordable and provide a high-quality representation of vehicle's environment. Embedded systems are energy-efficient, space-saving and provide powerful computing capabilities. But processing of high-resolution images is challenging, especially in the context of embedded computing and real-time data exploitation. Considering these conditions, the article introduces a novel FPGA-based approach for runway boundary recognition. The source image is scanned line-by-line to identify colour variations. Locations with strong colour discontinuity are grouped to lines which are used for runway pattern extraction in image. The classifier-less approach is independent from runway colour, brightness and contrast and doesn't require additional markers. The final detection is evaluated by a confidence value indicating its trustiness. The determinability of the worst case execution time and the robustness over a wide dynamic range demonstrate the certifiability of the implementation. It will be tested on an unmanned aerial vehicle for automated landing.","doi":"10.1109/SAS.2014.6798917","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783958/6798900/06798917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2014.6798917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798900","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based approach for runway boundary detection in high-resolution colour images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based approach for runway boundary detection in high-resolution colour images","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254042","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6798917/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based approach for runway boundary detection in high-resolution colour images","confLoc":"Queenstown, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1569830705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078711S","chronDate":"18-20 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783958","isNumber":"6798900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783958","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6798900","articleId":"6798917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6798918,"authors":[{"name":"Jabal Raval","affiliation":["Tata Consultancy Services, TCS Innovation Labs Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Jabal","lastName":"Raval","id":"37085461335"},{"name":"Bhushan Jagyasi","affiliation":["Tata Consultancy Services, TCS Innovation Labs Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Bhushan","lastName":"Jagyasi","id":"37545746600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2179-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2180-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6798918","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Biological neural networks","Spread spectrum communication","Neurons","Least squares approximations","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Bayes methods","neural nets","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed detection","neural network based multihop wireless sensor network","neural network based data aggregation approach","neural network based back propagation algorithm","LMS based adaptive weighted aggregation scheme","tree network","nonadaptive Bayesian approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798918","abstract":"In this paper, a Neural Network based data aggregation approach to detect the binary events in a multi-hop Wireless Sensor Network has been proposed.

On the other hand, the microwave exists only around the LCX in surface mode. Although the conventional LCX-based sensor operates the LCX in only one mode to detect and classify an object, this paper introduces a simultaneous sensing technique using these two modes. Comparing the signals in both modes, the classification of an object can be estimated. The theory of the emitting modes of LCX and the developed sensor prototype are described.

Tracking vehicles that travel along highway is one of the potential applications, and the vehicles can be continuously tracked from the entrance to the exit without being lost. Such a system can be used for surveillance and analysis of traffic congestions/accidents. Each vehicle passes a large number of cameras at high speed, one ofter another. Higher frame rate and faster data communication are desired for reliable target tracking and system scalability. We developed a prototype system that captures the moving vehicle with 1000 frames-per-second and that shares the small feature data only between a pair of adjacent cameras. A 1/10-scale vehicle moving across two cameras at 2500 mm/s \u2248 9 km/h was successfully tracked by the experimental system. Tracking a laser pointer spot moving at faster than 100 km/h on the floor is also demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/SAS.2014.6798973","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783958/6798900/06798973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2014.6798973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798900","startPage":"343","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A networked high-speed vision system for vehicle tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A networked high-speed vision system for vehicle tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6798973/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254031","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6798973/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A networked high-speed vision system for vehicle tracking","confLoc":"Queenstown, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1569846809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058925S","chronDate":"18-20 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783958","isNumber":"6798900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783958","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6798900","articleId":"6798973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799056,"authors":[{"name":"Yosuke Mukai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Mukai","id":"37085860267"},{"name":"Katsuhiro Naito","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhiro","lastName":"Naito","id":"37562415100"},{"name":"Kazuo Mori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Mori","id":"37276437300"},{"name":"Hideo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37279510000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2231-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799056","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Frequency estimation","Frequency synchronization","Relays","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","error statistics","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network routing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM cooperative communication","multihop networks","autonomous networks","multihop routings","flooding mechanisms","wireless resources","broadcast storm problems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM receivers","OFDM symbols","guard interval period","wireless device","IEEE 802.11a/g","symbol structure","IEEE 802.11a standard","IEEE 802.11a device","bit error ratio performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE802.11a","OFDM","Synchronization","Cooperative communication","Multi-hop communication"]}],"abstract":"Multi-hop networks have been proposed as a new type of autonomous networks recently. Various multi-hop routings employ flooding mechanisms, where all terminals retransmit a same packet to a whole network to distribute information. It is well known that flooding mechanisms consume a lot of wireless resources. Additionally, broadcast storm problems occur when a number of nodes or traffic increase in a network. The authors have proposed a new cooperative communication scheme focusing on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). We focus that OFDM receivers can demodulate some same OFDM symbols within guard interval (GI) period. Therefore, the proposed scheme employs multiple transmission of a same OFDM symbol from some senders. We have clarified that the proposed scheme is effective in multi-hop networks from the fundamental evaluation. However, the evaluation is not enough to explain the effectiveness in actual wireless device such as IEEE 802.11a/g because symbol structure of these standard is more complex. This paper evaluates the performance of the OFDM cooperative communication in case of the IEEE 802.11a standard. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can work well on the IEEE 802.11a device and can improve the bit error ratio performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICMU.2014.6799056","publicationTitle":"2014 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Computing and Ubiquitous Networking (ICMU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Computing and Ubiquitous Networking (ICMU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783956/6799045/06799056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMU.2014.6799056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799045","startPage":"44","endPage":"49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of the OFDM cooperative communication on the assumption IEEE802.11a","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of the OFDM cooperative communication on the assumption IEEE802.11a","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799056/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14253967","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799056/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of the OFDM cooperative communication on the assumption IEEE802.11a","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p44mukai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042079S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783956","isNumber":"6799045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783956","xplore-issue":"6799045","articleId":"6799056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6799134,"authors":[{"name":"Elkin Garcia","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Parallel System Laboratory (CAPSL), University of Delaware, Newark, DE, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Elkin","lastName":"Garcia","id":"38238049000"},{"name":"Daniel Orozco","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Parallel System Laboratory (CAPSL), University of Delaware, Newark, DE, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Orozco","id":"37680104900"},{"name":"Rishi Khan","affiliation":["ET International, Newark, DE, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086774069"},{"name":"Ioannis E.

Successful strategies inherited from previous generations of parallel or serial architectures just return incremental gains in performance and further optimization and tuning are required. We argue that conservative static optimizations are not the best fit for modern many-core architectures. The limited advantages of static techniques come from the new scenarios present in many-cores: Plenty of thread units sharing several resources under different coordination mechanisms. We point out that scheduling and data movement across the memory hierarchy are extremely important in the performance of applications. In particular, we found that scheduling of data movement operations significantly impact performance. To overcome those difficulties, we took advantage of the fine-grain synchronization primitives of many-cores to define percolation operations in order to schedule data movement properly. In addition, we have fused percolation operations with dynamic scheduling into a dynamic percolation approach. We used Dense Matrix Multiplication on a modern manycore to illustrate how our proposed techniques are able to increase the performance under these new environments. In our study on the IBM Cyclops-64, we raised the performance from 44 GFLOPS (out of 80 GFLOPS possible) to 70.0 GFLOPS (operands in on-chip memory) and 65.6 GFLOPS (operands in off-chip memory). The success of our approach also resulted in excellent power efficiency: 1.09 GFLOPS/Watt and 993 MFLOPS/Watt when the input data resided in on-chip and off-chip memory respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic schema to increase performance in many-core architectures through percolation operations","publicationTitle":"20th Annual International Conference on High Performance Computing","doi":"10.1109/HiPC.2013.6799134","displayPublicationTitle":"20th Annual International Conference on High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784161/6799095/06799134.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HiPC.2013.6799134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic schema to increase performance in many-core architectures through percolation operations","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799134/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254583","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic schema to increase performance in many-core architectures through percolation operations","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"1569788703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088605S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784161","isNumber":"6799095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784161","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6799095","articleId":"6799134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6799179,"authors":[{"name":"Jianjun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086637446"},{"name":"Yiming Lei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Lei","id":"37403158400"},{"name":"Mingke Dong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingke","lastName":"Dong","id":"37290589800"},{"name":"Ye Jin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Jin","id":"38541213500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6799179","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a novel factor graph equalization based on a serial layered scheduling (SLS) algorithm of belief propagation, where the channel convolutional matrix is decomposed according to the distribution of its non-zero elements.

Simulation results show that the proposed post-filter achieves better crosstalk suppression than the Wiener filter for BSS.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2317761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6810877/06799183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2317761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810877","startPage":"942","endPage":"946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GMM Post-Filter for Residual Crosstalk Suppression in Blind Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A GMM Post-Filter for Residual Crosstalk Suppression in Blind Source Separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14281987","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799183/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GMM Post-Filter for Residual Crosstalk Suppression in Blind Source Separation","sourcePdf":"lsp-khong-2317761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05686S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6810877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6810877","articleId":"6799183","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799185,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Morant","affiliation":["Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Maria Morant (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912) received the M.Sc. degree\n in telecommunication engineering in 2008 and the International Ph.D. degree from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de\n Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain, in 2012.

Even though the set of codes is identical for all of these channels, the bounds that we obtain vary. Prior to this paper, only the bounds corresponding to the all-insertion case and the all-deletion case were known. We recover these as special cases. The bound from the all-deletion case, due to Levenshtein, has been the best known for more than 45 years.

The stator is constituted by T-shaped lamination segments sandwiched with circumferentially magnetized PMs with alternate polarity, while the rotor is identical to that of switched reluctance machines (SRMs). The stator pole number is multiples of six, which is the number of stator poles in a unit machine. Similar to variable flux reluctance machines (VFRMs), the rotor pole numbers in the novel machines are not restricted to those in SRMs. When the stator and rotor pole numbers differ by one (or the number of multiples), the novel synchronous machines show sinusoidal bipolar phase flux linkage and back electromotive force (EMF), which make the machines suitable for brushless ac operation. Moreover, two prototype machines with six-pole stator and five-pole, seven-pole rotors are designed and optimized by 2-D finite element analysis. It shows that, compared with VFRMs, the novel machines can produce ~70 % higher torque density with the same copper loss and machine size. Meanwhile, the proposed machines have negligible reluctance torque due to very low saliency ratio. Experimental results of back EFM, cogging torque, and average torque on the prototypes are provided to validate the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799207/","volume":"50","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6799207/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14580655","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2014","externalId":"8102009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Performance of Novel Synchronous Machines With Permanent Magnets in Stator Yoke","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Performance of Novel Synchronous Machines With Permanent Magnets in Stator Yoke","sourcePdf":"tmag-wu-2317794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081668S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6894652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6894652","articleId":"6799207","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6799210,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea M.

Unlike existing algorithms which use a static uniform scheme for the distribution of projection vectors, the proposed scheme examines local curvature in multidimensional spaces to produce a data-adaptive set of direction vectors for taking signal projections. This is achieved by aligning the density of projection vectors according to the empirical distributions of angles where the signal exhibits highest local dynamics. We show that the proposed methodology outperforms the existing schemes for a small number of signal projections.

Poor visibility caused by atmospheric phenomena in turn causes failure in computer vision applications, such as outdoor object recognition systems, obstacle detection systems, video surveillance systems, and intelligent transportation systems. In order to solve this problem, visibility restoration (VR) techniques have been developed and play an important role in many computer vision applications that operate in various weather conditions. However, removing haze from a single image with a complex structure and color distortion is a difficult task for VR techniques. This paper proposes a novel VR method that uses a combination of three major modules: 1) a depth estimation (DE) module; 2) a color analysis (CA) module; and 3) a VR module. The proposed DE module takes advantage of the median filter technique and adopts our adaptive gamma correction technique. By doing so, halo effects can be avoided in images with complex structures, and effective transmission map estimation can be achieved. The proposed CA module is based on the gray world assumption and analyzes the color characteristics of the input hazy image. Subsequently, the VR module uses the adjusted transmission map and the color-correlated information to repair the color distortion in variable scenes captured during inclement weather conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides superior haze removal in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art method through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of different scenes captured during various weather conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2317854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6913590/06799227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2317854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6913590","startPage":"1814","endPage":"1824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visibility Restoration of Single Hazy Images Captured in Real-World Weather Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visibility Restoration of Single Hazy Images Captured in Real-World Weather Conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14648344","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799227/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC 100-2628-E-027-012-MY3 and NSC 102-2221-E-027-065"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visibility Restoration of Single Hazy Images Captured in Real-World Weather Conditions","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-huang-2317854-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066432S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6913590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6913590","articleId":"6799227","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6799229,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwei Pang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6960135/6799229/pang-2306844-small.gif","p":["Yanwei Pang (M'07\u2013SM'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.

The main reason is that the between- and within-class scatter matrices computed from the limited number of training samples deviate greatly from the underlying ones. To overcome the problem without increasing the number of training samples, we propose making use of the structure of the given training data to regularize the between- and within-class scatter matrices by between- and within-cluster scatter matrices, respectively, and simultaneously. The within- and between-cluster matrices are computed from unsupervised clustered data. The within-cluster scatter matrix contributes to encoding the possible variations in intraclasses and the between-cluster scatter matrix is useful for separating extra classes. The contributions are inversely proportional to the number of training samples per class. The advantages of the proposed method become more remarkable as the number of training samples per class decreases. Experimental results on the AR and Feret face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2306844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6960135/06799229.pdf","startPage":"2191","endPage":"2201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2306844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Regularized LDA by Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799229/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Regularized LDA by Clustering","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14759084","pubMedId":"25420242","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799229/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Program of National Natural Science of China","grantNumber":"61232010"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2014CB340404 and 2014CB340403"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172121, 61172143, 61271412 and 61222109"},{"fundingName":"Open Funding Project of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University","grantNumber":"BUAA-VR-13KF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-10-0620"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Regularized LDA by Clustering","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yuan-2306844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11202S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6960135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6960135","articleId":"6799229","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799231,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Hwan Park","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research (CWCSPR), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Seok-Hwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293216300"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research (CWCSPR), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Onur Sahin","affiliation":["InterDigital Inc., Melville, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Sahin","id":"37304614500"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6799231","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":877},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Joints","Quantization (signal)","Noise","Baseband","Interference","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","data compression","interference (signal)","iterative methods","linear codes","optimisation","precoding","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercluster design","fronthaul compression","fronthaul links","multicluster cloud radio access networks","C-RAN","channel coding","linear precoding","intracluster optimization","intercluster optimization","weighted sum-rate maximization","iterative algorithm","intercluster interference"]},{"kwd":["Cloud radio access networks (C-RANs)","inter-cluster interference","constrained fronthaul","multivariate compression"]}],"abstract":"This work studies the joint design of precoding and fronthaul compression for the downlink of multi-cluster cloud radio access networks (C-RANs). In these systems, each cluster of radio units (RUs) is managed by a different control unit (CU) through fronthaul links of limited capacity. Each CU performs baseband processing, including channel coding and linear precoding, for all the connected RUs, and then compresses the precoded signals for transmission to the RUs over the corresponding fronthaul links. In a recent work, it was shown that joint, rather than conventional separate, compression of the signals of different RUs leads to significant performance gains. However, the approach therein was limited to the intra-cluster optimization of precoding and joint compression, hence leading to significant performance loss in the presence of mutually interfering clusters. This work proposes instead to perform the inter-cluster optimization of precoding and joint compression. Specifically, the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate maximization across multiple clusters is tackled by deriving an iterative algorithm that converges to a locally optimal point of the problem. From numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing approach based on intra-cluster optimization.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2014.2317735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6880865/06799231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2014.2317735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6880865","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-Cluster Design of Precoding and Fronthaul Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inter-Cluster Design of Precoding and Fronthaul Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14547903","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799231/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-Cluster Design of Precoding and Fronthaul Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"lwc-park-2317735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103039S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6880865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6880865","articleId":"6799231","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6799233,"authors":[{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["COMSENS Research Center, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Gesualdo","lastName":"Scutari","id":"37269398400"},{"name":"Francisco Facchinei","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Facchinei","id":"37397893900"},{"name":"Jong-Shi Pang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Shi","lastName":"Pang","id":"37398640400"},{"name":"Daniel P.

In this paper, we consider a general class of convex Nash equilibrium problems (NEPs), where each player aims at solving an arbitrary smooth convex optimization problem. Differently from most of current works, we do not assume any specific structure for the players' problems, and we allow the optimization variables of the players to be matrices in the complex domain. Our main contribution is the design of a novel class of distributed (asynchronous) best-response-algorithms suitable for solving the proposed NEPs, even in the presence of multiple solutions. The new methods, whose convergence analysis is based on variational inequality (VI) techniques, can select, among all the equilibria of a game, those that optimize a given performance criterion, at the cost of limited signaling among the players. This is a major departure from existing best-response algorithms, whose convergence conditions imply the uniqueness of the NE. Some of our results hinge on the use of VI problems directly in the complex domain; the study of these new kind of VIs also represents a noteworthy innovative contribution. We then apply the developed methods to solve some new generalizations of Single Input Single Output (SISO) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) games in cognitive radio systems, showing a considerable performance improvement over classical pure noncooperative schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real and Complex Monotone Communication Games","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2317791","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6832684/06799233.pdf","startPage":"4197","endPage":"4231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2317791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Real and Complex Monotone Communication Games","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6799233/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14379335","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1218717"},{"fundingName":"CAREER","grantNumber":"1254739"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-0969600"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"617810"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real and Complex Monotone Communication Games","sourcePdf":"tit-scutari-2317791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.324761S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6832684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6832684","articleId":"6799233","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799235,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangfeng Han","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuangfeng","lastName":"Han","id":"37085347882"},{"name":"Chih-Lin I","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chih-Lin","lastName":"I","id":"37282841300"},{"name":"Zhikun Xu","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhikun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085392838"},{"name":"Sen Wang","affiliation":["Green Communication Research Center, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085367637"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6799235","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2840},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Antennas","Arrays","Mobile communication","Estimation","MIMO","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication","planar antenna arrays","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reference signals design","hybrid analog beamforming structure","hybrid digital beamforming structure","massive MIMO deployment","calibration","complexity","cost","gain maximization","ABF main beam direction","angle-of-arrival","angle-of-departure","large scale antenna system","planar antenna array"]},{"kwd":["Analog beamforming","digital beamforming","hybrid beamforming","reference signals","angle of arrival","angle of departure"]}],"abstract":"There are many issues regarding the implementation of digital beamforming (BF) structures in massive MIMO: calibration, complexity, and cost. In a practical massive MIMO deployment, hybrid digital and analog BF structures with active antennas can be an alternative choice. In this letter, an N (the number of transceivers) by M (the number of active antennas per transceiver) hybrid BF structure is investigated, where the analog BF (ABF) is performed per transceiver and digital BF (DBF) is performed across N transceivers. A hybrid BF scheme is proposed, where the same ABF is applied to each transceiver, on top of which a DBF is designed to maximize the gain in a certain direction around the ABFs main beam direction. The proposed hybrid BF design establishes an inherent connection between the DBF and the beam direction of hybrid BF. Therefore, beam domain reference signals (RSs) can be conveniently implemented via applying properly designed DBF on subcarriers within the coherent bandwidth. Simulation results are given to show the validity of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference Signals Design for Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2317747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6850102/06799235.pdf","startPage":"1191","endPage":"1193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2317747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Reference Signals Design for Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6799235/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14429905","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference Signals Design for Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming","sourcePdf":"lcomm-han-2317747-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086037S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6850102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6850102","articleId":"6799235","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799238,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Han","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6823195/6799238/han-2315234-small.gif","p":["Yong Han received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology from the Institute of Electronics of Chinese Academy of Sciences (IECAS), Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","He was an Assistant Researcher with the Key Laboratory of High Power Microwave Sources and Technologies, IECAS, after graduation.

transmission to improve the capacity of femtocell without affecting the normal communications of macrocell users (MUs). In specific, the femtocell access point (FAP) assists the macrocell base station (MBS) by jointly transmiting to the MU in the vicinity of the femtocell. A portion of the spectrum originally assigned to the MU is reserved for CoMP. In return, the rest can be freely utilized by the femtocell. Moreover, the impact of non-ideal backhaul (NIB) is considered, which makes the joint spectrum splitting and power allocation non-convex. A universal dual bisection algorithm is proposed to achieve the globally optimal solution. Simulation results indicate that the capacity of femtocell is enhanced up to 200% relative to the traditional methods. Meanwhile, the data communications of MUs are well protected compared with the scheme that ignores the impact of NIB.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2317774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6827269/06799244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2317774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6827269","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Ideal Backhaul Based Spectrum Splitting and Power Allocation for Downlink <roman>CoMP</roman> in Cognitive Macro/Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Ideal Backhaul Based Spectrum Splitting and Power Allocation for Downlink <roman>CoMP</roman> in Cognitive Macro/Femtocell Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14351680","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799244/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"863 Project No. 2014AA01A701"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingName":"Special Youth Science Foundation of Jiangxi"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi"},{"fundingName":"National Key Scientific and Technological Project of China"},{"fundingName":"Huawei's Innovation Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Ideal Backhaul Based Spectrum Splitting and Power Allocation for Downlink <roman>CoMP</roman> in Cognitive Macro/Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-chen-2317774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071108S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6827269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6827269","articleId":"6799244","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799254,"authors":[{"name":"Kazi S.

The steady-state fuzzy efficiency controller is a search controller operating only in steady state to minimize the drive power losses to achieve higher efficiency by reducing the stator flux. The transient-state fuzzy efficiency controller operates only during transient state to increase the flux, depending on the speed error and its derivative. In order to achieve high dynamic performance, another FLC is used as speed controller, which controls the torque component of the stator current. Furthermore, a torque compensator is used to reduce the torque and speed ripples. The efficacy of the proposed IPMSM drive for efficiency optimization and robustness is tested in both simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2014.2317845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/6949174/06799264.pdf","startPage":"4251","endPage":"4259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2014.2317845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Logic-Based Efficiency Optimization and High Dynamic Performance of IPMSM Drive System in Both Transient and Steady-State Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Logic-Based Efficiency Optimization and High Dynamic Performance of IPMSM Drive System in Both Transient and Steady-State Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2014","volume":"50","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799264/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14758958","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Logic-Based Efficiency Optimization and High Dynamic Performance of IPMSM Drive System in Both Transient and Steady-State Conditions","sourcePdf":"tia-uddin-2317845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075084S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6949174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6949174","articleId":"6799264","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6799267,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Barletta","affiliation":["Institute for Advanced Study, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Barletta (M'13) received the M.S. degree (cum laude) in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","He currently is a postdoc member at Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen\u2014Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS).

In the Gaussian and linear case, the information rate can be evaluated from the probabilities computed by the Kalman filter. When the probability distributions inferred by Bayesian tracking are nontractable, one is forced to resort to approximated inference, which gives only an approximation to the wanted probabilities. We propose upper and lower bounds to the information rate between the hidden state and the measurement based on approximated inference. Application of these bounds to multiplicative communication channels is discussed, and experimental results for the discrete-time phase noise channel and for the Gauss-Markov fading channel are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","volume":"60","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14379316","publicationDate":"July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799267/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Upper and Lower Bounds to the Information Rate Transferred Through First-Order Markov Channels With Free-Running Continuous State","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen-Institute for Advanced Study through the German Excellence Initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper and Lower Bounds to the Information Rate Transferred Through First-Order Markov Channels With Free-Running Continuous State","sourcePdf":"tit-barletta-2317694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080983S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6832684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6832684","articleId":"6799267","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799269,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Achievability is based on the idea of phase alignment (PA) precoding, where instead of nulling out the destructive interference, it judiciously rotates the phases of the transmitted symbols. In this way, they add up coherently at the intended user and yield higher received SNRs. In addition, it is well known that regularized channel inversion (RCI) precoding improves the performance of channel inversion (CI) in multiantenna downlink communications. In line with this and similar to the RCI precoding, in this paper, we propose the idea of regularized PA (RPA), which is shown to improve the performance of original PA precoding. To do this, we first rectify the original PA precoding, deriving a closed-form expression to evaluate the amount of transmit-power reduction achieved for the same average output SNR compared with CI precoding. We then use this new analysis to select the appropriate regularization factor for our proposed RPA scheme. It is shown by means of theoretical analysis and simulations that the proposed RPA precoding outperforms CI, RCI, and PA precoders from both symbol error rate (SER) and throughput perspectives and provides a more power-efficient alternative. This is particularly pronounced as the number of transmit antennas becomes larger, where up to a 50-times reduction in the transmit power is achieved by RPA (PA) compared with RCI (CI) precoding for a given performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06799269.pdf","startPage":"4383","endPage":"4394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2317716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2317716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit-Power Efficient Linear Precoding Utilizing Known Interference for the Multiantenna Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Downlink","Covariance matrices","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy conservation","error statistics","precoding","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiantenna downlink communication","channel information","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","power transmission","phase alignment precoding","destructive interference","regularized channel inversion","RCI precoding","regularization factor","symbol error rate","SER","transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear precoding","multiantenna downlink transmission","phase alignment (PA)","power-efficient communications"]},{"kwd":["Linear precoding","multiantenna downlink transmission","phase alignment (PA)","power-efficient communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Transmit-Power Efficient Linear Precoding Utilizing Known Interference for the Multiantenna Downlink","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6799269/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735181","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) programme within the Seventh Framework Programme for Research of the European Commission","grantNumber":"265578"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"Royal Academy of Engineering, U.K."}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Transmit-Power Efficient Linear Precoding Utilizing Known Interference for the Multiantenna Downlink","sourcePdf":"tvt-razavi-2317716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117888S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6799269","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799273,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Various eNVM technologies have been explored for high-density applications including dual-poly embedded flash (eflash), FeRAM, STT-MRAM, and RRAM. On the other end of the spectrum, logic-compatible eNVM such as e-fuse, anti-fuse, and single-poly eflash memories have been considered for moderate-density low-cost applications. In particular, single-poly eflash memory has been gaining momentum as it can be implemented in a generic logic process while supporting multiple program-erase cycles. One key challenge for single-poly eflash is enabling bit-by-bit re-write operation without a boosted bitline voltage as this could cause disturbance issues in the unselected wordlines. In this work, we present details of a bit-by-bit re-writable eflash memory implemented in a generic 65 nm logic process which addresses this key challenge. The proposed 6 T eflash memory cell can improve the overall cell endurance by eliminating redundant program/erase cycles while preventing disturbance issues in the unselected wordlines. We also provide details of special high voltage circuits such as a voltage-doubler based charge pump circuit and a multistory high-voltage switch, for generating a reliable high-voltage output without causing damage to the standard logic transistors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799274/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","volume":"49","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469217","htmlLink":"/document/6799274/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Bit-by-Bit Re-Writable Eflash in a Generic 65 nm Logic Process for Moderate-Density Nonvolatile Memory Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bit-by-Bit Re-Writable Eflash in a Generic 65 nm Logic Process for Moderate-Density Nonvolatile Memory Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-song-2314445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050065S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6861467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6861467","articleId":"6799274","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799282,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Yao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Wuhan Second Ship Design and Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6923502/6799282/yao-small.gif","p":["Chuan Yao received the B.S. degree in the electrical engineering and\n automatization from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the College of\n Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2013.","He is currently an Engineer in the Wuhan Second Ship Design and Research Institute, Wuhan.

In order to reduce the influence of the input voltage disturbance on the output voltage, the small-signal model of FB-boost converter is built and the input voltage feed-forward (IVFF) functions under different operating modes are derived in this paper. In view of the small-signal and large-signal control laws of the derived IVFF functions, the two-mode PS-TEM control schemes with small-signal and large-signal IVFF compensations are proposed, respectively. Both of them can realize automatic selection of operating modes and the corresponding IVFF compensations, and thus high efficiency and improved input transient response can be guaranteed. Besides, the IVFF function in boost mode is simplified for easy implementation, and the comparisons among the two-mode PS-TEM control schemes with small-signal, large-signal, and without IVFF compensations are presented in this paper. Finally, a 250-500-V input, 360-V output, and 6-kW-rated power prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2317795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2317795","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1682","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6923502/06799282.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Mode-Shifting Control Strategy With Input Voltage Feed-Forward for Full-Bridge-Boost DC\u2013DC Converter Suitable for Wide Input Voltage Range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Mode-Shifting Control Strategy With Input Voltage Feed-Forward for Full-Bridge-Boost DC\u2013DC Converter Suitable for Wide Input Voltage Range","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799282/","accessionNumber":"14665208","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799282/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"50837003 and 51007027"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Province 333 Program for Excellent Talents","grantNumber":"BRA2012141"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"YAH12012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Mode-Shifting Control Strategy With Input Voltage Feed-Forward for Full-Bridge-Boost DC\u2013DC Converter Suitable for Wide Input Voltage Range","sourcePdf":"tpel-yao-2317795-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101221S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6923502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6923502","articleId":"6799282","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6799287,"authors":[{"name":"Prafullachandra M.

In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-independent diagnosis and layout aware (DLA) scan chain stitching method: 1) the resolution is improved by increasing and properly distributing the sensitive scan cells, which can capture useful diagnostic information under both single- and multiple-fault situations; and 2) the scan cell layout placement is taken into account to reduce routing overhead and hence preserve the chip performance. Experiments using two different techniques to diagnose ISCAS'89/ITC'99 benchmark circuits with/without embedded scan compaction show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the diagnostic resolution. Impacts on chip performance, embedded scan compaction, transition fault coverage, and test power dissipation are negligible. The proposed method is also successfully applied to an industry circuit manufactured with 20-nm technology. The silicon results show 7\u00d7 average resolution improvement comparing to without using the DLA scan chain stitching.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2313563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7046457/06799296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2313563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7046457","startPage":"466","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis and Layout Aware (DLA) Scan Chain Stitching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis and Layout Aware (DLA) Scan Chain Stitching","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14931647","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6799296/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61076018, 61274030, 61376043 and 61204047"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973)","grantNumber":"2011CB302503"},{"fundingName":"Cooperative Project through Mentor Graphics"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis and Layout Aware (DLA) Scan Chain Stitching","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ye-2313563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183787S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7046457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7046457","articleId":"6799296","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799297,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nantong University, Nantong, ON, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6799297/ji-2317748-small.gif","p":["\nXiaodong Ji (M'13) received the B.S. degree (with excellence) in\nelectronic and information engineering from Nantong Institute of Technology, Nantong, China, in 2003 and the M.S. and\nPh.D. degrees in signal and information processing from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing,\nChina, in 2006 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia\nUniversity, Montreal, QC, Canada.

Unlike most of the existing works, our network scenario has asymmetric traffic requirements, and each terminal in the network is subject to an individual power constraint in addition to a total power consumption constraint of the network. To fulfill power control, instantaneous or statistical channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be available at the transmitter of each terminal. By dividing the overall power control problem into a few subproblems corresponding to different power constraints, and using the traffic knowledge along with the CSI, two power control strategies, called short- and long-term strategies, are proposed, leading to closed-form solutions for individual transmit powers at the relay and the sources that are adapted to certain traffic requirements and channel conditions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power control strategies. It is shown that the short-term strategy can achieve a significant performance gain in terms of the outage probability, regardless of symmetric or asymmetric traffics and channels, and meanwhile, the long-term strategy is more appropriate to asymmetric traffic and channel conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Relays","Optimization","Erbium","Approximation methods","Transmitters","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","power consumption","power control","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication control","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power control","two-way amplify-and-forward relaying","power constraints","outage probability minimization","asymmetric traffic requirements","power consumption","statistical channel state information","long-term strategies","powers transmission","channel conditions"]},{"kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","asymmetric two-way relaying (TWR)","individual power constraint","power control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2317748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06799297.pdf","startPage":"4315","endPage":"4333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2317748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Power Control for Asymmetric Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying With Individual Power Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Power Control for Asymmetric Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying With Individual Power Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799297/","volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799297/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14735176","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Regroupement strat\u00e9gique en microsyst\u00e8mes du Qu\u00e9bec (ReSMiQ)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371111"},{"fundingName":"Universities Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"12KJB510024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Power Control for Asymmetric Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying With Individual Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-ji-2317748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103417S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6799297","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6799301,"authors":[{"name":"Mabel Pont\u00f3n","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Department, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6809863/6799301/6799301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mabel Pont\u00f3n (S'08\u2013M'11) was born in Santander, Spain.

The possible coexistence of oscillation modes is investigated with a detailed bifurcation analysis versus practical parameters such as the device bias voltage. The phase-noise spectrum is predicted from the variance of the common phase deviation. The parameters that determine this variance are identified with the conversion-matrix approach.

In a multihop CRN consisting of SUs as relays, such spectrum dynamics will further cause the invalidity of predetermined routes. In this paper, we investigate spectrum-mobility-incurred route-switching problems in both spatial and frequency domains for CRNs, where spatial switching determines which relays and links should be reselected and frequency switching decides which channels ought to be reassigned to the spatial routes. The proposed route-switching scheme not only avoids conflicts with PUs but also mitigates spectrum congestion. Meanwhile, tradeoffs between routing costs and channel switching costs are achieved. We further formulate the route-switching problem as the Route-Switching Game, which is shown to be a potential game and has a pure Nash equilibrium (NE). Accordingly, efficient algorithms for finding the NE and the \u03b5-NE are proposed. Then, we extend the proposed game to the incomplete-information scenario and provide a method to compute the Bayesian NE. Finally, we prove that the price of anarchy of the proposed game has a deterministic upper bound.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2315194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7203177/06799302.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2315194","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Route Switching in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Game-Theoretical Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Route Switching in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Game-Theoretical Framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799302/","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6799302/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365206","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Route Switching in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Game-Theoretical Framework","sourcePdf":"tnet-wang-2315194-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104013S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7203177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7203177","articleId":"6799302","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799304,"authors":[{"name":"Mate Boban","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe, NEC Europe Ltd., Kurf\u00fcrsten-Anlage 36, Heidelberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6799304/boban-2317803-small.gif","p":["\nMate Boban received the Diploma in Informatics from the University of\nZagreb, Croatia, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University,\nPittsburgh, PA, USA.

Comparing with the traditional method, compressed sensing asserts that a sparse signal can be reconstructed from very few measurements. A central problem in compressed sensing is the construction of sensing matrices. While random sensing matrices have been studied intensively, only a few deterministic constructions are known. As a long-standing subject in combinatorial design theory, the packing design gives rise to deterministic sparse matrices with low coherence. With this framework in mind, we investigate a series of packing designs originated from finite geometry. The connection between the sensing matrix and finite geometry is revealed, using the packing design as a bridge. More specifically, we construct a series of m \u00d7n binary sensing matrices with sparsity order k=\u0398(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/3</sup>\n) or k=\u0398(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sup>\n). Moreover, we use an embedding operation to merge our binary matrices with matrices having low coherence. Comparing with the original binary matrices, this embedding operation generates modified matrices with better recovery performance. Numerical simulations show that our binary and modified matrices outperform several typical sensing matrices.

Cognitive radios simultaneously transmit their sensing results to the fusion center (FC) over multipath fading reporting channels. The cognitive radios estimate the phases of the reporting channels and use those estimates for coherent combining of the sensing results at the FC. A global decision is made at the FC by comparing the received signal with a threshold. We obtain the global detection probabilities and secondary throughput exactly through a moment generating function approach. We verify our solution via system simulation and demonstrate that the Chernoff bound and central limit theory approximation are not tight. The cases of hard sensing and soft sensing are considered and we provide examples in which hard sensing is advantageous to soft sensing. We contrast the performance of SEGC with maximum ratio combining of the sensors' results and provide examples where the former is superior. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of SEGC against existing orthogonal reporting techniques such as time division multiple access (TDMA). SEGC performance always dominates that of TDMA in terms of secondary throughput. We also study the impact of phase and synchronization errors and demonstrate the robustness of the SEGC technique against such imperfections.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2317788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6874603/06799312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2317788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6874603","startPage":"4334","endPage":"4345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equal Gain Combining for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Equal Gain Combining for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14513504","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799312/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equal Gain Combining for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-hamza-2317788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091196S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6874603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6874603","articleId":"6799312","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799314,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Syrjala","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6836134/6799314/6799314-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ville Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 (S'09, M'12) was born in Lapua, Finland, in 1982.

Closed-form solutions are derived for the power of the residual self-interference stemming from phase noise in two alternative cases of having either independent oscillators or the same oscillator at the transmitter and receiver chains of the full-duplex transceiver. The results show that phase noise has a severe effect on self-interference cancellation in both of the considered cases, and that by using the common oscillator in upconversion and downconversion results in clearly lower residual self-interference levels. The results also show that it is in general vital to use high quality oscillators in full-duplex transceivers, or have some means for phase noise estimation and mitigation in order to suppress its effects. One of the main findings is that in practical scenarios the subcarrier-wise phase-noise spread of the multipath components of the self-interference channel causes most of the residual phase-noise effect when high amounts of self-interference cancellation is desired.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","volume":"13","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14415139","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799314/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Oscillator Phase-Noise Effects on Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex OFDM Radio Transceivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Oscillator Phase-Noise Effects on Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex OFDM Radio Transceivers","sourcePdf":"2977-tw1406-ville.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11727S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6836134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6836134","articleId":"6799314","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6799315,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Geraci","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6799315/6799315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giovanni Geraci (S'I) received the B.

A single-stream scenario is considered in which one or more primary receivers request nulls by providing limited feedback to the transmitter. Without receiver coordination, each primary receiver informs the transmitter of its best beamforming precoding vector. The transmitter then selects a zero-forcing precoding vector orthogonal to all of the beamforming precoding vectors. With receiver coordination, the primary receivers feed back the common precoding vector that minimizes the average interference. In both cases, secondary receivers in the network do not provide feedback and experience channels statistically equivalent to a single-antenna fading channel.

We consider that in addition to the statistics of the main and the eavesdropper channel state information (CSI), the sender is provided by the legitimate receiver with a q-bit feedback, at the beginning of each coherence block, through an error-free public channel, with capacity q bits. We establish upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity. We show that the lower and the upper bounds coincide asymptotically as q \u2192 \u221e. When applied to Rayleigh fading channels, we show that, a 4-bit feedback achieves about 90% of the secrecy capacity when perfect main CSI is available at the transmitter. Finally, asymptotic analysis at high and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is presented. It is found that the capacity is bounded at high-SNR, whereas at asymptotically low-SNR, the lower bounds and the upper bound scale linearly with SNR under STPC. Furthermore, subject to LTPC, the capacity at low-SNR is equal to the capacity of the main channel without secrecy constraint and with perfect CSI at both the transmitter and the receiver, under a mild condition on the fading statistics. We also show that a positive secrecy rate is achievable even when the feedback is at the end of each coherence block and q=1.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.041014.131593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6836134/06799317.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6836134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.041014.131593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3364","endPage":"3379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic Secret Message Capacity of the Wiretap Channel with Finite-Rate Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic Secret Message Capacity of the Wiretap Channel with Finite-Rate Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799317/","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6799317/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14396514","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic Secret Message Capacity of the Wiretap Channel with Finite-Rate Feedback","sourcePdf":"3364-tw1406-rezki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095013S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6836134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6836134","articleId":"6799317","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799319,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6799319/6799319-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Kai Wen (S'00-M'04) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.

In the cooperative downlink, zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) with a simple scheduler is well known to obtain nearly the performance of the capacity-achieving dirty-paper coding. However, the centralized ZFBF approach is prohibitively complex as the network size grows. In this paper, we devise message passing algorithms for realizing the regularized ZFBF (RZFBF) in a distributed manner using belief propagation. In the proposed methods, the overall computational cost is decomposed into many smaller computation tasks carried out by groups of neighboring BSs and communication is only required between neighboring BSs. More importantly, some exchanged messages can be computed based on channel statistics rather than instantaneous channel state information, leading to significant reduction in computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms converge quickly to the exact RZFBF and much faster compared to conventional methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799319/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"14299567","publicationDate":"May 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799319/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Message Passing Algorithm for Distributed Downlink Regularized Zero-Forcing Beamforming with Cooperative Base Stations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message Passing Algorithm for Distributed Downlink Regularized Zero-Forcing Beamforming with Cooperative Base Stations","sourcePdf":"2920-tw1405-wen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113674S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6799319","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799320,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Razi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6799320/6799320-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abolfazl Razi is a postdoctoral researcher in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Duke University.

A low-complexity Distributed Joint Source Channel Coding (D-JSCC) based on the Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Codes (PCCC) is implemented in a cluster of sensors in a distributed fashion. Convergence of the iterative decoder is analyzed by utilizing EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart technique to determine the convergence region in terms of the sensors observation accuracy and channel SNR, where the iterative decoder outperforms the non-iterative one. This leads to design of a bi-modal decoder that adaptively switches between the iterative and non-iterative modes in order to avoid inefficient iterative information exchange without compromising the resulting Bit Error Rate (BER). This adaptive decoding algorithm saves the computational power and decoding time by a factor of about 10 by avoiding unnecessary iterations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Iterative Decoding for Binary CEO Problem","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.041014.130921","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06799320.pdf","startPage":"2944","endPage":"2954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.041014.130921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Iterative Decoding for Binary CEO Problem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6799320/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence Analysis of Iterative Decoding for Binary CEO Problem","sourcePdf":"2944-tw1405-razi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068999S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6799320","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6799322,"authors":[{"name":"Kongtao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, P.

In this paper, we contribute to the design and theoretical understanding of push-based content delivery in a converged broadcasting and cellular network to relieve the burden. Specifically, we are interested in analyzing the scheme in which the most popular contents are pushed through broadcasting to alleviate the cellular data bottleneck. This strategy not only offloads the multimedia traffics from the cellular network, but also improves the user experience by eliminating download waiting time. To evaluate the performance gains of the converged network, we first develop a mathematic framework to model the converged network, the multimedia content characteristics and the mobile user behaviors. The improvement of the network capacity is then derived and quantified theoretically. Furthermore, we obtain valuable insights on the impact of the network resource and parameters on the system performance. Numerical results are provided to confirm the accuracy of the developed analytical results and to show the significant performance advantages of the converged network over the cellular-only network in terms of the system power consumption and users' quality of service (QoS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"13","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14299566","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799322/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Push-Based Wireless Converged Networks for Massive Multimedia Content Delivery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Push-Based Wireless Converged Networks for Massive Multimedia Content Delivery","sourcePdf":"2894-tw1405-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08409S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6799322","onlineDate":"16 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6799334,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Then an artificial neural network is trained according dataset obtained offline in GA to determine switching angles and shoot through duty cycle adaptively according variation of input voltages. In this method fundamental component of AC voltage is kept constant in variation of input voltage while low order harmonics is eliminated. The proposed method is verified using simulation in MATLAB/Simulink.","doi":"10.1109/PEDSTC.2014.6799381","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","publicationTitle":"The 5th Annual International Power Electronics, Drive Systems and Technologies Conference (PEDSTC 2014)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDSTC.2014.6799381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799324","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th Annual International Power Electronics, Drive Systems and Technologies Conference (PEDSTC 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783962/6799324/06799381.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive harmonic elimination in a five level z-source inverter using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799381/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive harmonic elimination in a five level z-source inverter using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799381/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254169","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"5-6 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive harmonic elimination in a five level z-source inverter using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076281S","chronDate":"5-6 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783962","isNumber":"6799324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783962","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6799324","articleId":"6799381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799393,"authors":[{"name":"Aram Khodamoradi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Aram","lastName":"Khodamoradi","id":"37085349202"},{"name":"Hossein Kazemi Kargar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Kazemi Kargar","id":"37087341694"},{"name":"Alireza Nateghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Nateghi","id":"37991918900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3479-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3478-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799393","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical models","Predictive models","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","low-pass filters","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind speed modelling","high-frequency damping effect","experimental data","wind direction","wind velocity","islanded wind turbine","wind penetration","wind speed forecasting method","mean speed","turbulence components","rotor","low-pass shaping filter","MATLAB codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power spectral density","shaping filter","turbulence component","wind modelling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799393","doi":"10.1109/PEDSTC.2014.6799393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDSTC.2014.6799393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799324","publicationTitle":"The 5th Annual International Power Electronics, Drive Systems and Technologies Conference (PEDSTC 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th Annual International Power Electronics, Drive Systems and Technologies Conference (PEDSTC 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783962/6799324/06799393.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind speed modelling considering high-frequency damping effect based on experimental data","abstract":"Changes in the velocity and direction of wind, causes to change in the turbine input power and in turn, affects the operation of the system, for instance; output voltage, power and torque of an islanded wind turbine changes proportional to wind speed variations. Therefore, accurate and reliable forecasting systems for wind speed are widely recognized as a major contribution for increasing wind penetration. This paper provides a wind speed forecasting method in order to analysis and modelling the behaviour of wind. Wind speed is first modelled considering superposition of mean speed and turbulence components then the effect of the rotor as a low- pass shaping filter is studied. This procedure could be implemented on a wind turbine simulator on account of numerical and experimental results. Finally the outcome model is applied to the wind turbine and then all procedure is simulated using MATLAB codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-6 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799393/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254239","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wind speed modelling considering high-frequency damping effect based on experimental data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind speed modelling considering high-frequency damping effect based on experimental data","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055542S","chronDate":"5-6 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783962","isNumber":"6799324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783962","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6799324","articleId":"6799393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6799396,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These small sensor nodes are capable of sensing, computing, and communicating. Even though their capabilities are limited, their overall behaviour is complex. For decades researchers all over the world have been working on realizing many applications for wireless sensor networks and trying to overcome their issues. As in any new technology several challenges stand as a barrier to the advancement of wireless sensor networks. One important challenge is power consumption since the expected life of a wireless sensor network is determined by the lifetime of its components. In this paper we propose a modification to the Reed-Solomon decoder algorithm in order to reduce its power consumption and thus improve the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. The proposed modification exploits the fact that there exist applications that tolerate errors without totally jeopardizing the integrity of the data. This opens the door for new type of error control codes, namely error-tolerant non-binary error correction codes. Here we explore the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of bit error rate and symbol error rate in comparison to the original algorithm and uncoded data. Also we provide a power saving estimate resulting from implementing such an algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799477","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799477.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-tolerant non-binary error correction code for low power wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Error-tolerant non-binary error correction code for low power wireless sensor networks","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799477/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14265048","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-tolerant non-binary error correction code for low power wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"O1005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038466S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6799484,"authors":[{"name":"Cuong T.

Results indicate that the performance of the FUEs depends on not only the interference constraint of the MBS but also the delay constraint of the FUEs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control under QoS and interference constraint in Femtocell cognitive networks","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799484","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799484.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Power control under QoS and interference constraint in Femtocell cognitive networks","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799484/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254132","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control under QoS and interference constraint in Femtocell cognitive networks","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"O11001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091791S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6799489,"authors":[{"name":"Junyeong Bok","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Korea"],"lastName":"Junyeong Bok","id":"37843145100"},{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Gyoon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37278285300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3689-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"6799489","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Dual band","Bit error rate","OFDM","MIMO","Degradation","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency synthesizers","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise suppression","dual-band MIMO-OFDM","CA schemes","carrier aggregation schemes","multiple antenna techniques","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","communication capacity","multiband system","multiple-input multiple-output technique","wideband frequency synthesizer","broadband frequency synthesizer","critical impairment","intercarrier interferences","IQ imbalance compensation technique","LTE-advanced system","BER performance improvement","concurrent suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier aggregation","dual band","phase noise","IQ imbalance","LTE-Advanced"]}],"abstract":"Carrier aggregation (CA) schemes and multiple antenna techniques are used for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in order to highly improve the communication capacity in LTE-advanced. In order to implement the multi-band system based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, a wideband frequency synthesizer is required. But, when using broadband frequency synthesizer, serious phase noise problem occurs at the transceiver. In addition, when using MIMO scheme, IQ imbalance is a critical impairment as it causes inter carrier interferences (ICI), that results in severe degradation of the receive performance. Therefore, a joint phase noise and IQ imbalance compensation technique is needed at the receiver for LTE-advanced system with CA and MIMO. In this article, we analyze the effects of the phase noise and IQ imbalance in dual band MIMO-OFDM system, and propose a novel compensation scheme in order to enhance the system performance. From the simulation results, it can be seen that phase noise and IQ imbalance cause serious performance degradation of dual-band MIMO-OFDM system, and the proposed schemes has significantly improved BER performance by concurrent suppression of ICI due to phase noise and IQ imbalance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and suppression of phase noise and IQ imbalance for dual-band MIMO-OFDM","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799489","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799489.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and suppression of phase noise and IQ imbalance for dual-band MIMO-OFDM","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799489/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254130","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and suppression of phase noise and IQ imbalance for dual-band MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"O12001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054651S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6799490,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["Ericsson (China) Communications Co.

Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) has the potential to improve uplink capacity and reduce inter-cell interference by jointly processing the received signals from more antennas of the adjacent nodes, which is one of the key technologies of LTE Advanced system. Uplink CoMP is implemented at the eNodeB side with no requirement on terminals or protocols and thus is easy be introduced in the current network. This paper introduces LTE uplink CoMP principles, use cases and recent field trial results in the TD-LTE networks. The field trial results showed that when there is no interference, uplink CoMP gain at the cell border is 20~40%, the lower working point, the larger improvement. When there is interference, uplink CoMP gain at the cell border is 50~100%.

Inverter is developed with three level techniques. Maximum power tracking of panel power is done by constructing artificial neural network. System performance is measured in terms of the efficiency of the MPPT controller and flexibility in the inverter operation for standalone load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799516/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254359","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799516/","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network MPPT control scheme with hysteresis current controlled inverter for photovoltaic system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network MPPT control scheme with hysteresis current controlled inverter for photovoltaic system","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"162camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070005S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799518,"authors":[{"name":"A.S Kang","affiliation":["ECE Deptt UIET, Panjab University Regional Centre, Hoshiarpur, Punjab, INDIA"],"firstName":"A.S","lastName":"Kang","id":"37304740600"},{"name":"Renu Vig","affiliation":["ECE Deptt UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh, INDIA"],"firstName":"Renu","lastName":"Vig","id":"37721596100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2291-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2290-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799518","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Abstracts","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Multimedia communication","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel bank filters","cognitive radio","communication complexity","digital signal processing chips","fading channels","frequency allocation","quadrature amplitude modulation","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity analysis","FBMC","OQAM","strategic conditions","wireless communication network","frequency spectrum band allocation","intelligent communication system","adaptive communication system","reconfigurable communication system","resource allocation","cognitive radio","software defined radio","ubiquitous situation","radio spectrum sensing","vacant channel availability","secondary users","multicarrier communication system","digital signal processing","bandwidth efficiency","spectral efficiency","overlapping factor variation","filter bank multicarrier approach","orthogonal quadrature amplitude modulation","WGN fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","FBMC","Overlapping Factor","Polyphase Structure"]}],"abstract":"The wireless communication has undergone a revolution due to advancements in technology. For each new user or application to be a part of communication network, the preliminary requirement is the allocation of frequency spectrum band. This frequency band is a limited resource and it is impossible to expand its boundaries. So the need is to employ intelligent, adaptive and reconfigurable communication systems which can investigate the requirements of the end user and assign the requisite resources in contrast to the traditional communication systems which allocate a fixed amount of resource to the user under adaptive, autonomic and opportunistic cognitive radio environment. Cognitive Radio (CR) Technology has emerged from software defined radios wherein the key parameters of interest are frequency, power and modulation technique adopted. The Role of Cognitive Radio is to alter these parameters under ubiquitous situations. The Spectrum Sensing is an important task to determine the availability of the vacant channels to be utilized by the secondary users without posing any harmful interference to the primary users. In Multicarrier Communication System using Digital Signal Processing Techniques, Filter Bank Multi Carrier has an edge over other technologies in terms of Bandwidth and Spectral Efficiency. The present paper deals with Computational Complexity Analysis of FBMC-OQAM under different Strategic Conditions. The study comprises of the effect of variation of overlapping factor and the number of sub-carriers used in Filter Bank Multicarrier approach with Orthogonal Quadrature Amplitude Modulation pre and post processing techniques for the physical layer of Cognitive Radio under AWGN fading channel environment.","doi":"10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799518","publicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784146/6799496/06799518.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Complexity Analysis of FBMC-OQAM under different Strategic Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799518/","displayDocTitle":"Computational Complexity Analysis of FBMC-OQAM under different Strategic Conditions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14254447","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799518/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Complexity Analysis of FBMC-OQAM under different Strategic Conditions","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"164camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052102S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6799528,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Saroha","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, M.M.

Due to the process variations like threshold voltage variations, supply voltage variations etc. in scaled technologies, stable operation of the bit cell is critical to obtain with high yield in low-voltage SRAM. Proposed design enhanced the read stability by using Buffered Read scheme which decouples SRAM cell nodes from the bit-line. It also improves the write ability by dynamic mechanism of cutting off the feedback loop of the inverter pair. Proposed 8T SRAM cell uses a single bit-line scheme to perform the write and read operation. This reduces half of the power dissipation during pre-charging or discharging bit-line as compared to conventional 6T SRAM cell. The simulation results show that the SE 8T SRAM cell achieves 6.5 x Read noise margin, 1.7 x Write-1 ability, and 1.11 x Write-0 ability as compared with conventional 6T SRAM Cell at 0.9V. Read power dissipation and Static power dissipation have also been reduced.","publicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784146/6799496/06799580.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799580","doi":"10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Single Ended 8T SRAM with improved Noise Margins and stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Single Ended 8T SRAM with improved Noise Margins and stability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799580/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799580/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14254327","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Single Ended 8T SRAM with improved Noise Margins and stability","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"328camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076988S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6799589,"authors":[{"name":"Dipti Bhatnagar","affiliation":["N.

Although number of CS measurements are small but the result obtained is acceptable because the image data is analyzed by Human Visual System (HVS) which is less sensitive to high frequency information that can be reduced significantly. Compressive Sensing alone cannot achieve much, so Vector Quantization (VQ) has been used with it and its implementation gives efficient results. This paper presents a CS-VQ based image compression algorithm in which a weighted sequence is used to convert the incoming signal into sparse form. The implementation of proposed CS-VQ algorithm gives better results than the existing CS-VQ algorithm in terms of comparison parameters like PSNR and subjective quality of image. The effect of changing the image block size and the contrast of the image, on the PSNR obtained by the proposed CS-VQ algorithm has also been analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799589","publicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784146/6799496/06799589.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression using deterministic Compressive Sensing and Vector Quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799589/","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using deterministic Compressive Sensing and Vector Quantization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14254369","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799589/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using deterministic Compressive Sensing and Vector Quantization","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"353camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079062S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799608,"authors":[{"name":"Bharti Wadhwa","affiliation":["University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Bharti","lastName":"Wadhwa","id":"37085357140"},{"name":"Amandeep Verma","affiliation":["University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Amandeep","lastName":"Verma","id":"37085368400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2291-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2290-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799608","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1081},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Energy consumption","Resource management","Energy efficiency","Green products","Virtualization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","energy conservation","green computing","power aware computing","processor scheduling","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy saving approach","green cloud computing","IT companies","cost saving benefits","energy efficient cloud computing","virtual machine scheduling","virtual machine migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Energy efficiency","Green Cloud Computing","Virtualization"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing is an emerging technology and is being used by more and more IT companies due to its cost saving benefits and ease of use for users.

Large scale scientific applications are often expressed as Workflows. Workflow tasks should be scheduled efficiently such that execution time as well as cost incurred by using a set of heterogeneous resources over cloud should be minimized. In this paper, we propose Bi-Criteria Priority based Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) to schedule workflow tasks over the available cloud resources that minimized the execution cost and the execution time under given the deadline and budget constraints. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulation with four different real world workflow applications and comparison is done with Budget Constrained Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (BHEFT) and standard PSO. The simulation results show that our scheduling algorithm significantly decreasing the execution cost of schedule as compared to BHEFT and PSO under the same Deadline and Budget Constraint and using same pricing model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14254324","htmlLink":"/document/6799614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bi-Criteria Priority based Particle Swarm Optimization workflow scheduling algorithm for cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Criteria Priority based Particle Swarm Optimization workflow scheduling algorithm for cloud","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"396camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098427S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799622,"authors":[{"name":"Anuradha","affiliation":["ME, ECE, PU, Chandigarh, India"],"lastName":"Anuradha","id":"37086791619"},{"name":"Naresh Kumar","affiliation":["ECE, PU, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Naresh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085591373"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2291-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2290-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799622","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":949},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Modulation","Bit error rate","Wavelet transforms","Signal to noise ratio","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","discrete Fourier transforms","error statistics","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","bit error rate analysis","conventional OFDM","wavelet based OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","LTE","modulation techniques","MIMO","multiple input and multiple output","4th Generation Long Term Evolution","orthogonality loss","intercarrier interference","ICI","intersymbol interference","ISI","cyclic prefixing","CP","spectrum efficiency","discrete Fourier transform","DFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","OFDM","DFT","Wavelet","BER"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) are two main techniques employed in 4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n Generation Long Term Evolution (LTE). In OFDM multiple carriers are used and it provides higher level of spectral efficiency as compared to Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM). In OFDM because of loss of orthogonality between the subcarriers there is intercarrier interference (ICI) and intersymbol interference (ISI) and to overcome this problem use of cyclic prefixing (CP) is required, which uses 20% of available bandwidth. Wavelet based OFDM provides good orthogonality and with its use Bit Error Rate (BER) is improved. Wavelet based system does not require cyclic prefix, so spectrum efficiency is increased.

This way we are able to select support vector machines and neural networks in machine learning where one technique is support for other technique.","doi":"10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799642","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784146/6799496/06799642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","publicationTitle":"2014 Recent Advances in Engineering and Computational Sciences (RAECS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing neural network training data using support vectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reducing neural network training data using support vectors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14254432","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799642/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing neural network training data using support vectors","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"62camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05043S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6799647,"authors":[{"name":"Mohit Arora","affiliation":["ECE Department, Chandigarh University, Gharuan, INDIA"],"firstName":"Mohit","lastName":"Arora","id":"37085768969"},{"name":"Kulbir Singh","affiliation":["ECE Department, Thapar University, Patiala, INDIA"],"firstName":"Kulbir","lastName":"Singh","id":"37594169700"},{"name":"Guneet Mander","affiliation":["ECE Department, Chandigarh University, Gharuan, INDIA"],"firstName":"Guneet","lastName":"Mander","id":"37086651333"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2291-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2290-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799647","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Feature extraction","Trajectory","Handwriting recognition","Fluctuations","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","feature extraction","handwritten character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete fractional cosine transform","online handwritten signature verification","DFrCT tool","feature extraction","FIR systems","Euclidean norms","equal error rate","EER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signature Verification","Online Handwritten Signature","finite impulse response (FIR) system","discrete fractional cosine transformation (DFrCT)"]}],"abstract":"The new method for an online handwritten signature verification based on discrete fractional cosine transformation (DFrCT) for feature extraction is proposed. Various characteristics of the hand-written signature are used to extract different features of the signature. The system for the hand-written signature verification is realized by characterizing three FIR systems. The impulse responses of FIR systems are used to calculate Euclidean norm. The signature can be verified by evaluating the difference between the average of Euclidean norms of reference signatures and the Euclidean norm of signature to be verified. The equal error rate (EER) is calculated to compare the efficiency of the proposed method. It has been verified through simulation results that the DFrCT tool achieves much better results as compared to discrete cosine transform (DCT) for extracting the features.

This problem is increasing exponentially day by day so to deal with this problem we devise an adaptive traffic signal controller (TSC) as traditional traffic signal controllers are inefficient in dealing with increasing demands of growing traffic. This controller uses neural network (NN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to adapt the traffic signal timings according to the congestion. NN takes signal timings as input and gives the queue length as output. GA is further applied to get the optimized green signal timing at its output, which is capable of reducing the queue length and overall delay. The performance of proposed model is also compared with fixed time TSC and an already existing adaptive TSC and a significant improvement were observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254340","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799655/","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive traffic lights based on hybrid of neural network and genetic algorithm for reduced traffic congestion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive traffic lights based on hybrid of neural network and genetic algorithm for reduced traffic congestion","confLoc":"Chandigarh, India","sourcePdf":"87camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041488S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6784146","isNumber":"6799496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784146","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6799496","articleId":"6799655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799662,"authors":[{"name":"Jhu-Jyun Jheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Ilan University, I-Lan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jhu-Jyun Jheng","id":"37087339193"},{"name":"Fan-Hsun Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fan-Hsun Tseng","id":"37087338021"},{"name":"Han-Chieh Chao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Ilan University, I-Lan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Han-Chieh Chao","id":"37087146125"},{"name":"Li-Der Chou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li-Der Chou","id":"37087177111"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3689-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"6799662","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":697},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799662","abstract":"In recent years, the resource demands in cloud environment have been increased incrementally.

Firstly, we utilize the time-dependent of workload at the same period in every day, and forecast the VM workload tendency towards increasing or decreasing. Next, we compare the predicted value with previous time period on workload usage, then determine to migrate which VM wherein the physical machine (PM) for the balanced workload and lower power consumption. The simulation results show that our proposed method not only uses the fewer data to predict the workload accurately but also allocates the resource of VMs with power saving.","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799662","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799662.pdf","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel VM workload prediction using Grey Forecasting model in cloud data center","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Predictive models","Power demand","Arrays","Random access memory","History","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","power aware computing","resource allocation","telecommunication power management","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VM workload prediction","grey forecasting model","cloud data center","resource allocation","virtual machines","VM allocation","power consumption reduction","VM workload tendency","physical machine","PM","power saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud data center","workload prediction","grey interval forecasting","VM migration","power consumption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A novel VM workload prediction using Grey Forecasting model in cloud data center","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254128","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel VM workload prediction using Grey Forecasting model in cloud data center","confLoc":"Phuket","sourcePdf":"O2003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058219S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6799675,"authors":[{"name":"Atchareeya Kongbuntad","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Atchareeya","lastName":"Kongbuntad","id":"37086686118"},{"name":"Monthippa Uthansakul","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Monthippa","lastName":"Uthansakul","id":"37279117800"},{"name":"Peerapong Uthansakul","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Peerapong","lastName":"Uthansakul","id":"37279043200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3689-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"6799675","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Standards","Interference","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","error statistics","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiGig","maximal ratio combining","IEEE 802.Had standard","market demands","data rate communications","beam formation","interference signal mitigation","signal loss","beamforming codebook","BER","beam intersection","computer simulation","beamforming codebook","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","beamforming","codebook","IEEE 802.11ad","WiGig"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799675","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799675","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","abstract":"IEEE 802.11ad standard, so called WiGig has been defined due to the increasing market demands for high data rate communications.

The computer simulation reveals lower BER when employing the proposed beamforming codebook.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","startPage":"112","endPage":"115","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799675.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved beamforming code book for WiGig using Maximal Ratio Combining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6799675/","displayDocTitle":"Improved beamforming code book for WiGig using Maximal Ratio Combining","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254084","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved beamforming code book for WiGig using Maximal Ratio Combining","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"O4005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058879S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6799676,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abu Hanif","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abu","lastName":"Hanif","id":"38490208000"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea"],"lastName":"Moon Ho Lee","id":"37087151954"},{"name":"Sang Seob Song","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Seob Song","id":"37087329435"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3689-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"6799676","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799676","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Covariance matrices","Contamination","Symmetric matrices","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation scheme","large-scale MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output system","antenna arrays","transmitter-receiver","link reliability","circularly symmetric Gaussian covariance matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-Scale MIMO","Channel Estimation","Pilot Contamination","Circularly Symmetric","Covariance Matrix"]}],"abstract":"With large-scale Multiple-input Multiple-output (MOMO), we think of a system that use antenna arrays with an order of magnitude more elements than in systems being built nowadays, say a hundred antennas or more.

According to various academic and industry surveys, two-tier macrocell-femtocell networks should be the key network architecture to reduce the total power consumption of the MBSs. Also, Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems are expected to improve the network capacity with full mobility. In this paper, an efficient power-saving transmission mechanism is proposed in two-tier LTE macrocell-femtocell networks for dynamically managing transceivers at femtocell BSs (FBSs) to improve the energy-saving performance. The proposed mechanism allows grouped FBSs to smartly activate/deactivate, respectively, based on dynamic traffic loads, to address the energy minimization problem for transceivers at both MBSs and FBSs, while maintaining at a pre-determined data rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed one is able to achieve a much better energy-saving performance, when compared with that of existing approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799687.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient power-saving transmission mechanism in LTE macrocell-femtocell hybrid networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Power demand","Green products","Long Term Evolution","Energy consumption","Transceivers","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","power consumption","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient power-saving transmission mechanism","LTE macrocell-femtocell hybrid networks","access networks","macrocell base station","MBS","green communication","energy consumption","rising energy cost","carbon dioxide emission","total power consumption reduction","Long Term Evolution systems","network capacity","two-tier LTE macrocell-femtocell networks","transceiver dynamic management","femtocell BS","FBS","energy-saving performance","dynamic traffic loads","energy minimization problem","pre-determined data rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Green Networks","Energy-Saving","System Engineering","Intelligent Computing","Hierarchical Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An efficient power-saving transmission mechanism in LTE macrocell-femtocell hybrid networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799687/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14254139","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient power-saving transmission mechanism in LTE macrocell-femtocell hybrid networks","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"O7001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064182S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6799691,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhakim Khlifi","affiliation":["Innov'COM Laboratory, Sup'Com University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Khlifi","id":"37085359901"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["Innov'COM Laboratory, Sup'Com University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37085336187"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3689-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"6799691","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799691","abstract":"The traditional Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) channel estimation technique costs O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) floating operations and O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) memory locations where N represents the channel autocorrelation matrix order.

source number estimation for cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio (CR) network operating on a spectrum reserved for licensed primary user (PU) by employing spatial spectrum sharing (SS). When the secondary users (SUs) are equipped with multiple antennas, they can perform SS without interfering with the PU by orthogonalizing the secondary transmission with the interference channel . In order to avoid interference and to maximize the capacity of the secondary transmissions, it is essential that the SUs determine the dimension of the orthogonal transmission space. In CR networks where no cooperation is provided by the PU, this information can be obtained by estimating the number of primary transmit streams at the secondary terminals. We study this issue when the secondary network performs cooperative estimation by using the minimum description length (MDL) algorithm to obtain the independent estimates and propose a decision fusion rule which takes into account the estimation bias of MDL. We will show that the proposed method can outperform conventional decision fusion rule and that it provides additional protection for the PU in the case of estimation error.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799713/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14254137","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799713/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative source number estimation for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative source number estimation for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"P02004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041919S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799714,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Pham","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"lastName":"Chuan Pham","id":"37085390312"},{"name":"Nguyen H.

Due to the randomness of the appearance of Primary users, disruptions to communications of Secondary users are often difficult to prevent and lead to low throughput of CRN.

Thus, the utility company adopts different price of electricity at each time slot considering the peak time. This paper presents a new power consumption scheduling algorithm for smart buildings that adopts smart meters and real-time pricing of electricity. The proposed algorithm dynamically changes the power mode of each electric device according to the change of electricity prices. Specifically, we formulate the electricity usage scheduling problem as a real-time task scheduling problem, and show that it is a complex search problem that has an exponential time complexity. The proposed scheme uses an efficient heuristic based on genetic algorithms to cut down the huge searching space and finds a reasonable schedule within a feasible time budget. Experimental results with various building conditions show that the proposed algorithm reduces the electricity charge of a smart building by 25.6% on average and up to 33.4%.","doi":"10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799726","startPage":"469","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799467","displayPublicationTitle":"The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6783960/6799467/06799726.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm based power consumption scheduling in smart grid buildings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799726/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm based power consumption scheduling in smart grid buildings","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799726/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254086","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm based power consumption scheduling in smart grid buildings","confLoc":"Phuket","sourcePdf":"P04001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044935S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6783960","isNumber":"6799467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6783960","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6799467","articleId":"6799726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6799743,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wu","affiliation":["System & Technology Region North East Asia, Ericsson"],"lastName":"Yi Wu","id":"37087878194"},{"name":"Peter Butovitsch","affiliation":["System & Technology Region North East Asia, Ericsson"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Butovitsch","id":"38132344600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3689-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"6799743","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Buildings","Downlink","Uplink","Interference","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TD-LTE small cell deployment study","indoor network planning","network capacity performance","varying cell densities","system-level simulations","traffic load","downlink performance","intercell interference","uplink performance","cell densification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor small cell","Cellular Networks","LTE","Densification","Performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799743","abstract":"An indoor network planning for large buildings is studied in this paper, where the cells are continuously added in order to increase the total network capacity.

Both numerical and simulation results show that all of our modified energy detectors outperform the conventional total energy detector. Decision fusion of the local binary hard decisions made at the sample partitions is also considered to provide a greater flexibility for the PU signal protection and/or to improve the detection performance of the stand-alone energy detector. The efficacy of cooperative spectrum sensing using the average energy detector is also studied.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN

multiplexing (OFDM) system, channel estimation is significant in that it affects the reliability of coherent detection at the receiver. Compressive sensing based channel estimation demands fewer pilots than traditional methods and improves the resource utilization in a great manner. Greedy algorithms have a weakness in terms of anti-noise capacity. Combining compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) with exponential smoothing, an improved reconstruction method is proposed in order to suppress noise. The noise suppression capacity of exponential smoothing is analyzed in theory. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is superior to CoSaMP especially for high noise or low speed situation at a cost of low additional computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799777","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799777.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved reconstruction method for compressive sensing based OFDM channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799777/","displayDocTitle":"An improved reconstruction method for compressive sensing based OFDM channel estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254761","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799777/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved reconstruction method for compressive sensing based OFDM channel estimation","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p100li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070384S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799784,"authors":[{"name":"Siva Teja Patibandla","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Siva Teja","lastName":"Patibandla","id":"37086662151"},{"name":"Tim Bakker","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Bakker","id":"37086215990"},{"name":"Robert H.

broadcast real-time message to desired direction with lane-level accuracy which is much more low cost and effective than traditional method or other communication systems with complex antenna array. This system can be used to lane associates management in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), including temporary stop warning, on-coming traffic warning, electronic brake warning, and lane-level traffic control. The system uses a pair of symmetric transmitters which is evolved from the structure of out-phasing modulator to `select' a special zone by beam-forming. The main advantages of the proposed method over other potential technologies such as wireless sign, smart antenna and display board are its adaptability for bad climate and compatibility to on board unite (OBU) in vehicular communication system. Key technical points of the proposed technology are analyzed by simulation, and the results of designed application scenes show the acceptable performance and confirm the viability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799786/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14254749","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799786/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A lane-level broadcasting scheme using beam-forming for Intelligent Transportation Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lane-level broadcasting scheme using beam-forming for Intelligent Transportation Systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p158du.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119773S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6799797,"authors":[{"name":"Jared Dulmage","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California"],"firstName":"Jared","lastName":"Dulmage","id":"37724936600"},{"name":"Michael P.

Cross-layer design has the potential for more efficient system design than is possible considering each layer in isolation. In this article, we consider goodput optimization of pilot-symbol assisted modulation with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (PSAM-OFDM). Here goodput accounts for both the training overhead at the physical layer (PHY) and re-transmission of lost blocks at the medium access control (MAC) layer. We present a novel formulation of the cross-layer goodput metric using natural extensions of the mean and variance of the mutual information of PSAM-OFDM found in the literature. From this formulation we identify a practical tradeoff between the frequency-diversity offered by a channel and the signal overhead necessary to exploit that diversity. This has direct implications for the optimization of time-scaled OFDM signals (e.g. channelized OFDM). We show that our optimization of channel bandwidth results in higher aggregate goodput than alternatives proposed in the literature. Finally, we show that the conventional optimization of pilot power allocation to maximize physical layer throughput (considering only physical layer overhead) also maximizes the cross-layer goodput.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799797","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799797.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation, overhead, and outage for PSAM-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799797/","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation, overhead, and outage for PSAM-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254737","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799797/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation, overhead, and outage for PSAM-OFDM","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p221dulmage.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050448S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799801,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah M.

Energy efficiency is attained thanks to Large Multiple Input Single Output Beamforming. Robustness to beamforming mispointing at high speed is obtained by using the recent \u201cPredictor Antenna\u201d concept. However, for some speeds, the Separate Receive and Training Antenna technique suffers from residual mispointing. To improve the robustness of this technique, we propose three new schemes: the \u201cBorder Switch Off Scheme\u201d, the \u201cRandom Switch Off Scheme\u201d and the \u201cPolynomial Interpolation\u201d scheme. The two first schemes dynamically mute transmit antennas selectively when the residual mispointing is too severe. The third scheme generalizes the Predictor Antenna concept and uses all antennas upon the vehicle as a Predictor Antenna Array. These schemes are here assessed over spatially correlated channels. The two first schemes reduce energy saving to slightly improve robustness, whereas the third scheme perfectly compensates all speeds up to 300 kmph with maximum energy saving, at the cost of extra complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799816","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799816.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive large MISO downlink with Predictor Antenna array for very fast moving vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive large MISO downlink with Predictor Antenna array for very fast moving vehicles","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6799816/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254713","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799816/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive large MISO downlink with Predictor Antenna array for very fast moving vehicles","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p331phanhuy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119977S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6799818,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Endo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Endo","id":"37086761087"},{"name":"Shinichi Miyamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"Miyamoto","id":"37347266400"},{"name":"Seiichi Sampei","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Sampei","id":"38262497100"},{"name":"Wenjie Jiang","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37273927600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2491-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-1289"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-1297"}],"articleNumber":"6799818","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"To enhance the throughput of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless local area network (WLAN) systems, this paper proposes a stations-clustering strategy in which stations in the basic service set (BSS) are grouped into clusters.

After that, the AP calculates the expected throughput for all clustered-patterns and chooses a clustered-pattern that maximizes the expected throughput. Then, the stations are grouped into clusters in accordance with the selected clustered-pattern, and the stations within the same cluster share the radio resource by OFDMA WLAN scheme. Numerical simulation confirms that the proposed scheme can maximize throughput performance by introduction of dynamic station clustering in the single BSS environment and it is also effective in preventing channel state information (CSI) feedback blocking due to station exposition in the overlapping BSS environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799818.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"349","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Station clustering strategy for DCF-based centralized OFDMA WLAN systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wireless LAN","Interference","Media Access Protocol","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","pattern clustering","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["station clustering strategy","DCF-based centralized OFDMA WLAN systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wireless local area network system","basic service set","BSS","access point","AP","transmit DATA frames","clustered-pattern","numerical simulation","dynamic station clustering","channel state information","CSI feedback","distributed coordination function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Station clustering strategy for DCF-based centralized OFDMA WLAN systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254768","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Station clustering strategy for DCF-based centralized OFDMA WLAN systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p343endo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048689S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799836,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It has been found that on average, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm covers less ground than the Random Search but detects more targets, indicating the effectiveness of the heuristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799836/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14254666","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799836/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An autonomous air-sea rescue system using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An autonomous air-sea rescue system using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p459rafferty.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067752S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6799849,"authors":[{"name":"Dazhi Piao","affiliation":["Communication University of China, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Dazhi","lastName":"Piao"},{"name":"Yi Mao","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Communication University of China, Beijing, P.

One consists of two modified printed loop (MM) antennas with ideal impedance matching and port isolation, which can provide a wide bandwidth of 750 MHz. The simulated isolation between the two loops was -30 dB or less within 2.25-3.0 GHz. The other one is composed of an electric dipole and a magnetic dipole (EM), and ideal port isolation (better than -60 dB) is achieved within the entire band of 1.5-3.5 GHz. Computation results show that in the free space channel, a nearly twofold capacity gain can be obtained over the one-polarized single-input-single-output (SISO) system for both of the two dual-polarized antennas. The capacity gain obtained by the MM antennas is 1.975 and by the EM antennas its 1.995, for the communication distance larger than 0.1 m. In the ground reflected channel, the maximum capacity gain close to 2 can also be obtained for both of the two dual-polarized MIMO antennas, however, the capacity gains fluctuate with the communication distance. We get the conclusion that the characteristics of the multipolarized MIMO system is not only influenced by the antenna properties, but also influenced strongly by the propagation characteristics of the channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799850","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799850.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two novel colocated dual-polarized antennas with extremely low mutual coupling for polarization diversity MIMO applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799850/","displayDocTitle":"Two novel colocated dual-polarized antennas with extremely low mutual coupling for polarization diversity MIMO applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254744","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799850/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two novel colocated dual-polarized antennas with extremely low mutual coupling for polarization diversity MIMO applications","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p531piao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043254S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799878,"authors":[{"name":"Md Zunayeed Kamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Md Zunayeed","lastName":"Kamal","id":"37086777389"},{"name":"Arshad M Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Arshad M","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37279264600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2491-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-1289"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-1297"}],"articleNumber":"6799878","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Optical distortion","Optical transmitters","Estimation","Optical amplifiers","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing","OFDM modulation","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak to average power ratio reduction","OFDM","optical-wireless-access networks","blind symbol power estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based optical wireless transport system","analog to digital converter circuitry","ADC","DAC","amplifier nonlinearity","optical transport system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Peak-to-Average-Power Ratio (PAPR)","Threshold power or threshold power level","Power scaling factor"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based optical wireless transport system suffers from high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) as it essentially increases the complexity of analog to digital converter circuitry (ADC and DAC), introduces significant distortion of amplifier nonlinearity and gain saturation at high input power.

Most current proposals for V2V and V2I use DSRC and a dedicated infrastructure of road side units (RSUs) for the V2I scenarios. Here, the technical feasibility of an alternative architecture is explored, one that uses a combination of LTE cellular networks and servers near the edge of the LTE network. Compared with approaches based on DSRC and RSUs, this architecture exploits an infrastructure that is already largely deployed, but requires that technical challenges related to latency and scalability be addressed. This paper outlines an architecture that addresses these challenges and shows experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness for vehicular safety applications. The approach combines resources near the network edge with broadcast-based data distribution to provide data freshness guarantees comparable to what can be achieved with DSRC for many applications. Experiments from the deployed LTE network and NS-3 simulations demonstrate that this approach is feasible, and show the benefits and limitations of the architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799889","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799889.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling vehicular safety applications over LTE networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799889/","displayDocTitle":"Enabling vehicular safety applications over LTE networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254803","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799889/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling vehicular safety applications over LTE networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p747kato.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150866S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6799899,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Jeanne","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Jeanne","id":"37671507000"},{"name":"Michel Asselman","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Asselman","id":"37086682108"},{"name":"Bert den Brinker","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bert","lastName":"den Brinker","id":"37086496991"},{"name":"Murtaza Bulut","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Murtaza","lastName":"Bulut","id":"37086682254"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2491-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-1289"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-1297"}],"articleNumber":"6799899","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Monitoring","Vehicles","Skin","Biomedical measurement","Heart rate measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical imaging","biomedical measurement","blood flow measurement","cardiology","image colour analysis","image sensors","infrared imaging","medical computing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera-based heart rate monitoring","highly dynamic light conditions","biomedical engineering","RGB cameras","minute skin color changes","periodic blood flow","infrared-based alternative","light-robust camera-based heart rate measurements","automotive applications","correlation score","reference measurement method","camera-based driver monitoring solutions","eye tracking"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camera-based heart rate monitoring in highly dynamic light conditions","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","endPage":"799","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799899","startPage":"798","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799899","abstract":"Recent advances in biomedical engineering have shown that heart rate can be monitored remotely using regular RGB cameras by analyzing minute skin color changes caused by periodic blood flow.

Unfortunately, channel condition of HSR communication is extremely time-varying due to large Doppler effect from high mobility and fast environments alternating. In this paper, spatial modulation is introduced to HSR communication as a multi-antenna candidate technique for its many advantages. It indicates that high spectral efficiency and good robustness can be achieved by using spatial modulation in HSR communication. Then, we further provide some potential application scenarios for HSR communication system. Numerical results show that spatial modulation with proper receivers outperforms V-BLAST or space-time coding in certain cases. Furthermore, the results validate the potential of spatial modulation applying to HSR communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial modulation in high speed railway communication","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799940","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6784566/6799751/06799940.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Spatial modulation in high speed railway communication","conferenceDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799940/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14254765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial modulation in high speed railway communication","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p955li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121095S","chronDate":"2-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6784566","isNumber":"6799751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6784566","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6799751","articleId":"6799940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6799986,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-9095-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6799986","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Antennas","Dictionaries","Terminology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antennas","definitions","IEEE 145","terms"]}],"abstract":"Definitions for antennas and for systems that incorporate an antenna as a component of the system are established in this standard.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Std 145-2013 (Revision of IEEE Std 145-1993) - Redline","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Std 145-2013 (Revision of IEEE Std 145-1993) - Redline","pdfPath":"/iel7/6799984/6799985/06799986.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"145-2013 - IEEE Standard for Definitions of Terms for Antennas - Redline","versions":[{"evolutions":[{"description":"Revision of ","title":"IEEE Std 145-1993","displayLink":"pubLink","pubNumber":2785}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 6 2014","displayDocTitle":"145-2013 - IEEE Standard for Definitions of Terms for Antennas - Redline","isStandard":true,"standardNumber":"145-2013","purpose":"Many individuals and organizations are involved in the design, manufacture, measurement and use of antennas for many different applications.

The proposed novel algorithm consists of an edge detector, an anisotropic weighting model, and a filter-based compensator. The anisotropic weighting model is designed to catch more information in horizontal than vertical directions. The filter-based compensation methodology includes a Laplacian and spatial sharpening filters, which are developed to improve the edge information and reduce the blurring effect. In addition, the hardware cost was successfully reduced by hardware sharing and reconfigurable design techniques. The VLSI architecture of the proposed design achieves 200 MHz with 5.2-K gate counts, and its core area is 64 236 \u03bcm2 synthesized by a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process. Compared with the previous low-complexity techniques, this paper not only reduces gate counts or power consumption by more than 8% or 91.7%, respectively, but also improves the average color peak signal-to-noise ratio quality by more than 1.6 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2317890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6937229/06799995.pdf","startPage":"1982","endPage":"1991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2317890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6937229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Implementation of an Adaptive Edge-Enhanced Color Interpolation Processor for Real-Time Video Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799995/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of an Adaptive Edge-Enhanced Color Interpolation Processor for Real-Time Video Applications","volume":"24","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6799995/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14700083","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC-101-2221-E-033-066, NSC-102-2221-E-033-063 and NSC-102-2622-E-033-009-CC2"},{"fundingName":"National Chip Implementation Center, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of an Adaptive Edge-Enhanced Color Interpolation Processor for Real-Time Video Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chen-2317890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120514S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6937229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6937229","articleId":"6799995","onlineDate":"17 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6799996,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Martin Ibanez","affiliation":["CEIT, Electronics and Communications, Manuel de Lardizabal, San Sebastian, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6923502/6799996/ibane-small.gif","p":["Federico Martin Ibanez was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1982.\n He received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the National Technological University (UTN), Buenos Aires,\n in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from the University of Navarra, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain.","Since 2006 to 2009, he was part of the Electronics Department, UTN.

This is useful in bidirectional dc/dc converters where one port is attached to a fixed voltage dc line, e.g., a 360-V dc line, and the other port is attached to an energy storage device such as a bank of supercapacitors or batteries. Every converter that works in this scenario requires step-up and step-down modes to transfer energy from one port to the other. The paper presents the SRC as an alternative to the well-known dual active bridge (DAB). The dc analysis is detailed to demonstrate the step-up capability. In addition, the ac analysis is presented. Experimental results from a 6-kW prototype validate the theoretical analysis. The results indicate that this technique achieves better efficiency compared to the phase-shift DAB in a wide power range, from heavy to light loads. The main reason for this is that the converter works with smaller currents than the DAB at light loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6799996/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14665216","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6799996/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Step-Up Bidirectional Series Resonant DC/DC Converter Using a Continuous Current Mode","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Step-Up Bidirectional Series Resonant DC/DC Converter Using a Continuous Current Mode","sourcePdf":"tpel-ibanez-2318202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072755S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6923502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6923502","articleId":"6799996","onlineDate":"17 April 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"}]
