For the application of low-frequency induction logging, the number of iterations is very small (less than eight). Furthermore, the CG-FFHT method only requires the storage of several vectors of dimension N. In this paper we present an improved fast Hankel transform (FHT) algorithm as well as some applications of the CG-FFHT method. It is shown that the improved FHT algorithm results in better accuracy and is more efficient than the other FHT algorithms. Moreover, with this FHT algorithm there is no need to pad the function to be transformed with zeros.

A ray-tracing tool based on geometrical optics and ray density normalization is used for the simulations. The comparisons reveal that an appropriate ray-tracing approach is able to precisely predict wave propagation in curved geometry. It is shown that the actual shape of the boundaries has a major impact on the propagation characteristics compared to, for example, the materials parameters. Furthermore, the effect of the focusing of energy was observed in both measurements and simulations. In this case, the ray density normalization allows us to overcome one of the major disadvantages of conventional geometrical optics: its failure at caustics.","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770070/07770075.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1029/2000RS002586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2000RS002586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing in curved confined spaces: A performance evaluation based on measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Geometry","Antenna measurements","Ray tracing","Probes","Propagation","Geophysical measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["geometrical optics","indoor propagation","measurements","millimeter waves","ray launching","ray tracing","tunnels","wave propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2002","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing in curved confined spaces: A performance evaluation based on measurements","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2002","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing in curved confined spaces: A performance evaluation based on measurements","sourcePdf":"rds4683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033685S","chronDate":"June  2002","isNumber":"7770070","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7770075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770079,"authors":[{"name":"Walther \u00c5sen","affiliation":["Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Walther","lastName":"\u00c5sen"},{"name":"Chris J.

Such fine details constrain the cell size. The corrugated object can be modeled using the asymptotic corrugation boundary condition (ACBC) with a correction due to the width-over-period ratio. The ACBC forces certain field distributions inside the corrugation and allows for the removal of the corrugation teeth to have a homogeneous region with enforced field behavior that represents the actual corrugations. The ACBC approach is found to be accurate when the number of corrugations per wavelength is large (typically around 10 corrugations per wavelength). Computed results using ACBC are in good agreement with detailed simulations, which demonstrates the validity of the asymptotic approximations. Last, a major improvement in the computation time is achieved when using the ACBC to model structures that have a large number of corrugations per wavelength.","doi":"10.1029/2004RS003148","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770132/07770134.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2004RS003148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of the asymptotic corrugation boundary condition in the finite difference time domain method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770134/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of the asymptotic corrugation boundary condition in the finite difference time domain method","volume":"40","issue":"06","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of the asymptotic corrugation boundary condition in the finite difference time domain method","sourcePdf":"rds5149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035064S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","isNumber":"7770132","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7770134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770146,"authors":[{"name":"John McVay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McVay"},{"name":"Ahmad Hoorfar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Hoorfar"},{"name":"Nader Engheta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Engheta"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7770146","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Surface impedance","Surface waves","Bandwidth","Metamaterials","Magnetic materials","Electric fields"]}],"abstract":"Following our previous work on metamaterial high-impedance surfaces made of Hilbert curve inclusions, here we theoretically explore the performance of the high-impedance surfaces made of another form of space-filling curve known as the Peano curve.

To provide global coverage data of soil moisture and ocean salinity with three-day revisit time, the Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) was selected by ESA (European Space Agency) in May 1999. SMOS' single payload is a Y-shaped 2-D aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer called MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis). SMOS presents some particular imaging peculiarities: variation of incidence and azimuth angles, different radiometric sensitivity and accuracy at each direction (pixels), and geometric polarization mixing. Therefore, the accuracy of the geophysical parameter retrieval depends on the knowledge of the angular dependence of the emissivity over a wide range of incidence and azimuth angles. The accuracy of the sea surface salinity retrievals depends on our capability to correct the wind-induced variation of the brightness temperatures. To better understand wind effects, ESA sponsored the WInd and Salinity Experiment 2000 (WISE-2000) from November 15, 2000, to January 16, 2001, in the Casablanca oil rig, at 40 km off the coast of Tarragona (Spain). This paper is divided into two parts. First, it presents the derived sensitivities of the brightness temperatures at vertical and horizontal polarizations with wind speed, and compares to Hollinger's measurements and numerical simulations. Second, these results are applied to the SMOS sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieval problem for different tracks within the swath. It is shown that, except for low SSS and sea surface temperature (SST), the retrieved SSS has a RMS error of approximately 1 psu in one satellite pass.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2002RS002629","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770259/07770269.pdf","startPage":"36-1","endPage":"36-8","doi":"10.1029/2002RS002629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"L-band sea surface emissivity: Preliminary results of the WISE-2000 campaign and its application to salinity retrieval in the SMOS mission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2003","displayDocTitle":"L-band sea surface emissivity: Preliminary results of the WISE-2000 campaign and its application to salinity retrieval in the SMOS mission","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"L-band sea surface emissivity: Preliminary results of the WISE-2000 campaign and its application to salinity retrieval in the SMOS mission","sourcePdf":"rds4836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028904S","chronDate":"Aug.  2003","isNumber":"7770259","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"21","articleId":"7770269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770305,"authors":[{"name":"Michael G.

This inspection was motivated by efforts to establish a ray trace model to characterize indoor radio propagation channels. Eight canonical geometries were examined to isolate near-surface and near-field effects that are not accounted for in the GO approximation. Common building materials and physical dimensions (i.e., antenna separation and height) as small as 1 cm were investigated for frequencies up to 8 GHz. Theoretical fields were calculated via numerical evaluation of Sommerfeld integrals and compared to corresponding GO approximations. As expected, near-field and near-surface (e.g., surface wave) mechanisms which invalidate GO were observed. Close to the surface, an interesting interference pattern in the frequency domain was identified. Mathematical manipulation showed that this so-called \u201cpseudolateral wave\u201d phenomenon was caused by adjacent fields in the two media propagating at different speeds. Next, we transformed the results to the time domain and used delay spread as a metric to quantify GO error. We also show that the pseudolateral wave manifests itself in the time domain as an additional pulse that arrives at a delay associated with the speed of a wave traveling in the lossy media.","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770299/07770305.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"31","doi":"10.1029/2000RS002508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2000RS002508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation into the geometric optics approximation for indoor scenarios with a discussion on pseudolateral waves","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","displayDocTitle":"An investigation into the geometric optics approximation for indoor scenarios with a discussion on pseudolateral waves","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation into the geometric optics approximation for indoor scenarios with a discussion on pseudolateral waves","sourcePdf":"rds4622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024198S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","isNumber":"7770299","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7770305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770311,"authors":[{"name":"James B.

With this information, ray tracing can accurately determine the location of the HF transmitters if the three-dimensional (3-D) electron density (Ne) distribution between the DF site and the transmitters is known. The usual approach is to use an ionospheric model like the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) as a proxy for the density distribution. We describe a more realistic approach developed in cooperation with Codem Systems in Merrimack, New Hampshire. A collocated digisonde at the DF site measures the vertical electron density profile and the local ionospheric tilt, providing, in real time, the inputs for the construction of the 3-D Ne distribution. The vertical profile is automatically obtained from the Automated Real Time Ionogram Scaler with True Height (ARTIST)-scaled ionogram and the local tilt from the sky maps recorded after each ionogram.

When the measured density profile and tilt data are available, the derived 3-D density distribution represents the instantaneous ionosphere structure near the site. The numerical ray tracing includes the effects of the magnetic field and properly treats the spitze effect, making the ray-tracing program especially useful for small distances. Ray tracing through simulated tilts shows that the differences in ground distances for one-hop high-frequency (HF) propagation vary from about 1 to 100 km depending on the assumed tilts and distances. Operational tests for distances up to approximately 100 km have demonstrated good results in determining the transmitter location in real time and have illustrated the importance of using the actual ionospheric profiles and tilts in the ray tracing.","doi":"10.1029/2005RS003378","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770320/07770344.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2005RS003378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time HF ray tracing through a tilted ionosphere","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770344/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time HF ray tracing through a tilted ionosphere","volume":"41","issue":"05","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time HF ray tracing through a tilted ionosphere","sourcePdf":"rds5285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035022S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","isNumber":"7770320","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"7","articleId":"7770344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770368,"authors":[{"name":"Masaharu Fujita","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Fujita"},{"name":"Hisashi Okubo","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisashi","lastName":"Okubo"},{"name":"Yoshiyuki Fujino","affiliation":["Kashima Space Research Center, Communications Research Laboratory, Kashima, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiyuki","lastName":"Fujino"},{"name":"Masato Tanaka","affiliation":["Kashima Space Research Center, Communications Research Laboratory, Kashima, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Tanaka"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7770368","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770368","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Antenna measurements","Radar antennas","Transmitting antennas","Microstrip antennas","Reflector antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polarimetry","Van Atta reflector","radar calibration","calibration target","dual polarization"]}],"abstract":"Polarization-rotating reflectors are important as a reference target for polarimetric calibration of a synthetic aperture radar.

This energy, contained in impulse-like signals called radio atmospherics or sferics, is guided for long distances by multiple reflections from the ground and lower ionosphere. This suggests that observed sferic waveforms radiated from lightning and received at long distances (>1000 km) from the source stroke contain information about the state of the ionosphere along the propagation path. The focus of this work is on the extraction of nighttime D region electron densities (in the altitude range of \u223c70\u201395 km) from observed VLF sferics. In order to accurately interpret observed sferic characteristics, we develop a model of sferic propagation which is based on an existing frequency domain subionospheric VLF propagation code. The model shows that the spectral characteristics of VLF sferics depend primarily on the propagation path averaged ionospheric D region electron density profile, covering the range of electron densities from \u223c 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sup>\n to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22123</sup>\n.

We model broadband ELF sferic waveforms by adapting a single-frequency ELF propagation code to calculate an ELF propagation impulse response under the assumption of horizontal ionospheric homogeneity, with which we extract the source lightning current waveform from an observed ELF sferic waveform using a deconvolution method based on linear regularization. Tests on modeled sferics indicate that the method is accurate and relatively insensitive to noise, and we demonstrate the application of the technique with a sprite-associated sferic. Since ELF sferics can often be observed many thousands of kilometers from the source discharge, the technique developed here represents a powerful new method of remotely sensing lightning current waveforms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2000","volume":"35","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"March-April 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling ELF radio atmospheric propagation and extracting lightning currents from ELF observations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling ELF radio atmospheric propagation and extracting lightning currents from ELF observations","sourcePdf":"rds4335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083198S","chronDate":"March-April  2000","isNumber":"7770605","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"11","articleId":"7770613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7770645,"authors":[{"name":"Ashley B.

To deal with nuisance parameters associated with the position of the object relative to the sensor as well as the object orientation, a computationally tractable physical model explicit in these unknowns is developed. The model is also parameterized by a collection of decay constants (or equivalently Laplace-plane poles) whose values in theory are independent of object position and orientation. These poles are used as features for classification. The overall algorithm consists of two stages. First, we estimate the values of the unknown parameters and then we do classification. Classification is done by comparing either the raw data or some low-dimensional collection of features extracted from the data to entries in a library. The library can be constructed using either simulated or calibration data. A maximum likelihood method is developed and analyzed for the problem of joint pole, location, and orientation parameter determination. Here we examine and compare two classification schemes. The first classification method is based on data residuals generated from estimated signal parameters. This scheme performs well in low SNR cases. The second is based on estimated pole values themselves, which performs well in high SNR cases. We validate our methods on both simulated and field data taken from frequency and time domain sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2004","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical classification of buried objects from spatially sampled time or frequency domain electromagnetic induction data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical classification of buried objects from spatially sampled time or frequency domain electromagnetic induction data","sourcePdf":"rds5039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020426S","chronDate":"Aug.  2004","isNumber":"7770637","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"9","articleId":"7770645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7770649,"authors":[{"name":"Narayan Kovvali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Kovvali"},{"name":"Lawrence Carin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Carin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7770649","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770649","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Synthetic aperture radar","Support vector machines","Landmine detection","Roads","Plastics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar","detection","land mine"]}],"doi":"10.1029/2003RS002967","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770637/07770649.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2003RS002967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of wideband forward looking synthetic aperture radar for sensing land mines","abstract":"Signal processing algorithms are considered for the analysis of wideband, forward looking synthetic aperture radar data and for sensing metal and plastic land mines, with principal application to unpaved roads.

In the scenario where multiple closely spaced subsurface objects are present within the field of view of the sensor, the signals measured using electromagnetic induction sensors are mixed, and the mixed measurements cannot be used to determine the identity of each of the individual objects using conventional techniques. Since only the mixed observations are available, and these are usually available at multiple target/sensor orientations, separating individual signals from the set of mixtures can be posed as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. In this paper we consider two approaches to source separation, one based on the second-order statistics and the other based on the fourth-order statistics. Following the source separation, object classification performance is obtained using the separated sources and a Bayesian classifier. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each BSS approach and compare their performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of closely spaced subsurface objects using electromagnetic induction data and blind source separation algorithms","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1029/2003RS002968","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770637/07770650.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2003RS002968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Classification of closely spaced subsurface objects using electromagnetic induction data and blind source separation algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of closely spaced subsurface objects using electromagnetic induction data and blind source separation algorithms","sourcePdf":"rds5051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042213S","chronDate":"Aug.  2004","isNumber":"7770637","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7770650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770654,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For FDTD subregions, we will either construct a system matrix or we will calculate matrix-vector products directly relying on FDTD. Guidelines will be given to choose the most efficient approach for each FDTD subdomain. To illustrate the efficiency of the new method and to compare the new approach with other (hybrid) methods, three representative configurations are studied.","doi":"10.1029/2001RS002596","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770724/07770725.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2001RS002596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770724","startPage":"4-1","endPage":"4-15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new finite element-FDTD-boundary integral equation technique with biconjugate gradient solver for modeling electromagnetic problems in the frequency domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","displayDocTitle":"A new finite element-FDTD-boundary integral equation technique with biconjugate gradient solver for modeling electromagnetic problems in the frequency domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new finite element-FDTD-boundary integral equation technique with biconjugate gradient solver for modeling electromagnetic problems in the frequency domain","sourcePdf":"rds4816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050381S","chronDate":"Dec.  2003","isNumber":"7770724","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7770725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770751,"authors":[{"name":"Peter R.

A new method introduced by M\u00e4tzler and Wegm\u00fcller [1995] and Weise [1996a] for determining the scattering and absorption behavior of test samples was applied and further developed by application of a multiple scattering model. Homogeneous samples of dry snow were (1) investigated using a set of portable, linearly polarized Dicke radiometers at frequencies of 11, 21, 35, 48 and 94 GHz, (2) characterized by temperature, grain size and shape, density and permittivity, and (3) structurally analyzed by digitized snow sections in order to obtain statistical information of the snow structure i.e. the autocorrelation function. During the winters 1994/1995 and 1995/1996 additional measurements of snow samples were made to extend the variability of the investigated snow types. Up to now, 20 samples, representing alpine snow in winter (that is, without melt metamorphism) have been collected during three winter campaigns. Here, we present the method and the radiative transfer model and show how it can be inverted to obtain scattering and absorption coefficients. A first assessment of the snow sample data is also presented. The results show good agreement between the measured and the theoretical absorption coefficient. The scattering coefficient turns out to be a strong function of frequency and correlation length as expected from Rayleigh scattering. However, distinct differences can be noted.","doi":"10.1029/97RS02746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/97RS02746","startPage":"273","endPage":"289","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770880/07770891.pdf","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiometric and structural measurements of snow samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1998","displayDocTitle":"Radiometric and structural measurements of snow samples","publicationDate":"March-April 1998","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770891/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiometric and structural measurements of snow samples","sourcePdf":"rds4134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017852S","chronDate":"March-April  1998","isNumber":"7770880","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"25","articleId":"7770891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770940,"authors":[{"name":"Fay\u00e7al Rejiba","affiliation":["Department of Applied Geophysics, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, UMR 7619, Sisyphe, CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Fay\u00e7al","lastName":"Rejiba"},{"name":"Christian Camerlynck","affiliation":["Department of Applied Geophysics, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, UMR 7619, Sisyphe, CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Camerlynck"},{"name":"Pierre Mechler","affiliation":["Department of Applied Geophysics, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, UMR 7619, Sisyphe, CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Mechler"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7770940","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"GPR data simulations require above all an efficient forward modeling algorithm.

Causes for the differences are discussed. We show how the crest develops on average days in October and November and discuss the nature of seasonal variations. The fully developed anomaly core is aligned approximately along geomagnetic field lines, resulting in the existence of strong and directional gradients in the anomaly region. As a consequence, the crest latitude and the maximum vertical TEC (VTEC) latitude are noncoincident. The tilt of the anomaly core also causes the slant TEC integrated through the crest to be highly directional. In fact, the use of spherical stratification in predicting slant TEC based on the knowledge of the vertical TEC may give an error as large as 30 to 50% in some directions. Implications for GPS ranging measurements are discussed.","doi":"10.1029/2002RS002657","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770933/07770945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2002RS002657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770933","startPage":"11-1","endPage":"11-12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the equatorial anomaly ionosphere using tomographic images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","displayDocTitle":"A study of the equatorial anomaly ionosphere using tomographic images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of the equatorial anomaly ionosphere using tomographic images","sourcePdf":"rds4856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027546S","chronDate":"Feb.  2003","isNumber":"7770933","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7770945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7770960,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Barthes","affiliation":["Centre d'Etude des Environnements Terrestres et Plan\u00e9taires (CETP), V\u00e9lizy, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Barthes"},{"name":"C\u00e9cile Mallet","affiliation":["Centre d'Etude des Environnements Terrestres et Plan\u00e9taires (CETP), V\u00e9lizy, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9cile","lastName":"Mallet"},{"name":"Peter Gole","affiliation":["Centre d'Etude des Environnements Terrestres et Plan\u00e9taires (CETP), V\u00e9lizy, France"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Gole"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7770960","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7770960","abstract":"The propagation of signals through the atmosphere plays a major role in the quality of communications between ground terminals and satellites. Its characteristics have to be known accurately for appropriate communications equipment to be selected. In the band of frequencies used by operators in the future generation of satellites (beyond 20 GHz), the quality of transmission is especially affected by the attenuation of received signals because of rain, and by other less significant but much more frequent effects due to atmospheric gases, and nonprecipitating water. These phenomena have a direct impact on the availability ratio of a link between a ground terminal and a satellite. Our main goal in this study is to measure the atmospheric attenuation, using dual-frequency ground-based radiometers measuring the sky radiation at different pointing directions, so as to perform a statistical study. A new algorithm, based on a neural approach, is thus developed for estimating atmospheric attenuation, in various meteorological conditions, for several elevation angles and for frequencies between 20 and 50 GHz, from dual-frequency radiometric measurements. A validation of the obtained algorithm is performed on Olympus experimental data for the 20 and 30 GHz channels. At the end of this paper some applications are then presented to underline the usefulness of this new algorithm. The applicability of the algorithm to satellite beacon calibration in Ka or Q band with accuracy of 0.1 dB is shown. Preliminary joint statistics between attenuation at various pointing directions obtained at 40 GHz show what improvement can be expected from satellite diversity in the case of satellite constellations.","doi":"10.1029/2002RS002813","startPage":"3-1","endPage":"3-15","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7770951/07770960.pdf","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2002RS002813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7770951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network model for atmospheric attenuation retrieval between 20 and 50 GHz by means of dual-frequency microwave radiometers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Atmospheric measurements","Atmospheric modeling","Radiometers","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Rain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["atmospheric attenuation","neural networks","propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7770960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2003","displayDocTitle":"Neural network model for atmospheric attenuation retrieval between 20 and 50 GHz by means of dual-frequency microwave radiometers","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network model for atmospheric attenuation retrieval between 20 and 50 GHz by means of dual-frequency microwave radiometers","sourcePdf":"rds4949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028875S","chronDate":"Oct.  2003","isNumber":"7770951","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7770960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771015,"authors":[{"name":"L.

On the other hand, radio seeing also shows up on filled-aperture telescopes as an anomalous refraction, i.e., an apparent displacement of a radio source from its true position. The magnitude of this effect, as a fraction of the beam width, is bigger on larger telescopes, and thus its impact on the pointing is likely to become critically important in the next generation of electrically large filled-aperture radio telescopes (D/\u03bb \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\gtrsim$</tex>\n 3 - 5 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n, where D is the diameter).

This formulation of FDTD can be applied to the study of electromagnetic propagation in the plasma of the ionosphere. In the current work, we consider propagation in randomly structured ionization. The results of numerical FDTD computations of HF fields propagated through realizations of ionospheric structure are compared to the predictions of the standard random media propagation theory, which is based on the parabolic wave equation. The motivation for this study is to expose the way in which the approximate theory breaks down when applied outside of its regime of strict applicability. An earlier published analysis by the authors was limited to spatial signal decorrelation as expressed in \u2113\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</inf>\n, the signal correlation length. In the current work, this spatial decorrelation analysis is supplemented with a similar analysis of signal frequency decorrelation (or delay spread) as expressed in f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</inf>\n, the channel bandwidth. We find that the standard propagation theory for the calculation of f\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</inf>\n predicts larger values than those produced in the FDTD computation. This appears to be due to a polarization coupling effect that is ignored in the standard propagation theory. FDTD-computed correlation lengths are found to be in substantial agreement with the propagation theory at higher frequencies. Agreement degrades in a graceful and understandable way at lower frequencies where the limitations of the approximations used in the theory are violated.","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771081/07771089.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"378","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1029/1999RS002416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/1999RS002416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite difference time domain tests of random media propagation theory: 2.

In the present study, the characteristics of ducts occurring over Gadanki were examined statistically using the modified refractivity. Strong diurnal and seasonal variation in the percentage occurrence of the ducts was found with the highest and lowest occurrences during winter and monsoon seasons, respectively. Duct strength is very strong during midnight to the morning hours than in the evening hours particularly during winter. The mean thickness of the duct and the duct strength were found to be the highest and the strongest in postmonsoon and winter seasons, whereas they are the lowest and the weakest in the monsoon season. Elevated ducts were found to be stronger than the surface and the surface-based ducts. The characteristics of ducts during stable and unstable conditions were also investigated, and it was found that the duct altitude is higher during the stable conditions and is higher during premonsoon followed by postmonsoon, winter and minimum in the monsoon. The maximum wavelength being trapped was investigated, and it was found that wave trapping occurs for the radars with frequencies of 60 GHz and above.","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771224/07771228.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1002/rds.20012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rds.20012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous propagation conditions observed over a tropical station using high-resolution GPS radiosonde observations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ducts","Ocean temperature","Refractive index","Monsoons","Earth","Humidity","Surface waves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous propagation conditions observed over a tropical station using high-resolution GPS radiosonde observations","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous propagation conditions observed over a tropical station using high-resolution GPS radiosonde observations","sourcePdf":"rds20012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041602S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"7771224","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7771228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771250,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The new probe is shown to possess approximately 2 to 3 times the bandwidth of traditional coaxial and rectangular/circular waveguide probe systems while maintaining the structural robustness characteristic of rectangular/circular waveguide probe systems. The theoretical development of the probe is presented, namely, by applying Love's equivalence theorem and enforcing the continuity of transverse fields at the dual-ridged waveguide apertures, a system of coupled magnetic field integral equations is derived. The system of coupled magnetic field integral equations is solved using the method of moments to yield theoretical expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients. The complex permittivity and permeability of the unknown material under test are then found by minimizing the root-mean-square difference between the theoretical and measured reflection and transmission coefficients. Experimental results of two magnetic absorbing materials are presented to validate the new probe.

Based on cooperation and the use of variable length spreading codes, the terminals requiring high transmission rate are supported by larger bandwidth and power in order to enhance their quality of service. The proposed resource allocation strategy assigns the terminals with low transmission rate to cooperate with those with high transmission rate by dedicating a part of their bandwidth and power to either relay their data or send a part of it. This will result in a slight limitation on the performance of the cooperating terminals (low rate). Two proposed schemes are presented namely the relaying strategy and re-allocation strategy. These strategies are evaluated against the commonly used rate-matching algorithm which constrains the terminals to fairly share the bandwidth regardless of the transmission rate. The proposed receiver is simple and efficient and the utilized spreading codes provide signal separation and limit multiple access interference MAI. In a CDMA-based framework supporting multirate transmissions, a thorough performance assessment in terms of the error probability and the probability of outage is discussed for the considered strategies under different transmission conditions. The proposed strategies enhance the performance of the high rate user compared to the rate-matching algorithm and slightly hold back the low rate user performance. Moreover, the re-allocation strategy enhances the system capability to support higher transmission rate at no additional cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","volume":"48","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An efficient bandwidth sharing strategy through users' cooperation for multirate networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient bandwidth sharing strategy through users' cooperation for multirate networks","sourcePdf":"rds20071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020595S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"7771254","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7771273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771287,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA."],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Ji Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, USA."],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Rui Qiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, USA."],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Qiang"},{"name":"Atef Elsherbeni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA."],"firstName":"Atef","lastName":"Elsherbeni"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7771287","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Finite difference methods","Periodic structures","Boundary conditions","Slabs","Dielectrics"]}],"abstract":"An efficient finite difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm with a simple periodic boundary condition (PBC) is developed to analyze reflection and transmission properties of general periodic structures with arbitrary incident angles.

The LNA consists of three stages of InP high electron mobility transistors with a gate length of 130 nm. It exhibits about 44 dB gain and less than 2 K average NT in the operational band of 4 GHz to 8 GHz. A detailed uncertainty analysis is outlined to evaluate a variety of error sources in the measurement. The calculated uncertainty shows as low as 0.1 dB on the measured gain of about 44 dB and 0.18 K on the measured NT of 1.65 K, indicating excellent measurement accuracy. A breakdown of the uncertainty components helps identify the major causes of the overall uncertainty and enlightens us about how to further improve accuracy. It is important to know the actual physical temperature of the passive termination that is used as a cryogenic noise source in experiments. Due to its large temperature gradients, the commercial matched load is replaced by a custom-made attenuator that is isothermal and consequently provides reliable NT measurements of the LNA. The precision measurement technique developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology is independent from the manufacturers' characterization method. This study marks the first time that such a low NT from a cryogenic LNA is verified independently with such a low uncertainty.","doi":"10.1002/rds.20039","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771343/07771358.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rds.20039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and uncertainty analysis of a cryogenic low-noise amplifier with noise temperature below 2 K","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and uncertainty analysis of a cryogenic low-noise amplifier with noise temperature below 2 K","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771358/","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and uncertainty analysis of a cryogenic low-noise amplifier with noise temperature below 2 K","sourcePdf":"rds20039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041236S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"7771343","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7771358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7771382,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Since the PEMC boundary condition requires collocation of same components of both electric and magnetic fields at the boundary grids, which is not compatible with the original FDTD algorithm, its implementation in FDTD is challenging and requires modification in the algorithm. To do this task, first, the original FDTD cell is modified by inserting the required field components not present in the original cell. Then, a novel formulation is developed for updating fields' components at the boundary. Modeling of a PEMC planar interface, a corner point, and a wedge point are presented. Finally, numerical examples are presented to show stability, accuracy, and applicability of the proposed approach. Validation is achieved by comparisons with existing analytic methods and/or conventional FDTD for special cases of PEC and PMC boundaries.","doi":"10.1002/rds.20051","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771430/07771438.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rds.20051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of the perfect electromagnetic conducting boundary in the finite difference time domain method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771438/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of the perfect electromagnetic conducting boundary in the finite difference time domain method","volume":"48","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of the perfect electromagnetic conducting boundary in the finite difference time domain method","sourcePdf":"rds20051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034645S","chronDate":"July  2013","isNumber":"7771430","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7771438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771448,"authors":[{"name":"Nikola Mataga","affiliation":["Micro-Link, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Mataga"},{"name":"Radovan Zentner","affiliation":["University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Radovan","lastName":"Zentner"},{"name":"Ana Katalini\u0107 Mucalo","affiliation":["Croatian Post and Electronic Communications Agency, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ana Katalini\u0107","lastName":"Mucalo"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7771448","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Ray-tracing data are usually given as angles of arrival and departure, transmitter and receiver coordinates, ray length and delay, received power level, and polarity. Usually, these values are given in raw data with some resolution that covers the area of interest where the simulation is performed. There are two main drawbacks of such approach: first, a huge amount of storage capacity is typically needed and second, although the area of interest is covered by a certain resolution, it is nearly impossible to interpolate between sample points and new time, and memory consuming simulations are necessary in order to increase the resolution of the simulations. This paper addresses the two mentioned drawbacks of ray tracing, suggesting a procedure based on the concept of ray entities both to enable continuous interpolation of ray-tracing data and reduce the memory needed for storing data. Ray entity is a set of rays that all undergo the same series of propagation phenomena (direct ray, diffraction, reflection, or scattering) on the same objects (building walls or edges). The method is given and illustrated for reflection and diffraction phenomena, and diffuse scattering was not included, but discussion is easily extended to this propagation type as well. The paper gives detailed statistics of entities' length and rays' count per simulated receiver point in few illustrative examples and provides an insight on how to interpolate angles of arrival and departure, ray length, and received power level in order to provide a continuous description of the radio environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771441/07771448.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"230","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1002/2013RS005313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2013RS005313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray entity based postprocessing of ray-tracing data for continuous modeling of radio channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diffraction","Receivers","Interpolation","Ray tracing","Buildings","Antenna measurements","Geophysical measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Ray entity based postprocessing of ray-tracing data for continuous modeling of radio channel","volume":"49","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray entity based postprocessing of ray-tracing data for continuous modeling of radio channel","sourcePdf":"rds20108.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099377S","chronDate":"March  2014","isNumber":"7771441","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7771448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771471,"authors":[{"name":"Andria Bilich","firstName":"Andria","lastName":"Bilich"},{"name":"Kristine M.

This model assumes that rays do not change in the vicinity of the arrays. It uses spherical propagation and image theory to construct the MIMO channel for any array configuration. The main novelty of this model is that it takes into account multiple reflections, diffraction, variations in the reflection coefficient for single-bounce rays, and variations in the diffraction coefficient. Reflection is shown to be sensitive for hard polarization at the Brewster angle, though these rays have very low energy. Diffraction must be considered at the shadow boundaries of the diffraction wedge and assuming a constant diffraction coefficient, leads to inaccurate results at these regions. It is shown that in outdoor environments and for long distances, this model and the planar wave model provide similar results. However, at short distances, the parametric spherical wave model yields more accurate MIMO channels. Finally, the model is compared to some measurements in an outdoor environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"April 2007","volume":"42","issue":"02","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parametric spherical wave multiple-input and multiple-output model for ray-based simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric spherical wave multiple-input and multiple-output model for ray-based simulations","sourcePdf":"rds5238.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020741S","chronDate":"April  2007","isNumber":"7771472","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7771474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771491,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Several techniques are described in the literature for emitter localization based on Doppler frequency shifts. These techniques can be used efficiently for emitter localization by using narrowband signals. Although these methods are simple and efficient, the application to the radar systems for target localization is very limited. In this paper, a new low-complexity target localization method, Target Localization via Doppler Frequencies (TLDF), for Doppler-only Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) radar with widely separated stations is described. By using widely separated MIMO radars with unmodulated continuous wave signals, the received frequencies and the Doppler shifts can be estimated efficiently. The position and the velocity of the target can be found from these estimated frequencies by a search in the position space. As the Doppler frequency is estimated efficiently, not only the target velocity but also the direction of the target is estimated accurately with the TLDF method. The Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRB) are calculated for the target velocity and the target position estimations in two-dimensional space. In simulations, the proposed method is compared with the iso-Doppler curves-based traditional method and with the CRB for different geometries. The performance of the proposed method is not affected from the target amplitude fluctuations because of its frequency-based nature. Finally, the comparison between the frequency-only MIMO radar and the pulsed monostatic radar is investigated, and the simplicity and the efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1002/2013RS005245","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771501/07771508.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2013RS005245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-based target localization methods for widely separated MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771508/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-based target localization methods for widely separated MIMO radar","volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-based target localization methods for widely separated MIMO radar","sourcePdf":"rds20091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02132S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"7771501","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7771508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771556,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Al\u00f9","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Al\u00f9"},{"name":"Nader Engheta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Engheta"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7771556","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasmons","Metamaterials","Optical waveguides","Geometry","Permittivity","Dispersion","Resonant frequency"]}],"abstract":"We describe our recent results on some of the anomalous propagation properties of subdiffractive guided modes along plasmonic or metamaterial cylindrical waveguides with core-shell structures, with particular attention to the design of optical subwavelength nanodevices.

Forward and backward modes may be envisioned in this latter regime, traveling with subdiffraction cross section along the cylindrical interface between plasmonic and nonplasmonic materials. In general, two oppositely oriented power flows arise in the positive and negative permittivity regions, consistent with our previous results in the planar geometry.

These fluctuation patterns have probably not been noted in the past because of the low sampling frequencies and coarse quantization of power measurements in most GPS receivers. We demonstrate that the source of these fluctuations is usually not edge-type diffraction from steep ionospheric gradients, as is often hypothesized for quasiperiodic scintillation, despite some features consistent with ionospheric generation. Instead, in most cases these spectrogram patterns derive from intersatellite signal interference between pairs of coarse/acquisition (C/A) codes broadcast on L1. As evidence of this mechanism, we show that most spectrogram features appear on pairs of satellite tracking channels and that the patterns can be reproduced using a multisatellite GPS simulator. We also model the spectrogram patterns, both with regard to the basic GPS C/A code correlation process and the differential Doppler shift conditions that cause the fluctuations. In this latter respect, the GPS quasiperiodic scintillation observations bear resemblance to a mechanism discussed by L. A. Hajkowicz for traditional satellite beacons. Despite the complex nature of the intersatellite interference phenomenon, we can model when the spectrogram patterns are expected to appear.

This is done by statistically estimating the duct strength (range- and height-dependent atmospheric index of refraction) from the sea surface reflected radar clutter. These environmental statistics can then be used to predict the radar performance. In previous work, genetic algorithms (GA) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers were used to calculate the atmospheric refractivity from returned radar clutter. Although GA is fast and estimates the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution well, it poorly calculates the multidimensional integrals required to obtain the means, variances, and underlying posterior probability distribution functions of the estimated parameters. More accurate distributions and integral calculations can be obtained using MCMC samplers, such as the Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling (GS) algorithms. Their drawback is that they require a large number of samples relative to the global optimization techniques such as GA and become impractical with an increasing number of unknowns. A hybrid GA-MCMC method based on the nearest neighborhood algorithm is implemented in this paper. It is an improved GA method which improves integral calculation accuracy through hybridization with a MCMC sampler. Since the number of forward models is determined by GA, it requires fewer forward model samples than a MCMC, enabling inversion of atmospheric models with a larger number of unknowns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"03","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical maritime radar duct estimation using hybrid genetic algorithm\u2013Markov chain Monte Carlo method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical maritime radar duct estimation using hybrid genetic algorithm\u2013Markov chain Monte Carlo method","sourcePdf":"rds5400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0298S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"7771563","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"15","articleId":"7771583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771584,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr Erg\u00fcl","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey."],"firstName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Erg\u00fcl"},{"name":"Levent G\u00fcrel","affiliation":["Computational Electromagnetics Research Center, Bilkent University, Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey."],"firstName":"Levent","lastName":"G\u00fcrel"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7771584","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771584","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Mathematical model","Genetic algorithms","MLFMA","Directive antennas","Optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1029/2006RS003567","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771563/07771584.pdf","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2006RS003567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and synthesis of circular-sectoral arrays of log-periodic antennas using multilevel fast multipole algorithm and genetic algorithms","abstract":"Circular-sectoral arrays of log-periodic (LP) antennas are presented for frequency-independent operation and beam-steering capability.

Such techniques are guided however by the appropriate clairvoyant detector structures and hence it is proper to start by studying these detectors. As part of this review, the paper offers new ways of looking at this problem that suggest new research topics.

First, medical applications of radars are described, and some emerging research fields are highlighted. Then, medical radars are analyzed in terms of block diagrams and behavioral equations and some implementations are shown as examples. A section is dedicated to the radiating structures used in these radars. Finally, human safety and environmental impact issues are addressed. The most investigated medical applications of radars are breast tumor diagnostics and remote monitoring of cardiorespiratory activity. New fields of interest are physiological liquid detection, and the monitoring of artery walls and vocal cord movements. Among the various topologies, continuous wave (CW) radars have been proven to yield the highest range resolution that is limited only by the system noise while the resolution of ultra wideband (UWB) and frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars is also related to the used frequency bandwidth. Concerning the maximum range, UWB radars have the best performance due to their ability to operate in the presence of environmental clutter. As for the radiating structures, planar antennas are preferred for diagnostic applications, due to their small dimensions and good matching when placed in contact with the human body. Radar systems for remote monitoring, instead, are designed by using high gain antennas and taking into account the complex radar cross section (RCS) of the body.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/62/7771659/07771668.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2016.140167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2016.140167","startPage":"64","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of radar systems for medical applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771668/","displayDocTitle":"A survey of radar systems for medical applications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7771668/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"16521085","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","publicationDate":"November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of radar systems for medical applications","sourcePdf":"64-81_aesm-31-11s-64.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166926S","chronDate":"November  2016","xplore-pub-id":"62","isNumber":"7771659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7771659","articleId":"7771668","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7771669,"authors":[{"name":"Giancarmine Fasano","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Giancarmine","lastName":"Fasano","id":"37295288700"},{"name":"Domenico Accado","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Accado","id":"37086062317"},{"name":"Antonio Moccia","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Moccia","id":"37268763800"},{"name":"David Moroney","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Aviation System Development, The MITRE Corporation, McLean, VA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Moroney","id":"37086060025"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"7771669","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2871},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771669","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Tutorials","Air traffic control","Collision avoidance","Sensors","Military aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","autonomous aerial vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aircraft systems","sense and avoid","UAS","SAA architectures","civil aviation authorities","CAAs"]}],"abstract":"Sense and avoid (SAA) represents one of the main roadblocks to the integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operations by aviation authorities around the world.

The replacement of large power plants by growing numbers of distributed energy resources (DERs) increases the dependency of the power system on small scale, distributed production. Many of these DERs can be accessed and controlled remotely, posing a cybersecurity risk. This paper investigates an intrusion detection system which evaluates the DER operation in order to discover unauthorized control actions. The proposed anomaly detection method is based on an ensemble of non-linear artificial neural network DER models which detect and evaluate anomalies in DER operation. The proposed method is validated against measurement data which yields a precision of 0.947 and an accuracy of 0.976. This improves the precision and accuracy of a classic model-based anomaly detection by 75.7% and 9.2%, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble regression model-based anomaly detection for cyber-physical intrusion detection in smart grids","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference (EPEC)","doi":"10.1109/EPEC.2016.7771704","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference (EPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7754714/7771673/07771704.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEC.2016.7771704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble regression model-based anomaly detection for cyber-physical intrusion detection in smart grids","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7771704/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522332","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble regression model-based anomaly detection for cyber-physical intrusion detection in smart grids","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p252kosek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071028S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7754714","isNumber":"7771673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7754714","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7771673","articleId":"7771704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771715,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Ghanbari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Ghanbari","id":"37086208050"},{"name":"Witold Kinsner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Witold","lastName":"Kinsner","id":"37273230700"},{"name":"Ken Ferens","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Ferens","id":"37327269800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1920-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7771715","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Power demand","Fractals","Artificial neural networks","Feature extraction","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","neural nets","power consumption","power engineering computing","power system security","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","smart grid","wavelet transform","variance fractal dimension","artificial neural network","anomalous power consumption patterns attacks","discrete wavelet transform","ANN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["The Daubechies wavelet transform","variance fractal dimension","anomalous power consumption attack","smart grid","computer network security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771715","abstract":"This paper presents a method for detecting anomalous power consumption patterns attacks, using a discrete wavelet transform, as well as the variance fractal dimension (VFD) and an artificial neural network (ANN) for a smart grid.

Previous work in this area has provided information regarding the design and application of harmonic filters as well as discussion of the different filter topologies that are typically employed. However, there is a lack of information in the area of optimal filter sizing and topology selection when the power system is networked. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to optimally solve the filter sizing and topology selection problem using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed approach is based on the minimization of a multi-objective optimization function while considering the effects of existing shunt capacitor banks and network topology changes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown via a numerical example.

In order to improve its radio frequency stealth ability, a novel coordination method of opportunistic array radars in the network for target tracking in clutter is presented. First, the database of radar cross section for targets is built, then the signal-to-noise ratio for netted radars is computed according to the radar cross section and range of target. Then the joint probabilistic data association algorithm of tracking is improved with consideration of emitted power of the opportunistic array radar, which has a main impact on detection probability for tracking in clutter. Finally, with the help of grey relational grade and covariance control, the opportunistic array radar with the minimum radiated power will be selected for better radio frequency stealth performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only has excellent tracking accuracy in clutter but also saves much more radiated power comparing with other methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2015RS005728","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771805/07771811.pdf","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1196","doi":"10.1002/2015RS005728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal coordination method of opportunistic array radars for multi-target-tracking-based radio frequency stealth in clutter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal coordination method of opportunistic array radars for multi-target-tracking-based radio frequency stealth in clutter","volume":"50","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal coordination method of opportunistic array radars for multi-target-tracking-based radio frequency stealth in clutter","sourcePdf":"rds20313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036846S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","isNumber":"7771805","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"11","articleId":"7771811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771821,"authors":[{"name":"Annarita Di Lallo","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Annarita","lastName":"Di Lallo","id":"37547175900"},{"name":"Alfonso Farina","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Farina","id":"37085471777"},{"name":"Riccardo Fulcoli","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Fulcoli","id":"37088725577"},{"name":"Sandro Immediata","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Sandro","lastName":"Immediata","id":"37272962600"},{"name":"Matteo Sedehi","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Sedehi","id":"37088742163"},{"name":"Enrico Tilli","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Tilli","id":"37088739518"},{"name":"Luca Timmoneri","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Timmoneri","id":"37274491500"},{"name":"Annarita Di Lallo","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Annarita","lastName":"Di Lallo","id":"37088741781"},{"name":"Alfonso Farina","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Farina","id":"37274494900"},{"name":"Riccardo Fulcoli","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Fulcoli","id":"37300759700"},{"name":"Sandro Immediata","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Sandro","lastName":"Immediata","id":"37088729665"},{"name":"Matteo Sedehi","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Sedehi","id":"37295667800"},{"name":"Enrico Tilli","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Tilli","id":"37660509100"},{"name":"Luca Timmoneri","affiliation":["Leonardo, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Timmoneri","id":"37085830948"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"7771821","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Passive radar","Surveillance","Frequency modulation","Three-dimensional displays","Radar tracking","Digital  video broadcasting","Electromagnetics","Green products"]}],"abstract":"The name comes from an Ancient Greek wind instrument because AULOS is a passive radar family system developed by SELEX Sistemi Integrati (now Finmeccanica) that exploits electromagnetic energy already present in the environment such as FM frequency radio and DVB-T (digital video broadcast - terrestrial) emissions, and is completely environmentally friendly.

In this paper, aspects of compressed sensing (CS) are introduced to coherent radar imaging. We propose a single CS-based formalism that enables the full three-dimensional (3-D) \u2014 range, Doppler frequency, and horizontal spatial (represented by the direction cosines) domain \u2014 imaging. This new method can not only reduce the system costs and decrease the needed number of baselines by enabling spatial sparse sampling but also achieve high resolution in the range, Doppler frequency, and horizontal space dimensions. Using an assumption of point targets, a 3-D radar signal model for imaging has been derived. By comparing numerical simulations with the fast Fourier transform and maximum entropy methods at different signal-to-noise ratios, we demonstrate that the CS method can provide better performance in resolution and detectability given comparatively few available measurements relative to the number required by Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion. These techniques are being applied to radar meteor observations.","doi":"10.1002/2015RS005688","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771826/07771828.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2015RS005688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent radar imaging based on compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771828/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent radar imaging based on compressed sensing","volume":"50","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent radar imaging based on compressed sensing","sourcePdf":"rds20307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057046S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","isNumber":"7771826","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7771828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771852,"authors":[{"name":"Franco Fuschini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering \u201cG.

It is probably the best model to assist in the design and planning of future short-range, millimeter-wave wireless systems, where the more limited propagation environment with respect to UHF frequencies allows to overcome traditional high-CPU time limitations while the higher operating frequency makes ray-optics approximations less drastic and allows to achieve an unprecedented level of accuracy. An overview of ray tracing propagation modeling is given in this paper, with a special attention to future prospects and applications.

Radio systems, where rain attenuation causes outages, may take advantage of this effect to increase the radio link or satellite link availability using diversity techniques. In the Oslo region with Norwegian Meteorological Institute located at Blindern, there are 24 tipping bucket rain gauges within 50 km radius of the institute where each station has 5 years or more of simultaneous data periods with the station at the institute. The simultaneous data have been used to calculate spatial rain rate correlation and derive a prediction method based on separation distance and orientation with respect to dominating weather direction. Part of joint rain rate distribution was fitted to lognormal to find the measured correlation coefficients. In addition, an analysis of independent radiosonde data suggests that prevailing wind at 700 hPa or 850 hPa altitude (approximately 3000 m or 1500 m above sea level), conditioned thunderstorm index in the range of 15 to 20, may be used to identify the actual rainfall movement or dominant weather direction.

The channel impulse response and its Fourier transform, the channel transfer function, are described in detail, and their common statistical characterizations are also reviewed. The most common models for the V2V channel-the tapped delay line and geometry-based stochastic channel models-are covered in some detail. We highlight key differences between the V2V channel and the well-known cellular radio channel. These differences are the more rapid time variation and the higher probability of obstruction of the direct line of sight component; modeling of these effects has required some novel approaches. The V2V channel's nonstationary statistical behavior is addressed, as is the use of multiple-antenna systems.

When the antenna array receives multipath reflections which are coherent with the far-field line-of-sight signal, estimating the far- and near-field components becomes an important problem. In this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the far-field source and to localize its near-field multipaths. Far-field source DOA is estimated using calibration of the antenna array. A near-to-far transformation is proposed for the estimation of the near-field source DOA angles. In order to estimate the near-field range parameters, a compressive sensing approach is presented where a dictionary with near-field sources with different ranges is employed. As a result, the proposed method estimates the far-field and near-field source DOAs as well as the range and the signal amplitudes of the near-field sources. This method is evaluated using close-to-real world data generated by a numerical electromagnetic tool, where the array and transmitter are placed in an irregular terrain and array data are generated using full 3-D propagation model. It is shown that unknown source parameters can be estimated effectively showing the potential of the proposed approach in applications involving high-frequency direction finding and indoor localization.","doi":"10.1002/2014RS005474","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771926/07771932.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2014RS005474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Far-field DOA estimation and near-field localization for multipath signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Far-field DOA estimation and near-field localization for multipath signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771932/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-field DOA estimation and near-field localization for multipath signals","sourcePdf":"rds20165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028368S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","isNumber":"7771926","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7771932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7771943,"authors":[{"name":"Salma Bourbia","affiliation":["Cite Technologique des Communications, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Salma","lastName":"Bourbia"},{"name":"Daniel Le Guennec","affiliation":["IETR/SUPELEC, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Daniel Le","lastName":"Guennec"},{"name":"Khaled Grati","affiliation":["Cite Technologique des Communications, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Grati"},{"name":"Adel Ghazel","affiliation":["Cite Technologique des Communications, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Ghazel"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7771943","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7771943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Equalizers","Signal to noise ratio","Decision making","Computational complexity","Measurement","Bit error rate"]}],"doi":"10.1002/2013RS005309","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771938/07771943.pdf","startPage":"861","endPage":"889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2013RS005309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-making scenarios for reducing the computational complexity in a green cognitive radio receiver","abstract":"The idea that we highlight in this paper is how to reduce the computational complexity by limiting the processing in the receiver chain. For this we seek for limiting the use of the beamforming process and the equalization process according to the conditions. Indeed, with the cognitive features the receiver observes its environment and decides to either keep or turn off these processes without degrading its performances. The decision method that we developed is based on the statistical modeling of the radio environment, and the purpose of this approach is to minimize the percentage of bad decisions by considering the errors of observation. Furthermore, we first address the two decision scenarios separately and we seek to prove that the decisions to turn off the equalizer and the beamforming, when they are not necessary, lead to reduce the computational complexity of the receiver. Then we focus on the behavior of the receiver facing both decision scenarios. Thus, we formulate the decision problem in two different ways: in the first case we consider that the receiver performs joint decisions about the two operations of beamforming and equalization, in the second case we suppose that it handles the two decision scenarios sequentially. We compare then the performance of the receiver in the two cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2014","volume":"49","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decision-making scenarios for reducing the computational complexity in a green cognitive radio receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-making scenarios for reducing the computational complexity in a green cognitive radio receiver","sourcePdf":"rds20175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036854S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","isNumber":"7771938","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7771943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771946,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To investigate these phenomena, one of the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC RO receivers was set to track RO signals deep below the limb, down to a height of straight line \u2212350 km on 5\u20136 October 2010. Analysis of the spectrograms revealed the existence of two types of signals below \u2212200 km, RO signals induced by tropospheric propagation and interfering signals not transmitted by the occulted GPS. The RO signals induced by tropospheric propagation arrive from impact heights corresponding to inversion layers. Wave optics modeling of RO signals showed that deep signals exist when the refractivity gradient exceeds critical (super-refraction). The existence of such signals is a diffractional phenomenon, which offers a new quality control parameter to identify occultations that may be affected by super-refraction. This is important for RO data assimilation in weather models in the moist lower troposphere because assimilation of RO data affected by super-refraction is an ill-conditioned problem. Detection of the tropospheric ducts also may be useful for evaluation of radio wave propagation conditions. For infinitely horizontally extended ducts, the deep signals are extended in duration, have amplitudes of about 0.1%, and exist for only elevated ducts. For ducts of limited horizontal extension, the deep signals are shorter in duration, have amplitude of about 1%, and may exist for both elevated and surface ducts. The interfering signals were found in about half of occultations. Based on frequency modeling, in most cases, the interfering signal was identified with non-occulted GPS. The disturbance of retrieved bending angle induced by an interfering signal from a non-occulted GPS in a region of strong defocusing and significant spectral spread of RO signal was modeled and determined to be quite large, up to 10% of bending angle. However, the probability of occurrence of such interference (not estimated), generally, must be low. Removal of the interfering signal by high-pass filtering was tested, but it introduced a disturbance of bending angle of about the same magnitude as the interfering signal itself.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","volume":"49","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Observation, analysis, and modeling of deep radio occultation signals: Effects of tropospheric ducts and interfering signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observation, analysis, and modeling of deep radio occultation signals: Effects of tropospheric ducts and interfering signals","sourcePdf":"rds20179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052793S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","isNumber":"7771938","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7771946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7771976,"authors":[{"name":"Fikadu T.

In this paper, we quantify the excess path loss and small-scale fading at the lower VHF and the 2.4 GHz bands based on short-range measurements in various environments. We consider indoor-to-indoor, outdoor-to-indoor, and non-line-of-sight outdoor measurements and compare the results with measurements at higher frequencies which are used in conventional systems (i.e., 2.4 GHz). Propagation measurements at the lower VHF band are carried out by using an electrically small antenna to assess the possibility of achieving a miniaturized, mobile system for near-ground communication. For each measurement scenario considered, path loss and small-scale fading are characterized after calibrating the differences in the systems used for measurements at different frequencies, including variations in antenna performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7771976/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of lower VHF band for short-range communication and geolocation applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of lower VHF band for short-range communication and geolocation applications","sourcePdf":"rds20240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022452S","chronDate":"May  2015","isNumber":"7771968","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"23","articleId":"7771976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7771995,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph D.

We exploit the symmetry properties of UCA arrays to build two different datasets for elevation and azimuth angles. Linear Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural networks are then sequentially trained on each dataset to separately estimate elevation and azimuth angles.

A matching network optimization is employed to design the module over a range of power levels, air-gap voltages, input and output voltages, and switching frequencies to evaluate impacts on its efficiency, safety, and practical implementation. Results indicate that increasing module power decreases the required matching network inductances, but at the cost of increased fringing fields. Increasing switching frequency, however, decreases both the required inductances and fringing fields. Maximum and minimum limits on module power and switching frequency are determined based on a detailed air-core inductor design procedure. These module-level results are currently informing the design of a kW-level multi-modular capacitive WPT system with a 12-cm air-gap and a target power transfer density of 50 kW/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7772063/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522594","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design tradeoffs in a multi-modular capacitive wireless power transfer system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design tradeoffs in a multi-modular capacitive wireless power transfer system","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"A2LA36036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060881S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761913","isNumber":"7772054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761913","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7772054","articleId":"7772063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7772068,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085783824"},{"name":"Farshid Tamjid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Farshid","lastName":"Tamjid","id":"37085993063"},{"name":"Chongwen Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Chongwen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38667912800"},{"name":"Daniel Costinett","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Costinett","id":"37595742000"},{"name":"Aly Fath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA"],"firstName":"Aly","lastName":"Fath","id":"37087074478"},{"name":"Songnan Yang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Songnan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086000979"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3414-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3413-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3415-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7772068","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":823},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772068","abstract":"A two-stage power conversion architecture for the transmitter in wireless power transfer applications is introduced.

This paper proposes a new resource allocation strategy in cooperative multi-relay cognitive radio networks, in which multi second users can work as the relays of primary users to accelerate the data transmission when the channel between primary transmitter and primary receiver is weak. In the strategy, the data transmission slot is divided into two sub-slots. In the first slot, the primary user chooses suitable second users and sub-channels to relay primary user's data; and then, the second users who have been chosen as the relays select the remaining idle sub-channels to transmit their own data. In the second slot, the second users who work as the relays forward primary user's data by decode-and-forward (DF) protocol; meanwhile, second users select the remaining idle sub-channels to transmit their own data. Simulation results show that the resource allocation strategy proposed improve the throughput of the cognitive radio network obviously compared with the single relay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772099","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7754733/7772099/07772112.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A resource allocation strategy for cooperative multi-relay cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7772112/","displayDocTitle":"A resource allocation strategy for cooperative multi-relay cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522467","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A resource allocation strategy for cooperative multi-relay cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"AResourceAllocationGuo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068007S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7754733","isNumber":"7772099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7754733","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7772099","articleId":"7772112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7772119,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Rezac","affiliation":["CESNET z.s.p.o., Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Rezac","id":"38467705900"},{"name":"Jan Rozhon","affiliation":["CESNET z.s.p.o., Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Rozhon","id":"37591218900"},{"name":"Jakub Safarik","affiliation":["CESNET z.s.p.o., Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Safarik","id":"38467870000"},{"name":"Miroslav Voznak","affiliation":["CESNET z.s.p.o., Prague 6, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Voznak","id":"37591219900"},{"name":"Zuzana Bajakova","affiliation":["Dept. of Telecommunications, VSB Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zuzana","lastName":"Bajakova","id":"37086186106"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2578-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"7772119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Servers","Neurons","Neural networks","IP networks","Security","Telephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet telephony","neural nets","pattern classification","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP telephony security","automatic neural network classifier","IP telephony infrastructures","systematic monitoring","security threats","analytical optimization","topology monitoring","distributed honeypot network","autonomous probes","frequent attacks detection","IP telephony network elements"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772119","abstract":"The complexity and robustness of the currently used IP telephony infrastructures requires systematic monitoring of the network against security threats, where captured incidents are often used as a source of information for further research and analytical optimization of the monitored topologies.

To capture individual incidents a distributed honeypot network with the autonomous probes has been developed too and the interconnection of the proposed mechanisms leads into a comprehensive system of frequent attacks detection. These security threats are currently used by attackers to penetrate an IP telephony network elements, and their effective detection can reduce a growing number of abused users.

They effectively enhance the system capacity and reduce the co-channel interference. Smart antenna is an array antenna that uses adaptive beamforming algorithms to steer the main beam toward the desired signal direction and reject the interfering signals of the same frequency from other directions without moving the antenna. This is achieved by continuously updating the weights of each radiating element (antenna). An algorithm with low complexity, low computation costs, high speed convergence rates and better performance is usually preferred. This paper introduces a new performance investigation and comparison between five different beamforming algorithms: Least Mean Square (LMS), Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS), Sample Matrix Inversion (SMI), Recursive Least Square (RLS) and Hybrid Least Mean Square / Sample Matrix Inversion (LMS/SMI). In this investigation, the number of array elements and the displacement among them are changed in each algorithm. Simulation experiments are carried out, and the results are compared to verify the effectiveness of this investigation. The performance of each algorithm is optimized and demonstrated using MATLAB software package.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772099","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7754733/7772099/07772134.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Different adaptive beamforming algorithms for performance investigation of smart antenna system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7772134/","displayDocTitle":"Different adaptive beamforming algorithms for performance investigation of smart antenna system","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522512","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Different adaptive beamforming algorithms for performance investigation of smart antenna system","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"DifferentAdaptiveBeamformingKhalaf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061829S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7754733","isNumber":"7772099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7754733","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7772099","articleId":"7772134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7772147,"authors":[{"name":"Yunsung Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Korea"],"firstName":"Yunsung","lastName":"Choi","id":"37066439400"},{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279318900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2578-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"7772147","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Stability analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Power control","Numerical stability","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-layer requirement","channel knowledge","secondary power allocation strategies","network layer stability","power control","physical-layer tool","network-layer goal","primary user","primary communication","secondary transmitters","cognitive radio systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR) systems","stable throughput","power allocation","interweave CR","underlay CR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772147","doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772147","publicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","abstract":"In cognitive radio (CR) systems, secondary transmitters (STs) should have etiquette that its transmission is not harmful to primary communication.

The proposed channel estimator is performed in two stages. The pre-FFT stage employs the Least Square (LS) estimation and smoothing technique to estimate the Channel Frequency Response (CFR). The post-FFT stage employs this CFR estimate to extract the UW influence and then refines the CFR estimate using a decision feedback technique. Via simulation results, we show that the proposed estimator provides higher performance gain over the conventional LS channel estimator and performs closely to the Linear Minimum Mean-Squared Error (LMMSE) one. Additionally, the computational complexity of our proposal is comparable with the LS approach and significantly lower than that of LMMSE one.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th International

edge-growth (PEG) algorithm in order to control the girth of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code Tanner graphs constructed. Using the modified algorithm, the edge densities in short irregular rate-% LDPC code graphs can be increased without increasing the correlation between edges in graphs by creating cycles of undesired length. Density evolution (DE) optimized symbol node degree distributions used for constructing short-to-medium length codes were further optimized (slightly altered) while maintaining the maximum edge correlation (minimum local girths) that exists in graphs constructed using the unaltered DE optimized distributions. As a result of improved degree sequences (and graph densities) which were derived, short-to-medium length LDPC codes with lower error floors than published for LDPC codes of identical length and rate were found. These slightly denser codes have lower error floor than codes constructed using DE optimized degree distributions in PEG algorithms modified for improved approximate cycle extrinsic message degrees (ACE). Simulation results show that, at a code length of 512, efficient irregular rate-% PEG codes have significantly lower error floors than a rate-% IEEE 802.16e (WiMAX) LDPC code of length 576.","doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772157","publicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7754733/7772099/07772157.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lowering the error floor of short-to-medium length LDPC codes using optimal low-correlated-edge density (OED) PEG Tanner graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Lowering the error floor of short-to-medium length LDPC codes using optimal low-correlated-edge density (OED) PEG Tanner graphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772157/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16522453","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7772157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowering the error floor of short-to-medium length LDPC codes using optimal low-correlated-edge density (OED) PEG Tanner graphs","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"LoweringtheErrorAbduAguye.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052671S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7754733","isNumber":"7772099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7754733","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7772099","articleId":"7772157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7772162,"authors":[{"name":"Niloofar Mehrnia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Istanbul Sehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Niloofar","lastName":"Mehrnia","id":"37086027802"},{"name":"Mehmet Kemal Ozdemir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Istanbul Sehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet Kemal","lastName":"Ozdemir","id":"38253337600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2578-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"7772162","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":724},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea surface","Mathematical model","Ducts","Receivers","Delays","Propagation losses","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine communication","radiowaves","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel maritime channel models","millimeter radiowaves","millimeter wave propagation simulations","sea LoS ship","ship communication channels","channel parameters","oxygen attenuation","propagation loss model","sea surface propagation","free space path loss model","maritime channels","exponential function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maritime channel modeling","ray tracing","wireless path loss","millimeter radiowaves"]}],"abstract":"This work presents and analyzes the results of millimeter-wave propagation simulations performed for over the sea LoS ship to ship communication channels. We present a channel characterization study where channel parameters such as path loss, received power, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile are obtained by using a ray tracing approach. 5G candidate frequencies, 35 GHz and 94 GHz were chosen as the primary bands of interest since these two bands have minimum water and oxygen attenuation, thereby promising better performance among the other frequency bands. Our results indicate that 2-ray analytical propagation loss model should only be used for short ranges over the sea surface propagation at typical frequencies considered by 5G. However, free space path loss model cannot predict the behavior of channel over the sea surface in high frequencies even for short ranges. Therefore, in this study a new model that is the modified version of 2-ray path loss model is proposed, in which a coefficient in the power of exponential function is introduced to better predict the behavior of maritime channels of 5G. It is shown that the proposed model can predict the path loss of maritime channel better than the existing models.","doi":"10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772162","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7754733/7772099/07772162.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772162","publicationTitle":"2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772162/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7772162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522465","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"NovelMaritimeChannelMehrnia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049642S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7754733","isNumber":"7772099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7754733","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7772099","articleId":"7772162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split, FESB","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7772163,"authors":[{"name":"Adriana Lipovac","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Dubrovnik, Dubrovnik, Croatia"],"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Lipovac","id":"37075701800"},{"name":"Borivoj Modlic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Borivoj","lastName":"Modlic","id":"37283722200"},{"name":"Mislav Grgic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Mislav","lastName":"Grgic","id":"37269516400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2578-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1847-358X"}],"articleNumber":"7772163","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Floors","Phase modulation","Digital communication","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","error statistics","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual BER","end-to-end digital radio transmission performance","error-generating analog impairments","modulation inaccuracy","power amplifier compression","carrier recovery phase error","I-Q cross-talk","VSA tools","constellation analysis","EVM analysis","nonlinear constituents","nonadditive constituents","equivalent AWGN source","LTE lab","OFDM error floor based estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER","OFDM","LTE","time-dispersive channel"]}],"abstract":"The residual BER - error floor, though useful and widely used metrics for the end-to-end digital radio transmission performance, provides no insight into the error-generating analog impairments (e.g. modulation inaccuracy, power amplifier compression, carrier recovery phase error, or I-Q cross-talk), which, however, are easy to identify by VSA tools such as constellation analysis. As the EVM analysis has become very popular figure of merit in this regard, in this paper, after reviewing crucial advantages of EVM analysis with respect to what we get from BER, we consider estimating EVM from the residual BER assuming that the latter's generally non-linear and non-additive \u201cconstituents\u201d are substituted by the equivalent AWGN source producing the same BER (and EVM) degradation.

Thus, a pioneer effort identifying and quantifying the white space in the UHF and VHF band in Morocco is presented in this paper. The findings reveal a significant amount of vacant yet licensed spectrum. A detailed analysis of the occupancy temporal variation is provided through different metrics. The outcome of the measurement campaign confirms the feasibility of a dynamic spectrum access policy and suggest the need to more spectral investigations in other scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772293/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16522223","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7772293/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A quantitative investigation of spectrum utilization in UHF and VHF bands in Morocco: The road to cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantitative investigation of spectrum utilization in UHF and VHF bands in Morocco: The road to cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Mohammedia, Morocco","sourcePdf":"2016334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079595S","chronDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7753194","isNumber":"7772051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7753194","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7772051","articleId":"7772293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7772297,"authors":[{"name":"Khaoula Hassoune","affiliation":["ENSEM, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Khaoula","lastName":"Hassoune","id":"37086088138"},{"name":"Wafaa Dachry","affiliation":["ENSEM, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Wafaa","lastName":"Dachry","id":"38547408600"},{"name":"Fouad Moutaouakkil","affiliation":["ENSEM, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Fouad","lastName":"Moutaouakkil","id":"37598805900"},{"name":"Hicham Medromi","affiliation":["ENSEM, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hicham","lastName":"Medromi","id":"37297487600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5782-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2536"}],"articleNumber":"7772297","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent sensors","Automobiles","Monitoring","Magnetic sensors","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent transportation systems","road pricing (tolls)","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart parking systems","road traffic congestion","parking availability monitoring","parking reservation","parking dynamic pricing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart parking Systems","sensors","Smart parking Technologies","Smart parking services","Internet of things (IOT)","Multi-agent systems","Expert systems"]}],"abstract":"Not finding a parking space for you sometimes is indeed a critical issue. The number of vehicles is also increasing daily adding to the parking vows at public places. Cities noticed that their drivers had real problems to find a parking space easily especially during peak hours, the difficulty roots from not knowing where the parking spaces are available at the given time. Even if this is known, many vehicles may pursue a small number of parking spaces which in turn leads to traffic congestion. The traffic on roads and parking space has been an area of concern in majority of cities. So, parking monitoring is an important solution. To avoid these problems, recently many new technologies have been developed that help in solving the parking problems to a great extent. Firstly, this paper gives an overview about the concept of smart parking system, their categories and different functionalities. Then we present the latest developments in parking infrastructures. We describe the technologies around parking availability monitoring, parking reservation and dynamic pricing and see how they are utilized in different settings. In addition, a theoretical comparison is presented to show advantages and drawbacks of each different smart parking system to discuss results and open directions for future research.","doi":"10.1109/SITA.2016.7772297","publicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems: Theories and Applications (SITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems: Theories and Applications (SITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7753194/7772051/07772297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITA.2016.7772297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772051","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart parking systems: A survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart parking systems: A survey","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772297/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522184","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7772297/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart parking systems: A survey","confLoc":"Mohammedia, Morocco","sourcePdf":"2016414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052552S","chronDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7753194","isNumber":"7772051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7753194","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7772051","articleId":"7772297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7772304,"authors":[{"name":"Abderrahim El Mhouti","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abderrahim El","lastName":"Mhouti","id":"37086034158"},{"name":"Azeddine Nasseh","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Azeddine","lastName":"Nasseh","id":"37086030545"},{"name":"Mohamed Erradi","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Erradi","id":"37391326300"},{"name":"Jose Marfa Vasqu\u00e8z","affiliation":["Huelva University, Huelva, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Marfa","lastName":"Vasqu\u00e8z","id":"37086033934"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5781-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5782-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2536"}],"articleNumber":"7772304","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Cloud computing","Electronic learning","Collaborative work","Computational modeling","Productivity","Knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","courseware","learning management systems","multi-agent systems","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multiagent system","MAS","collaborative e-learning platform","learning management system","LMS","resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["collaborative e-learning","LMS","multi-agents system","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Today, e-learning featured by collaboration has become more and more important. The most traditional tool of e-learning is the LMS (Learning Management System), which is adopted by many institutions. However, the LMS is not always able to satisfy the needs for interaction and collaboration of actors involved by providing tutors information about the level of collaboration and productivity each student and group. On the other hand, LMS is facing challenges of optimizing large-scale resource management, according to the huge growth of services. The primary aim of this work is to exploit the potential of Multi-Agents Systems (MAS) and cloud computing to improve students collaboration in LMS. Thus, in order to satisfy the needs of interaction and collaboration of students and educators, we propose in this work an interactive and collaborative e-learning platform which combines the advantages of LMS, MAS and cloud computing. The proposed platform is implemented as a cloud-based LMS integrating a MAS permitting to collect, store and manage data and information about students' activities. The platform allows to track the progress of students and their level of collaboration and productivity to provide tutors with information about the realization of students' activities. As a result, tutors exploit these data to promote collaborative learning, avoid the students' isolation and motivate them to use collaborative work tools.","doi":"10.1109/SITA.2016.7772304","publicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems: Theories and Applications (SITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems: Theories and Applications (SITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7753194/7772051/07772304.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SITA.2016.7772304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using cloud computing and a multi-agents system to improve collaborative e-learning in LMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772304/","displayDocTitle":"Using cloud computing and a multi-agents system to improve collaborative e-learning in LMS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522250","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7772304/","conferenceDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using cloud computing and a multi-agents system to improve collaborative e-learning in LMS","confLoc":"Mohammedia, Morocco","sourcePdf":"2016426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075199S","chronDate":"19-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7753194","isNumber":"7772051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7753194","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7772051","articleId":"7772304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7772351,"authors":[{"name":"Donald E.

In cylindrical antenna theory, accurate current and field distributions were found for isolated [King and Wu, 1965] and coupled [King and Sandler, 1964] elements. A fine summary of broadband antennas by Jordan was referenced in recent studies of log-spiral antennas [Dyson, 1965]. New structures included the wire-grid HF Luneburg lens [Sharp, 1965] and double-helix antennas [Ehrenspeck, 1965]. Advances in large quasi-optical antennas included an analysis of focal fields and line source feeds for spherical reflectors [Schell, 1963]; analysis of reflector-subreflector systems such as Cassegrain and Gregorian types [Morgan, 1964]; and a book treating aperture antennas and including many references [Hansen, 1964]. Progress in optical scanning systems included geodesic Luneburg lenses [Rudduck, Ryan, and Walter, 1964], bootlace lenses [Kales and Brown, 1965], and parallel-plate scanners [Rotman and Turner, 1963]. Electronic scanning of phased arrays received major attention. Mutual impedance changes with scan angles were analyzed by the impedance crater concept [Rhodes, 1964]; also techniques for compensating for these changes were developed [Hannan, Lerner, and Knittel, 1965]. Important progress has been made in digital phase shifters. The diode type [White, 1965] has recently been supplemented by latching types employing ferrite cores [Whicker and Jones, 1965]. Adaptive array systems were covered in a special issue [IEEE, 1964]; of particular interest are the Gruenberg paper on retrodirective systems and the Skolnik and King paper on self-steering arrays. The annular slot array has been developed for monopulse [Kelly and Goebels, 1964], Nonuniformly spaced array sidelobes have been bounded by a probabilistic approach [Lo, 1964]. Finally, the important but long unsolved problem of an optimum directivity source with supergain ratio constraint was formally solved [Rhodes, 1963].","doi":"10.1002/rds19661121371","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7772628/07772629.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rds19661121371","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","startPage":"1371","endPage":"1379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"U.S.A. national committee report, fifteenth URSI general assembly, Munich, September 1966: Commission 6, radio waves and transmission of information: Progress in radio waves and transmission of information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7772629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","displayDocTitle":"U.S.A. national committee report, fifteenth URSI general assembly, Munich, September 1966: Commission 6, radio waves and transmission of information: Progress in radio waves and transmission of information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772629/","volume":"1","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"U.S.A. national committee report, fifteenth URSI general assembly, Munich, September 1966: Commission 6, radio waves and transmission of information: Progress in radio waves and transmission of information","sourcePdf":"rds19661121371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020222S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"7772628","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7772629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7772682,"authors":[{"name":"T.

For each polarized wave mode, the medium is effectively isotropic, since the Fourier-transformed wave equation for each principal mode is decoupled and is similar to the one obtained from the usual scalar Helmholtz operator. In application of the theory, consideration is made of the radiation resistance of a linear electric antenna of moderate length oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the static magnetic field. Approximate closed form expressions for the radiation resistance are obtained for the VLF frequency range by using a plasma model appropriate to the magnetosphere. These approximate closed form expressions are compared with the results obtained previously by other workers using a quasi-static approximation, and it is shown that excellent agreement exists between the two methods of analysis. It is concluded that the quasi-static approximation can accurately predict the radiation resistance of a linear antenna in the magnetosphere, given certain moderate restrictions on the antenna length.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7772682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1969","volume":"4","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 1969","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radiation resistance of a short dipole immersed in a cold magnetoionic medium","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation resistance of a short dipole immersed in a cold magnetoionic medium","sourcePdf":"rds22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070986S","chronDate":"Feb.  1969","isNumber":"7772675","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"13","articleId":"7772682","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7772900,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent J.

There has been significant interest in optical frequency standards with a notable development of a methane-stabilized laser by John Hall [Barger and Hall, 1969].

The importance of coarse (one- or two-bit) quantization is stressed, as is the effect of oversampling, the use of a sampling interval less than the inverse of twice the signal bandwidth. For applications such as incoherent scatter in which the signal strength varies with range (i.e., time), multibit by one-bit multiplication combined with oversampling is probably the optimum strategy, although it requires 32% more integration time than the full multibit by multibit technique. For very high speed sampling of a signal of which the mean amplitude is constant, a three-level by three-level technique offers many advantages. It is nearly as simple to implement as conventional one-bit correlation but requires considerably less integration time to achieve equal statistical accuracy (only 26% more than full multibit correlation, when sampled at twice the Nyquist rate, as compared to 146% for a one-bit correlator with sampling at only the Nyquist rate).","doi":"10.1029/RS008i008p00775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7773109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS008i008p00775","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7773109/07773117.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital-correlation techniques in radio science","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.-Sept.  1973","displayDocTitle":"Digital-correlation techniques in radio science","volume":"8","issue":"8-9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.-Sept.  1973","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.-Sept. 1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7773117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital-correlation techniques in radio science","sourcePdf":"rds735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062591S","chronDate":"Aug.-Sept.  1973","isNumber":"7773109","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"51","articleId":"7773117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7773171,"authors":[{"name":"James R.

The synchrotron radiation from the incoming auroral electrons indeed offers an explanation for the observations of auroral noise observed at College, Alaska.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7773573","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7773573/07773579.pdf","doi":"10.1029/RS006i008p00775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS006i008p00775","startPage":"775","endPage":"780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchrotron radiation from auroral electrons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.-Sept.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.-Sept.  1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7773579/","displayDocTitle":"Synchrotron radiation from auroral electrons","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"8-9","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug.-Sept. 1971","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchrotron radiation from auroral electrons","sourcePdf":"rds441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068544S","chronDate":"Aug.-Sept.  1971","isNumber":"7773573","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7773579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7773779,"authors":[{"name":"Guanjun Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guanjun","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Zhaohui Song","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Song"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7773779","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Radio communication links through the solar corona are disturbed by electron density fluctuations caused by coronal turbulence.

To date over 100 satellites have been launched to provide both domestic and overseas commercial (i e., non-military) communications services and this paper largely confines itself to describing the technical developments involved in creating the INTELSAT system which are representative of the field as a whole INTELSAT, is an international organization established in 1964 to provide overseas communications It has developed a global system designed to provide (1) a high degree of connectivity and (2) a large communications capacity. Connectivity has been achieved using relatively broad (albeit \u201cshaped\u201d) satellite antenna patterns permitting earth stations in many countries that are illuminated by the same beam to be interconnected. This desirable attribute has, however, required the use of large earth stations and one future technical direction is likely to entail using satellites that generate narrow pencil beams permitting the use of smaller earth stations; on-board switching will then be required to restore connectivity between beams. A large capacity has been achieved through the use of \u201cfrequency reuse,\u201d i e., techniques to utilize the C-band frequencies assigned for satellite communications several-fold This has been accomplished through satellite designs that employ isolated antenna beams to illuminate different parts of the earth and/or beams that view overlapping parts but employ opposite senses of (circular) polarization. Associated with this approach have been efforts to use the assigned bands as efficiently as possible through \u201cchannelization,\u201d i.e., subdividing them into frequency intervals, each of which is served by a transponder amplifier designed to yield minimum interference with its neighbors. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the likely trends in the design of satellite systems as these evolve in competition with fiber-optic cables.","doi":"10.1029/RS021i004p00647","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7773782/07773795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS021i004p00647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7773782","startPage":"647","endPage":"664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twenty years of international satellite communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7773795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","displayDocTitle":"Twenty years of international satellite communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7773795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twenty years of international satellite communication","sourcePdf":"rds2642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025051S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1986","isNumber":"7773782","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7773795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7773839,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The numerical results also show that the proposed architecture requires as few as 184, 210, and 223 slices for 16 \u00d7 16, 64 \u00d7 64, and 128 \u00d7 128 MIMO systems, respectively, which is significantly less than that required by known designs of the MMSE detector. By comparing the serial and parallel implementations of the box-constrained detector, we show that the parallel implementation requires 15% fewer clock cycles.","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7773903/07773909.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2016RS006021","doi":"10.1002/2016RS006021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7773903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA design of box-constrained DCD-based detector for large-scale MIMO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"FPGA design of box-constrained DCD-based detector for large-scale MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7773909/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","volume":"51","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA design of box-constrained DCD-based detector for large-scale MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"rds20393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041243S","chronDate":"July  2016","isNumber":"7773903","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7773909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7773964,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Gong","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Gong"},{"name":"Yuanmei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Yuanmei","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7773964","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave FET integrated circuits","Microwave imaging","Microwave integrated circuits","Microwave theory and techniques","Neural networks","Image reconstruction","Neurons"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7773964","abstract":"A neural network approach to the inverse scattering problem for microwave tomographic reconstruction is presented. Although the technique of microwave tomography has been developed for more than two decades, it is still in its infancy in that it is necessary to solve the inverse scattering problem, which is well known as an ill-posed and nonlinear problem and therefore difficult to deal with. To improve the inherent ill-posedness of the problem, good regularization procedures are required. In this paper, an edge-preserving regularization is proposed with a set of line processes to preserve the edge of the reconstructed image. Since the unknown dielectric permittivities are continuous complex variables and the line processes are binary variables, an augmented Hopfield network is applied to the mixed-variable optimization problem. With this method, a priori knowledge can be conveniently incorporated into the optimization process, and inversions of large matrices are avoided. A numerical example of a simple model illuminated by the transverse magnetic incident waves is reported, and the advantages and limitations of the method are discussed.","doi":"10.1029/2000RS002511","startPage":"825","endPage":"832","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2000RS002511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7773936","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7773936/07773964.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to the microwave inverse scattering problem with edge-preserving regularization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7773964/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to the microwave inverse scattering problem with edge-preserving regularization","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2001","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  2001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to the microwave inverse scattering problem with edge-preserving regularization","sourcePdf":"rds4625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028711S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2001","isNumber":"7773936","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7773964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7773970,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Jim\u00e9nez","affiliation":["Department of Radio and Space Science, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Jim\u00e9nez"},{"name":"Patrick Eriksson","affiliation":["Department of Radio and Space Science, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Eriksson"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7773970","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Atmospheric modeling","Training","Atmospheric measurements","Microwave radiometry","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7773970","abstract":"The limb sounder radiometer on board the satellite Odin will be the first instrument measuring emission from space in the sub-millimeter region to map atmospheric species. Nonlinear inversions of Odin spectra by traditional iterative approaches will be computationally very intensive, so this paper proposes a faster inversion technique based on training neural networks. The technique is described first in general terms and then applied to invert simulated observations in two of the Odin bands, around 501.4 GHz and 544.6 GHz. To deal with the large dimension of the measured spectra, a data reduction based on the eigenvectors of the measured space is first applied. The reduced spectra are then input to a set of multilayer perceptrons that, after training with a set of simulated spectra, do the inversions. The same spectra are also inverted by optimal estimation, and the performance from both techniques is compared. The neural network technique retrieves species profiles with errors and vertical resolutions comparable to optimal estimation, it can be made very robust against the uncertainties of the a priori information by including different learning terms during the training, and it is faster than optimal estimation if nonlinear inversions are required. Although final conclusions on processing time have to wait until Odin is operational, the simulations show that the neural network technique has the potential to make the Odin nonlinear inversions at least 1 order of magnitude faster than they are made by optimal estimation.","doi":"10.1029/2000RS002561","startPage":"941","endPage":"953","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2000RS002561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7773936","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7773936/07773970.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network technique for inversion of atmospheric observations from microwave limb sounders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7773970/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network technique for inversion of atmospheric observations from microwave limb sounders","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2001","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  2001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network technique for inversion of atmospheric observations from microwave limb sounders","sourcePdf":"rds4666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021002S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2001","isNumber":"7773936","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7773970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7773974,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Lieh Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Lieh","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Shao-Hon Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Hon","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Chih-Ming Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Ming","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Chien-Ching Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Ching","lastName":"Chiu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7773974","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7773974","abstract":"This paper presents a computational approach to the imaging of a partially immersed perfectly conducting cylinder by the steady state genetic algorithm.

Using the differential-times-of-arrival of lightning sferics recorded by three or more stations, the latitudes and longitudes of the source discharges were determined. Under conditions of favorable geometry and ionospheric propagation, sensors obtained ionospherically reflected skywave signals from the lightning discharges in addition to the standard groundwave sferics. In approximately 1% of all waveforms, automated processing identified two 1-hop skywave reflection paths with delays indicative of an intracloud (height greater than 5 km) lightning source origin. For these events it was possible to determine both the height of the source above ground and the virtual reflection height of the ionosphere. Ionosphere heights agreed well with published values of 60 to 95 km with an expected diurnal variation. Source height determinations for 100,000+ intracloud lightning events ranged from 7 to 20 km AGL with negative-polarity events occurring above \u223c15 km and positive-polarity events occurring below \u223c15 km. The negative-polarity events are at a suprisingly high altitude and may be associated with discharges between the upper charge layer of a storm and a screening layer of charge above the storm. Approximately 100 of the intracloud events with LASA height determinations were also recorded by VHF receivers on the FORTE satellite. Independent FORTE source height estimates based on delays between direct and ground-reflected radio emissions showed excellent correlation with the VLF/LF estimates, but with a +1 km bias for the VLF/LF height determinations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2004","volume":"39","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2004","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A method for determining intracloud lightning and ionospheric heights from VLF/LF electric field records","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for determining intracloud lightning and ionospheric heights from VLF/LF electric field records","sourcePdf":"rds4931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06053S","chronDate":"Feb.  2004","isNumber":"7774003","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"17","articleId":"7774007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":7774177,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Kwang Chou","affiliation":["Bioelectromagnetics Research Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, RJ-30, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98195"],"firstName":"Chung-Kwang","lastName":"Chou"},{"name":"Arthur W.

The uniform grid limits the utility of the CG-FFHT method since it is not the most efficient way to discretize a problem, especially when there are fine structures in the geometry. These limitations are removed in this work by the use of the newly developed nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) and nonuniform fast Hankel transform (NUFHT) algorithms. The combination of the CG procedures and NUFFT and NUFHT leads to the CG-NUFFHT method. It retains the computational efficiency of the CG-FFHT method but has the flexibility of a nonuniform grid.

It is shown that those modes become leaky in that range; with the aid of the steepest-descent plane, one finds that the continuous spectrum can be characterized in a highly convergent manner by essentially a single leaky mode. The leakage occurs in two forms: a surface wave and a space wave. For structures without a top cover, it is found that almost all of the leakage is in the form of a space wave, so that an efficient leaky-wave antenna of particularly simple configuration may be designed that consists of just a length of uniform microstrip line fed in its first higher mode. An accurate leaky-wave analysis is developed that explains quantitatively the performance features and the limitations of this class of antennas.","doi":"10.1029/RS022i006p00907","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7768854/07774299.pdf","startPage":"907","endPage":"912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7768854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS022i006p00907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leakage from higher modes on microstrip line with application to antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Leakage from higher modes on microstrip line with application to antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774299/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"06","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage from higher modes on microstrip line with application to antennas","sourcePdf":"rds2768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050629S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"7768854","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"153","articleId":"7774299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7774304,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This extreme edge of the network is the WiFi Access Point (AP) or the wireless gateway through which all end-device traffic (personal devices, sensors, etc.) passes through. ParaDrop's focus on WiFi APs also stems from the fact that the WiFi AP has unique contextual knowledge of its end-devices (e.g., proximity, channel characteristics) that are lost as we get deeper into the network. While different variations and implementations of edge computing platforms have been created over the last decade, ParaDrop focuses on specific design issues around how to structure an architecture, a programming interface, and orchestration framework through which such edge computing services can be dynamically created, installed, and revoked. ParaDrop consists of the following three main components: a flexible hosting substrate in the WiFi APs that supports multi-tenancy, a cloud-based backend through which such computations are orchestrated across many ParaDrop APs, and an API through which third-party developers can deploy and manage their computing functions across such different ParaDrop APs. We have implemented and deployed the entire ParaDrop framework and, in this paper, describe its overall architecture and our initial experiences using it as an edge computing platform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ParaDrop: Enabling Lightweight Multi-tenancy at the Network\u2019s Extreme Edge","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2016.39","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774234/7774340/07774349.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2016.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"ParaDrop: Enabling Lightweight Multi-tenancy at the Network\u2019s Extreme Edge","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774349/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523156","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ParaDrop: Enabling Lightweight Multi-tenancy at the Network\u2019s Extreme Edge","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3322a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082466S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774234","isNumber":"7774340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774234","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7774340","articleId":"7774349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7774352,"authors":[{"name":"Abhimanyu Gosain","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Abhimanyu","lastName":"Gosain","id":"37546834700"},{"name":"Mark Berman","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Berman","id":"37085552951"},{"name":"Marshall Brinn","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Marshall","lastName":"Brinn","id":"37269466000"},{"name":"Thomas Mitchell","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"37086088394"},{"name":"Chuan Li","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37074742700"},{"name":"Yuehua Wang","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"firstName":"Yuehua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086090410"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37086089165"},{"name":"Jing Hua","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Hua","id":"37285799200"},{"name":"Hongwei Zhang","affiliation":["Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3322-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3323-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774352","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1013},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774352","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Vehicles","Network topology","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cloud computing","mobile computing","next generation networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["campus edge computing","GENI racks","mobile resources","GENI edge cloud computing network","storage resources","mobile 4G cellular edge","campus network","layer-2 network","vehicular sensing","police patrol cars","Wayne State University campus","public safety surveillance","vehicle internal-state sensing","next generation","vehicle technologies","local edge computing cloud infrastructure","latency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GENI Racks","Distributed Testbeds","Network Slicing","Mobile Edge Computing","Virtual Basestation","4G small cell","Vehicular Networks","Connected Automated Vehicles (CAV)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the architecture of GENI edge cloud computing network in the form of compute and storage resources, a mobile 4G cellular edge and a high speed campus network connecting these components.

In the design process of Hall thruster, a numerical simulation called Full-PIC (Particle-In-Cell) method is used. Although this simulation provides high accurate result, it is known as a very time consuming job. In this paper, we present a study of acceleration of Full-PIC simulation on a CPU-FPGA tightly coupled environment. A high-load part is selected and off-loaded to an FPGA.

Integrating hardware accelerators in a cloud environment is the optimal way to improve the quality of service. However, mapping all possible application statically into the reconfigurable fabric of the FPGA is rather impractical and prohibitively expensive in terms of resource and power consumption. This problem can be alleviated via time multiplexing the access to the underlying hardware resources by designing dynamically reconfigurable accelerators in the cloud. Two cloud service: Reconfigurable IPs as a Service (RIPaaS) and Reconfigurable Region as a Service (RRaaS) are considered in this paper. Similarly, the connection and communication between the accelerators and the reconfigurable control will not be efficient without the use of Network-on-Chip (NoC). In order to address these issues, we propose a NoC based virtualized accelerators for cloud computing. Reconfigurable accelerators communicate their status and exchange data through the routers connected to them. A Hypervisor is used as an intermediate level between the physical reconfigurable hardware and application layer to manage the FPGA resources. A 2\u00d72-mesh NoC based reconfigurable accelerators for image analysis and matrix computation are implemented and tested showing a promising result for more scalable systems in cloud computing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NoC Based Virtualized Accelerators for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2016.21","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774235/7774403/07774430.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2016.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774403","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"NoC Based Virtualized Accelerators for Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774430/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523230","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NoC Based Virtualized Accelerators for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"3531a133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063217S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774235","isNumber":"7774403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774235","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7774403","articleId":"7774430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774431,"authors":[{"name":"Kazushi Yamashina","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazushi","lastName":"Yamashina","id":"37086009233"},{"name":"Hitomi Kimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hitomi","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37086012935"},{"name":"Takeshi Ohkawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ohkawa","id":"37284454400"},{"name":"Kanemitsu Ootsu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kanemitsu","lastName":"Ootsu","id":"37270171900"},{"name":"Takashi Yokota","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Utsunomiya University, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Yokota","id":"37085987638"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3531-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3532-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774431","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Software","Hardware","Robots","Productivity","Design tools","Peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","mobile robots","operating systems (computers)","programmable circuits","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-software co-design","programmable SoC","hardware circuitry","ROS-based software","HDL-based design","autonomous mobile robots","ROS-compliant FPGA component","automated design tool","cReComp"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Programmable SoC","Component oriented development","ROS","ROS-compliant FPGA component","Robot"]}],"abstract":"Autonomous mobile robots require high-performance computation to meet variety of requirements of functions, such as sensing, intelligent image processing and controlling actuators. We focus on FPGA as a hardware platform for autonomous mobile robot system. However, a FPGA-based system is not effective in development cost, since it requires HDL-based design whose productivity is relatively low. In order to solve this problem, we have already proposed a design principle of ROS-compliant FPGA component, which is effective in easy integration of a FPGA device into any robot system. Although it allows ROS-based software to access easily to hardware circuitry in FPGA, high development cost of HDL-based circuitry still remains as a large problem. So, in this paper, we propose cReComp which is an automated design tool to improve productivity of ROS-compliant FPGA component. cReComp generates codes of interface software and hardware automatically. We evaluate cReComp from two major aspects: improvements in design productivity, and operation speed of generated FPGA components by cReComp. Experimental results show that only less than one hour is enough for novice designers to implement a ROS-compliant FPGA component into programmable SoC. Furthermore, our results reveal that generated FPGA component operates 1.85 times faster than the original software-based component.","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2016.47","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774235/7774403/07774431.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2016.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774403","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"cReComp: Automated Design Tool for ROS-Compliant FPGA Component","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774431/","displayDocTitle":"cReComp: Automated Design Tool for ROS-Compliant FPGA Component","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774431/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523194","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"cReComp: Automated Design Tool for ROS-Compliant FPGA Component","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"3531a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074605S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774235","isNumber":"7774403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774235","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7774403","articleId":"7774431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7774437,"authors":[{"name":"Abdoulaye Gamati\u00e9","affiliation":["LIRMM (CNRS / Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier), Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Abdoulaye","lastName":"Gamati\u00e9","id":"37266787000"},{"name":"Roman Ursu","affiliation":["LIRMM (CNRS / Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier), Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Ursu","id":"37086066269"},{"name":"Manuel Selva","affiliation":["LIRMM (CNRS / Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier), Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Selva","id":"37085490830"},{"name":"Gilles Sassatelli","affiliation":["LIRMM (CNRS / Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier), Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Sassatelli","id":"37298938600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3531-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3532-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774437","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774437","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Encoding","Resource management","Training","Data mining","Measurement","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","multiprocessing systems","neural nets","performance evaluation","resource allocation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application mapping performance prediction","manycore systems","artificial neural networks","smarter high-performance embedded systems","on-chip systems","optimal resource allocation","energy requirements","learning technique","dynamic resource allocation decision improvement","automotive applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application mapping","Manycore","Performance","Prediction model","Artificial Neural Networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2016.17","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774235/7774403/07774437.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","startPage":"185","endPage":"192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2016.17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Prediction of Application Mapping in Manycore Systems with Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"The growing demand for smarter high-performance embedded systems leads to the integration of multiple functionalities in on-chip systems with tens (even hundreds) of cores.

Modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) such as the Tegra K1 employ advanced power management capabilities such as two CPU clusters, clock-gating, power-gating and dynamic frequency tuning to meet application demands. At design or runtime phases, it is challenging for system architects and software developers to understand the effects that these mechanisms have in terms of power and performance in all parts of the system. This is because it is impossible to measure directly the power usage of cores, caches, memory and other hardware components. Rate based power models are often proposed as a solution for this, unfortunately these can mispredict substantially on the Tegra K1 up to 30 %. In this paper, we propose a power modelling method for the Tegra K1 CPU which overcomes the limitations of the most common types of models found in literature, but still only requires power measurement of the board. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate an accuracy which is close to 100 %. Preliminary experiments show that our methodology is able to capture instruction power of individual system processes and applications and produce detailed power breakdowns of all components in the system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rails","Hardware","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Power measurement","Clocks","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","energy conservation","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","power aware computing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power management capabilities","CPU clusters","clock-gating","power-gating","dynamic frequency tuning","Tegra K1 CPU","power measurement","instruction power","detailed power breakdowns","SoC","systems-on-chip","powerhungry hardware","limited battery lifetime","embedded systems","energy efficiency","Tegra K1 variable SMP processor architecture","high-precision power modelling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774438","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2016.28","startPage":"193","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774235/7774403/07774438.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2016.28","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774438/","displayDocTitle":"High-Precision Power Modelling of the Tegra K1 Variable SMP Processor Architecture","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16523231","htmlLink":"/document/7774438/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Precision Power Modelling of the Tegra K1 Variable SMP Processor Architecture","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"3531a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058193S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774235","isNumber":"7774403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774235","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7774403","articleId":"7774438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7774453,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"},{"name":"Michael Gla\u00df","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gla\u00df","id":"37355962600"},{"name":"Sascha Roloff","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Sascha","lastName":"Roloff","id":"38233418500"},{"name":"Wolfgang Schr\u00f6der-Preikschat","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Schr\u00f6der-Preikschat","id":"38273129600"},{"name":"Gregor Snelting","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Gregor","lastName":"Snelting","id":"37329675000"},{"name":"Andreas Weichslgartner","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Weichslgartner","id":"37704119200"},{"name":"Stefan Wildermann","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wildermann","id":"37669339300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3531-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3532-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774453","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774453","abstract":"The predictability of execution qualities including timeliness, power consumption, and fault-tolerability is of utmost importance for the successful introduction of multi-core architectures in embedded systems requiring guarantees rather than best effort behavior. Examples are real-time and/or safety-critical parallel applications. In particular for future many-core architectures, analysis tools for proving such properties to hold for a given application irrespective of other workload either suffer from computational complexity. Or, sound bounds are of no practical interest due to severe interferences of resources and software at multiple levels. In view of abundant computational and memory resources becoming available, we propose to apply the principles of invasive computing to avoid sharing of resources at run time as much as possible. We subsequently show that statically proven quality guarantees may be enforced on many multi-core architectures by a presented hybrid mapping approach. Rather than fixed resource mappings, this approach provides only constellations of resource allocations to the run-time system that searches for such constellations and assigns the invader a suitable claim of resources, if possible. We have implemented this hybrid approach and the interface to the language InvadeX10, a library-based extension of the X10 programming language. In this extension, so-called requirements on execution qualities such as deadlines (e.g., in the form of latency constraints) may be annotated to individual programs or even program segments. These are then translated into satisfying resource constellations that need to be found at run time prior to admitting a parallel application to start, respectively continue in view of required execution quality requirements.

In particular, one other major objectiveof our approach is to help CSP administrators to identify theanomalous VM at the origin of the detected SLA violation, whichshould enable them to proactively plan for appropriate recoverystrategies. To this end, we make use of virtual machine (VM)monitoring data and perform both a per-VM and an ensembleanalysis. Our approach includes a supervised machine learningalgorithm as well as fault injection tools. The experimental testbedconsists of a virtual IP Multimedia Subsystem developed by theClearwater project. Experimental results show that our approachcan achieve high precision and recall, and low false alarm rateand can pinpoint the root anomalous VNF VM causing SLAviolations.

Logs, which record system runtime information, are widely used for anomaly detection. Traditionally, developers (or operators) often inspect the logs manually with keyword search and rule matching. The increasing scale and complexity of modern systems, however, make the volume of logs explode, which renders the infeasibility of manual inspection. To reduce manual effort, many anomaly detection methods based on automated log analysis are proposed. However, developers may still have no idea which anomaly detection methods they should adopt, because there is a lack of a review and comparison among these anomaly detection methods. Moreover, even if developers decide to employ an anomaly detection method, re-implementation requires a nontrivial effort. To address these problems, we provide a detailed review and evaluation of six state-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection methods, including three supervised methods and three unsupervised methods, and also release an open-source toolkit allowing ease of reuse. These methods have been evaluated on two publicly-available production log datasets, with a total of 15,923,592 log messages and 365,298 anomaly instances. We believe that our work, with the evaluation results as well as the corresponding findings, can provide guidelines for adoption of these methods and provide references for future development.","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.2016.21","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774240/7774490/07774521.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.2016.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience Report: System Log Analysis for Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774521/","displayDocTitle":"Experience Report: System Log Analysis for Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523593","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774521/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience Report: System Log Analysis for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"9002a207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082601S","chronDate":"23-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774240","isNumber":"7774490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774240","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"7774490","articleId":"7774521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7774525,"authors":[{"name":"Riad Akram","affiliation":["University of Texas, San Antonio"],"firstName":"Riad","lastName":"Akram","id":"37086182679"},{"name":"Mohammad Mejbah Ul Alam","affiliation":["University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, US"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mejbah Ul","lastName":"Alam"},{"name":"Abdullah Muzahid","affiliation":["University of Texas, San Antonio"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Muzahid","id":"37990890300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9002-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9003-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6549"}],"articleNumber":"7774525","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774525","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Computer crashes","Runtime","Benchmark testing","Distance measurement","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","multi-threading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate computing","approximate lock","ALock","PARSEC benchmarks","SPLASH2 benchmarks","STAMP benchmarks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multithreaded program","Lock","Approximate computing","Accuracy","Performance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.2016.49","endPage":"263","startPage":"253","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774240/7774490/07774525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.2016.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Lock: Trading off Accuracy for Performance by Skipping Critical Sections","abstract":"Approximate computing is gaining a lot of traction due to its potential for improving performance and consequently, energy efficiency. This project explores the potential for approximating locks. We start out with the observation that many applications can tolerate occasional skipping of computations done inside a critical section protected by a lock. This means that for certain critical sections, when the enclosed computation is occasionally skipped, the application suffers from quality degradation in the final outcome but it never crashes/deadlocks. To exploit this opportunity, we propose Approximate Lock (ALock). The thread executing ALock checks if a certain condition (e.g., high contention, long waiting time) is met and if so, the thread returns without acquiring the lock. We modify some selected critical sections using ALock so that those sections are skipped when ALock returns without acquiring the lock. We experimented with 14 programs from PARSEC, SPLASH2, and STAMP benchmarks. We found a total of 37 locks that can be transformed into ALock. ALock provides performance improvement for 10 applications, ranging from 1.8% to 164.4%, with at least 80% accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774525/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774525/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16523569","conferenceDate":"23-27 Oct. 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Lock: Trading off Accuracy for Performance by Skipping Critical Sections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Lock: Trading off Accuracy for Performance by Skipping Critical Sections","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"9002a253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07459S","chronDate":"23-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774240","isNumber":"7774490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774240","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7774490","articleId":"7774525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7774560,"authors":[{"name":"Kristen Gardner","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Kristen","lastName":"Gardner","id":"37085696336"},{"name":"Mor Harchol-Balter","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Mor","lastName":"Harchol-Balter","id":"38273775500"},{"name":"Alan Scheller-Wolf","affiliation":["Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Scheller-Wolf","id":"38312425700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3432-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3433-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"7774560","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Better Model for Job Redundancy: Decoupling Server Slowdown and Job Size","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774560","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Redundancy","Analytical models","Time factors","Computational modeling","Runtime","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["queueing theory","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["job redundancy","decoupling server slowdown","job size","computer systems research","redundant requests","multiple servers","server-side variability","network interrupts","garbage collection","queueing theorists","exact analysis","analytical tractability","independent runtimes model","IR model","server-side slowdown","redundant-to-idle-queue","RIQ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Redundancy","replication","dispatching"]}],"abstract":"Recent computer systems research has proposed using redundant requests to reduce latency. The idea is to replicate a request so that it joins the queue at multiple servers. The request is considered complete as soon as any one copy of the request completes. Redundancy is beneficial because it allows us to overcome server-side variability - the fact that the server we choose might be temporarily slow due to factors such as background load, network interrupts, and garbage collection. When there is significant server-side variability, replicating requests can greatly reduce response times. In the past few years, queueing theorists have begun to study redundancy, first via approximations, and, more recently, via exact analysis. Unfortunately, for analytical tractability, most existing theoretical analysis has assumed an Independent Runtimes (IR) model, wherein the replicas of a job each experience independent runtimes (service times) at different servers. The IR model is unrealistic and has led to theoretical results which can be at odds with computer systems implementation results. This paper introduces a much more realistic model of redundancy. Our model allows us to decouple the inherent job size (X) from the server-side slowdown (S), where we track both S and X for each job. Analysis within the S&X model is, of course, much more difficult. Nevertheless, we design a policy, Redundant-to-Idle-Queue (RIQ) which is both analytically tractable within the S&X model and has provably excellent performance.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.43","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774237/7774549/07774560.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.43","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Better Model for Job Redundancy: Decoupling Server Slowdown and Job Size","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774560/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523309","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774560/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Better Model for Job Redundancy: Decoupling Server Slowdown and Job Size","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"3432a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072716S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774237","isNumber":"7774549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774237","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7774549","articleId":"7774560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7774564,"authors":[{"name":"Pooyan Jamshidi","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Pooyan","lastName":"Jamshidi","id":"37304224300"},{"name":"Giuliano Casale","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Giuliano","lastName":"Casale","id":"37271948500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3432-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3433-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"7774564","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Radiation detectors","Response surface methodology","Tuning","Bayes methods","Benchmark testing","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","iterative methods","optimisation","parallel processing","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertainty-aware approach","optimal configuration","stream processing systems","SPS","tuning methods","Bayesian Optimization for Configuration Optimization","BO4CO","auto-tuning algorithm","Gaussian processes","GP","posterior distribution iterative capturing","Apache Storm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big Data","Machine Learning","Stream Processing System","Performance Tuning","Software Performance Engineering","Bayesian Optimization","DevOps","Software Variability","Auto-tuning"]}],"abstract":"Finding optimal configurations for Stream Processing Systems (SPS) is a challenging problem due to the large number of parameters that can influence their performance and the lack of analytical models to anticipate the effect of a change. To tackle this issue, we consider tuning methods where an experimenter is given a limited budget of experiments and needs to carefully allocate this budget to find optimal configurations. We propose in this setting Bayesian Optimization for Configuration Optimization (BO4CO), an auto-tuning algorithm that leverages Gaussian Processes (GPs) to iteratively capture posterior distributions of the configuration spaces and sequentially drive the experimentation. Validation based on Apache Storm demonstrates that our approach locates optimal configurations within a limited experimental budget, with an improvement of SPS performance typically of at least an order of magnitude compared to existing configuration algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Uncertainty-Aware Approach to Optimal Configuration of Stream Processing Systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.17","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774237/7774549/07774564.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774549","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Uncertainty-Aware Approach to Optimal Configuration of Stream Processing Systems","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774564/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523300","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Uncertainty-Aware Approach to Optimal Configuration of Stream Processing Systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"3432a039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.178186S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774237","isNumber":"7774549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774237","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7774549","articleId":"7774564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774568,"authors":[{"name":"Everett Neil Rush","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering & Computer Science, University of Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Everett Neil","lastName":"Rush","id":"37086019328"},{"name":"Nihat Altiparmak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering & Computer Science, University of Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Nihat","lastName":"Altiparmak","id":"37392796000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3432-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3433-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"7774568","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774568","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Performance evaluation","Computers","Data storage systems","Time factors","Energy storage","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","energy conservation","energy consumption","environmental factors","socio-economic effects","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance-aware replica selection technique","multidisk storage systems","economic impacts","energy-efficient data storage systems","carbon dioxide emissions","environmental impact","economic burden","data centers","energy consumption","digital data","heterogeneous storage systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["disk energy","replica selection","optimization"]}],"abstract":"As a result of immense growth of digital data in the last decade, energy consumption has become an important issue in data storage systems. In the US alone, data centers were projected to consume $4 billion (40 TWh) yearly electricity in 2005. This cost had reached to $10 billion (100 TWh) in 2011, and expected to be around $20 billion (200 TWh) in 2016 by doubling itself every 5 years. In addition to the economic burden on companies and research institutions, these large scale data storage systems also have a negative impact on the environment. According to the EPA, generating 1 KWh of electricity in the US results in an average of 1.55 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. Considering a projected 200 TWh energy requirement for 2016, energy-efficient data storage systems can have a huge economic and environmental impacts on society. This project exploits replication and heterogeneity existing in modern multi-disk storage systems and proposes an energy-efficient and performance-aware replica selection technique to reduce the energy consumption of data storage systems without negatively affecting their performance. Our proposed technique exploits the difference between active and idle energy consumption in heterogeneous disks holding the same replica and selects replicas by balancing energy and performance.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.70","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774237/7774549/07774568.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Replication for Energy Efficiency of Heterogeneous Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Replication for Energy Efficiency of Heterogeneous Storage Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523244","htmlLink":"/document/7774568/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Replication for Energy Efficiency of Heterogeneous Storage Systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"3432a079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065416S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774237","isNumber":"7774549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774237","xplore-issue":"7774549","articleId":"7774568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774586,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Bodin","affiliation":["The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bodin","id":"37071303600"},{"name":"Luigi Nardi","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Nardi","id":"37085408295"},{"name":"Paul H.

As these new types of memory, which we refer to as New Memory (NM), are byte addressable and nonvolatile, they are anticipated to, partially or wholly, take on the role of main memory and storage. The goal of this study is to evaluate how the read/write latency gap between the DRAM and NM and the asymmetric read and write latency of NM will affect the performance of applications. To this end, using an in-house ARM based embedded system that allows us to individually adjust the read and write latency. First, we use controlled, synthetic workloads to evaluate the latency effects. The main finding here, among others, is that write latency has little effect on performance due to various hardware mechanisms employed in current cache hardware.

In this paper we show that recognition accuracy degrades when used in daily mobile scenarios due to context variations caused by different locations, time of a day, etc. To solve this problem, we present DeepCham - the first adaptive mobile object recognition framework that allows deep learning techniques to be used successfully in mobile environments. Specifically, DeepCham is mediated by an edge master server which coordinates with participating mobile users to collaboratively train a domain-aware adaptation model which can yield much better object recognition accuracy when used together with a domain-constrained deep model. DeepCham generates high-quality domain-aware training instances for adaptation from in-situ mobile photos using two major steps: (i) a distributed algorithm which identifies qualifying images stored in each mobile device for training, (ii) a user labeling process for recognizable objects identified from qualifying images using suggestions automatically generated by a generic deep model. Using a newly collected dataset with smartphone images collected from different locations, time of a day, and device types, we show that DeepCham improves the object recognition accuracy by 150% when compared to that achieved merely using a generic deep model. In addition, we investigated how major design factors affect the performance of DeepCham. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of DeepCham using an implemented prototype.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523164","htmlLink":"/document/7774674/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DeepCham: Collaborative Edge-Mediated Adaptive Deep Learning for Mobile Object Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepCham: Collaborative Edge-Mediated Adaptive Deep Learning for Mobile Object Recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3322a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102405S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774234","isNumber":"7774340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774234","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7774340","articleId":"7774674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774679,"authors":[{"name":"Guoyu Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guoyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085880335"},{"name":"Qibo Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qibo","lastName":"Sun","id":"37531906100"},{"name":"Ao Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085650351"},{"name":"Shangguang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shangguang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066696600"},{"name":"Jinglin Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinglin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086174354"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3322-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3323-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774679","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":565},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774679","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","metropolitan area networks","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloudlet placement","edge computing environment","connection features","adaptive comprehensive access point ranking method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge computing","mobile computing","cloudlet placement","access point ranking"]}],"abstract":"This poster addresses the problem of access point ranking for cloudlet placement in edge computing environment.

Particularly, cloud based framework is becoming insanely popular due to wide storage space and access through 5G wireless network, has made things easier and faster to access the cloud data [1]. 5GHealthNet is a cloud based framework, specifically storing the medical records and uses a double key encryption algorithm to secure cloud data. The main purpose of 5GHealthNet is to protect the private records and also enhance the authorized access to the cloud through wireless network. The 5G wireless network ensures remote access of the data via predefined network data centers. The framework ensures multi user access and uses data stream transfer to handle bulk records in case the user limit reaches beyond threshold. Energy consumption is a major issue in higher generation networks due to large number of functional nodes. Access through 5G wireless network must ensure certain prerequisites in order to achieve seamless data transfer [2]. Let i and j be the node set where the data transfer has to initiate. The above approach is solved using an integral linear problem. 5GHealthNet framework functionalities are as follows: 1. Faster and remote data access through 5G networks 2. Double encryption ensures secure data access 3. Multi user access 4. User friendly interface and easy usage Fig.1 shows the architecture of 5GHealthNet. A load balancer initiates the data stream transfer, SEMS (security and edge management system) is implemented using double encryption algorithm to ensure secure data access. DTB (data transport broker), DIP (data integration and processing) and PC (persistence and concurrency) modules ensure data flow within the cloud [3]. A backup copy of the data to be accessed is created every time the access request is raised. The control flow of the entire operation is monitored in API Library and API management which have the functionalities to ensure the access of private data. User connectivity is the important aspect of the proposed concept. Since the data access is through wireless networks, energy efficient methodology has to be thought of in order to efficiently use the functionalities of 5G wireless networks. The application has to support the inbuilt 5G connectivity with which secure cloud access can be done with fewer ambiguities. Since, 5G networks are in the stage of deployment, an alternate 4G connectivity has to be maintained for unambiguous data access. The prototype for double encryption algorithm is made by assuming that the key value is dynamic irrespective of the user count. The new key value is generated, every time the user logs in. A new decrypting key is generated when the generated new key value is successfully encrypted. Fig.2 shows the initial experimental setup. We have basically used a wireless mesh transmitter that connects the mobile device through antennas. For time being, we have implemented an algorithm in MATLAB to fetch 5 records from 5GHhealthNet connected to a mobile device via the wireless transmitter. We have also simulated graphical plots to calculate the probability of mean residual energy and data distortion. Fig.3 shows a device connected to various wireless nodes. The mobile device has an application that has access to 5GNetHealth. The ultimate goal of the proposed scheme is to implement the 5GNetHealth application in smartphones and via the internet connection, the cloud data is accessed with certain inbuilt security features incorporated within the application. Fig.4 calculates the mean residual energy for number of rounds of data transmission. Fig.5 calculates the probability of data distortion during cloud data transfer with the increase in cluster radius and distance d. In our experiment, we have explicitly used 3 wireless nodes connected to a system having access to cloud data. Smartphones using 5GHealthNet does not require wireless connection, as they have inbuilt internet connectivity to access the cloud data. 5GHealthNet is a framework or an interface that connects to the user end as well as to the data end to promote mutual communication and enhance ease of access. Consider a scenario, where the consulting physician has to look after the patient records: a separate login credentials are provided to access private data unless user/patient has explicitly granted permission to access his private-data. The main issue in 5GHealthNet lies in the connectivity of user end and data end and is solely dependent on the wireless connection provided through 5G networks. For large scale systems, more 5G wireless functional nodes are required to enhance the access speed.","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2016.19","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774234/7774340/07774681.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2016.19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Poster Abstract: 5GHealthNet \u2014 A Cloud Based Framework for Faster and Authorized Access to Private Medical Records through 5G Wireless Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Poster Abstract: 5GHealthNet \u2014 A Cloud Based Framework for Faster and Authorized Access to Private Medical Records through 5G Wireless Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774681/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16523158","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774681/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Poster Abstract: 5GHealthNet \u2014 A Cloud Based Framework for Faster and Authorized Access to Private Medical Records through 5G Wireless Network","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3322a089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032312S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774234","isNumber":"7774340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7774340","articleId":"7774681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7774683,"authors":[{"name":"Yujiong Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yujiong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086109075"},{"name":"Shangguang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shangguang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599736600"},{"name":"Fangchun Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangchun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292382500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3322-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3323-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774683","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1120},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Poster Abstract: A Multi-user Computation Offloading Algorithm Based on Game Theory in Mobile Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774234/7774340/07774683.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"94","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEC.2016.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774340","doi":"10.1109/SEC.2016.21","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Games","Algorithm design and analysis","Nash equilibrium","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","decision making","distributed algorithms","game theory","groupware","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["poster abstract","multiuser computation offloading algorithm","game theory","mobile cloud computing","energy consumption","time consumption","monetary cost","decision making","mobile device users","distributed computation offloading algorithm","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Cloud Computing","Computation Offloading","Game Theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774683","abstract":"Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) offers a new paradigm to relieve the pressure of soaring data demands and augment the capabilities of resource-poor mobile devices.

The common approach for stream processing is to transfer raw data streams to a central data center that entails communication over the wide-area network (WAN). However, this approach is inefficient and falls short for two main reasons: (i) the burst in the amount of data generated at the network edge by an increasing number of connected devices, (ii) the emergence of applications with predictable and low latency requirements. In this paper, we propose SpanEdge, a novel approach that unifies stream processing across a geo-distributed infrastructure, including the central and near-the-edge data centers. SpanEdge reduces or eliminates the latency incurred by WAN links by distributing stream processing applications across the central and the near-the-edge data centers. Furthermore, SpanEdge provides a programming environment, which allows programmers to specify parts of their applications that need to be close to the data source. Programmers can develop a stream processing application, regardless of the number of data sources and their geographical distributions. As a proof of concept, we implemented and evaluated a prototype of SpanEdge. Our results show that SpanEdge can optimally deploy the stream processing applications in a geo-distributed infrastructure, which significantly reduces the bandwidth consumption and the response latency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774234/7774340/07774704.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM

This strategy is based on the retention error characteristics of Multi-Level Cell (MLC) NAND flash memories. The raw bit error rate is estimated by an empirical formula of retention error increasing model. With the bit flip patterns caused by retention errors in a MLC NAND flash cell, the bit-granularity bit error rate (soft information) can be calculated according to the raw bit error rate (RBER). Then, the soft information is used as an input of the NB-LDPC decoder to accelerate the convergence of decoding process. The experimental results show that the proposed joint decoding strategy can reduce an average 20.5% of the time consumption of NB-LDPC decoding process (the maximum reduction reaches 65.1%). In addition, the error correction capability is almost doubled, while experiencing only little overhead.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2016.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2016.85","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774238/7774713/07774762.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Decoding Strategy of Non-binary LDPC Codes Based on Retention Error Characteristics for MLC NAND Flash Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Decoding Strategy of Non-binary LDPC Codes Based on Retention Error Characteristics for MLC NAND Flash Memories","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774762/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16523510","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Decoding Strategy of Non-binary LDPC Codes Based on Retention Error Characteristics for MLC NAND Flash Memories","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1195a183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.211195S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774238","isNumber":"7774713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774238","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7774713","articleId":"7774762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7774768,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Gao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37597944300"},{"name":"Deshun Hu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Deshun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086129601"},{"name":"Yongkui Ma","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yongkui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37592735600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1195-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-1194-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1196-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774768","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Frequency-domain analysis","Compressed sensing","Radar tracking","Finite element analysis","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","direction-of-arrival estimation","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction of arrival tracking","grid-refinement DOA tracking algorithm","least square compressive sensing","compressive sensing recovery","least square residual","sparsity pattern","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOA tracking","least square","compressive sensing","grid refinement"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel DOA tracking algorithm based on Least Square Compressive Sensing. The algorithm comes from the observation that a compressive sensing problem turns into a least square problem once the support is known. Utilizing the support from former time instant, compressive sensing recovery is performed on residual when least square residual is bigger than a threshold. In order to improve the resolution and decrease computation complexity, grid refinement is performed before least square. Under the assumption that the sparsity pattern of signal changes slowly, the grid refinement step is sufficient to track the DOA and the compressive sensing recovery step can be omitted in most of the time. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA tracking algorithm possess better performance and requires less computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2016.13","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774238/7774713/07774768.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2016.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid-Refinement Direction of Arrival Tracking via Least Square Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774768/","displayDocTitle":"Grid-Refinement Direction of Arrival Tracking via Least Square Compressive Sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16523488","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774768/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-Refinement Direction of Arrival Tracking via Least Square Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1195a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04142S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774238","isNumber":"7774713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774238","xplore-issue":"7774713","articleId":"7774768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774773,"authors":[{"name":"Yunhe Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing, China"],"firstName":"Yunhe","lastName":"Li","id":"37086118547"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"},{"name":"Shaohua Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shaohua","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407118000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1195-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-1194-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1196-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774773","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Signal reconstruction","Noise measurement","Compressed sensing","Thermal noise","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","quantisation (signal)","signal reconstruction","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing theory","low-rate sampling design","impulse radio ultrawideband signal","IR-UWB signal","quantization noise","resisting noise","noise distribution characteristics","signal reconstruction model","Dantzig-Selector method","subspace pursuit method","signal reconstruction method","self-adaptability","overload uniform quantization","overload hybrid DS-SP mechanism","digital rear-end","analog front-end"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing (CS)","impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB)","quantization noise","uniform quantization"]}],"abstract":"The compressed sensing(CS) theory has provided a new solution for the low-rate sampling design of Impulse Radio Ultra-WideBand (IR-UWB) signal.

Based on the analysis of noise distribution characteristics in compressed sampling value, the signal reconstruction model is revised, and then the performances of Dantzig-Selector (DS) method, Subspace Pursuit(SP) method, and traditional reconstruction algorithms are compared. On this basis, a signal reconstruction method (hybrid DS-SP method) with self-adaptability in DS and SP is proposed.

Recently, with the increasing needs for mobile and portable medical diagnoses, the development of medical ultrasound imaging algorithms on embedded platforms is flourishing. Among various medical ultrasound imaging algorithms, the typical delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm is a simple algorithm which is easy to realize a real-time embedded imaging implementation. However, this beamforming algorithm has relatively low image quality. As such, the implementation of high-quality minimum-variance adaptive beamforming algorithm for medical ultrasound imaging was studied on heterogeneous embedded computing platform which contained a high-performance embedded GPU. By applying the efficient implementation strategies, the embedded GPU implementation of the adaptive beamforming algorithm performed more than 100 times faster than its ARM processor implementation counterpart. Furthermore, scalability and power consumption of the embedded adaptive beamforming implementation were also evaluated, which demonstrated that the heterogeneous embedded computing platform utilized in this paper was suitable for a real-time mobile or portable high-quality medical ultrasound imaging device construction.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2016.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774713","startPage":"356","endPage":"360","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774238/7774713/07774799.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Embedded Implementation of Adaptive Beamforming for Medical Ultrasound Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7774799/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Embedded Implementation of Adaptive Beamforming for Medical Ultrasound Imaging","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16523420","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Embedded Implementation of Adaptive Beamforming for Medical Ultrasound Imaging","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1195a356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059037S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774238","isNumber":"7774713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774238","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7774713","articleId":"7774799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774820,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Gao","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37597944300"},{"name":"Linxiao Su","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Linxiao","lastName":"Su","id":"37085871835"},{"name":"Yanping Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600574500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1195-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-1194-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1196-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774820","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Cognitive radio","Optimization","MIMO","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","MIMO communication","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy sensing algorithm","cognitive MIMO","optimized energy detection approach","multiple secondary users","weighting factor","quadratic sum","combination factors","optimal weighting factors","spectrum resource","first-order derivative","second-order derivative","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum Sensing","Energy Detection","Cognitive MIMO","Unit Combination","Weighting Factors"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we concentrate on introducing an optimized energy detection approach applied to cognitive MIMO.

To avoid the pilot contamination issue, we firstly propose a simple equal gain combining scheme based only on the line-of-sight (LOS) component for a Ricean link in the uplink scenario with a single cell or multiple cells. Then we investigate the power-scaling law for the Ricean link when the transmit power is scaled down by the number of antennas at the base station (BS). We show by analytical results that when the number of BS antennas goes to infinity, the Ricean link can asymptotically achieve the same achievable rate as in the case with a single user, and the achievable rate is also asymptotically equal to that of the conventional maximal-ratio combining scheme based on both the LOS component and the imperfect scattered component. Finally, we provide several simulation examples through which we corroborate these analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LOS Component-Based Equal Gain Combining for Ricean Links in Uplink Massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2016.104","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774238/7774713/07774824.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2016.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"LOS Component-Based Equal Gain Combining for Ricean Links in Uplink Massive MIMO","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774824/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16523370","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LOS Component-Based Equal Gain Combining for Ricean Links in Uplink Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"1195a476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062465S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774238","isNumber":"7774713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774238","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7774713","articleId":"7774824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7774836,"authors":[{"name":"Kefei Lian","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, PR China"],"firstName":"Kefei","lastName":"Lian","id":"37086144067"},{"name":"Yunfeng Dong","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, PR China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37088907780"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1195-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-1194-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1196-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7774836","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Sliding mode control","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Force","Electromagnetic forces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial satellites","feedback","feedforward","Lyapunov methods","motion control","neurocontrollers","perturbation techniques","radial basis function networks","stability","trajectory control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory","relative motion maintenance","neural network adaptive law","Lyapunov stability theory","feedback sliding mode control","feed-forward control","external disturbance","parameter perturbation","CW equation","radial basis function neural network based sliding mode control","RBF neural network","electromagnetic satellite formation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sliding mode control","RBF neural network","electromagnetic satellite","formation flight"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2016.134","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774238/7774713/07774836.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Instrumentation & Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)","startPage":"532","endPage":"535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2016.134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Mode Control for Electromagnetic Satellite Formation Based on RBF Neural Network","abstract":"In this paper, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network based sliding mode control is presented.

Each column block of the parity check matrix was designed by adding circulant permutation sub-matrices one after another, provided the current parity check matrix has minimal number of short cycles. The condition for the proposed QC-LDPC codes to have girth at least 6 was also analyzed. Regular and irregular QC-LDPC codes with various lengths and rates can be constructed.

The proposed sampling system consists of two parts: a lower machine mainly designed by FPGA and four-quadrant analog multiplier, and an upper machine using computer. Lower machine is responsible for analog signal processing and sampling at a rate far below Nyquist rate, and the upper computer processes the acquired data and recovers the original signals. We exhibit experiment results from the designed system, especially provide waveforms of the pseudo-random sequences, mixed and filtered signals captured by oscilloscope.

From the users' perspective, the main concern is the performance of the submitted tasks, whereas, for the cloud service providers, reducing cost while providing the required service is critical. Therefore, there is a need for task scheduling mechanisms that balance users' performance requirements while being energy efficient. We present a time dependent Value of Service (VoS) metric that takes into consideration the arrival time of a task while evaluating the value of completing a task within its deadline and its energy consumption within a constraint. We consider the variation in value for completing a task at different times such that the value of energy reduction can change significantly between peak and non-peak periods. We use completion time and energy based value functions with soft and hard thresholds. Thus, we define the VoS for a given workload to be the sum of the values for all tasks that are executed during a given period of time. Our system model is based on virtual machines (VMs), where each task will be assigned a resource configuration characterized by the number of the homogeneous cores and amount of memory. Using VoS, we design, evaluate, and compare our task scheduling methods to show a significant improvement in energy consumption when considering time-of-use dependent scheduling algorithms. The experimental results are run on an IBM blade server using KVM. The experimental results show using time dependent VoS, 50% improvement in performance value, 40% improvement in energy value, and up to 91% improvement in VoS over a heuristic that only considers only the hard threshold of the value functions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAC.2016.22","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7771796/7774946/07774955.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAC.2016.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Value of Service Based Task Scheduling for Cloud Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Value of Service Based Task Scheduling for Cloud Computing Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523115","htmlLink":"/document/7774955/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Value of Service Based Task Scheduling for Cloud Computing Systems","confLoc":"Augsburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"3536a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102378S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7771796","isNumber":"7774946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7771796","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7774946","articleId":"7774955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7774977,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Han","affiliation":["Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7812807/7774977/han-2627040-small.gif","p":["Yong Han received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology from the Institute of Electronics of Chinese Academy of Sciences (IECAS), Beijing, China, in 2009.","He was an Assistant Researcher with the Key Laboratory of High Power Microwave Sources and Technologies, IECAS.

A jet-based Si microcooler with multiple drainage microtrenches (MDMTs) has been developed for microelectronic thermal management. Integrated with MDMT in hybrid microcooler, the negative cross-flow effect between nearby nozzles is eliminated, and thus fully developed jet impingement can be enabled for each nozzle. An inlet/outlet flow arrangement layer has been introduced to achieve uniform pressure distribution. The effects of three types of arrangement structures on the hydraulic and thermal performance of microcooler have been analyzed and compared. Two different thermal/fluid simulation models have been constructed for microcooler design. The test vehicle with the new nozzle/trench layer is fabricated using double-side deep reactive-ion etching process. Assembly of the stacked microcooler and Si thermal test chip is finished through two-steps optimized thermal compression bonding process. With 0.05-W pumping power for the microcooler, the heat dissipation of 260 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n has been demonstrated, and the chip temperature can be maintained under 51 \u00b0C.

The proposed X-ray line detector with TDI adopts pseudomultisampling (PMS) using shifted clocks for the single-slope analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to reduce the required clock cycles for the ADC. The reduced clock cycle decreases the dynamic power and power fluctuation to ensure power stability for large-sized X-ray detectors. The TDI X-ray line detector with PMS was fabricated using 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS image sensor process technology with a stitching process, which has an image format of 1010 \u00d7 86 and a pixel size of 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm.

Finite-time (or fixed-time) synchronization has been a hot topic in recent years, which means that the network can achieve synchronization in finite-time, and the settling time depends on the initial values for finite-time synchronization (or the settling time is bounded by a constant for any initial values for fixed-time synchronization). To realize the finite-time and fixed-time cluster synchronization, some simple distributed protocols with or without pinning control are designed and the effectiveness is rigorously proved. Several sufficient criteria are also obtained to clarify the effects of coupling terms for finite-time and fixed-time cluster synchronization. Especially, when the cluster number is one, the cluster synchronization becomes the complete synchronization problem; when the network has only one node, the coupling term between nodes will disappear, and the synchronization problem becomes the simplest master-slave case, which also includes the stability problem for nonlinear systems like neural networks. All these cases are also discussed. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the correctness of obtained theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2016.2630703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8207702/07774990.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2016.2630703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Time and Fixed-Time Cluster Synchronization With or Without Pinning Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774990/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Time and Fixed-Time Cluster Synchronization With or Without Pinning Control","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17447052","pubMedId":"28114053","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7774990/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Sciences Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673298, 61273211 and 61203149"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003395","fundingName":"\u201cChen Guang\u201d Project through the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation","grantNumber":"11CG22"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Time and Fixed-Time Cluster Synchronization With or Without Pinning Control","sourcePdf":"tcyb-chen-2630703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153989S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8207702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8207702","articleId":"7774990","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7774994,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Attia Abotabl","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7879183/7774994/abota-2636140-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Attia Abotabl (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Egypt, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nile University, Egypt.

Hierarchical modulations, which appear in the literature mostly in the context of unequal error protection, can approach only a few isolated points on the boundary of the broadcast capacity region. This paper studies multilevel coding (MLC) for constellation-constrained broadcast-coded modulation. The conditions under which multilevel codes can achieve the constellation-constrained capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel are derived. We propose a pragmatic multilevel design technique with near-constellation-constrained-capacity performance where the coupling of the superposition inner and outer codes is localized to each bit-level. It is shown that this can be further relaxed to a code coupling on only one bit-level, with a little or no penalty under natural labeling. The rate allocation problem between the bit levels of the two users is studied and a pragmatic method is proposed, again with near-capacity performance. In further pursuit of lower complexity, a hybrid MLC-bit-interleaved-coded modulation is proposed, whose performance is shown to be very close to the boundary of the constellation-constrained capacity region. Simulation results show that good point-to-point LDPC codes produce excellent performance in the proposed coded modulation framework.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7879183/7774994-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"65","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16743389","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7774994/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast Coded Modulation: Multilevel and Bit-Interleaved Construction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1219065 and 1546969"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Broadcast Coded Modulation: Multilevel and Bit-Interleaved Construction","sourcePdf":"tcomm-nosratinia-2636140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092765S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7879183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7879183","articleId":"7774994","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7774998,"authors":[{"name":"Kiryung Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kiryung Lee (M\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2012.

To overcome the ill-posedness of this problem, solutions based on priors tailored to specific practical application have been developed. In particular, sparsity models have provided promising priors. However, in spite of the empirical success of these methods in many applications, existing analyses are rather limited in two main ways: by disparity between the theoretical assumptions on the signal and/or measurement model versus practical setups; or by failure to provide a performance guarantee for parameter values within the optimal regime defined by the information theoretic limits. In particular, it has been shown that a naive sparsity model is not a strong enough prior for identifiability in the blind deconvolution problem. Instead, in addition to sparsity, we adopt a conic constraint, which enforces spectral flatness of the signals. Under this prior together with random dictionary models, we show that the unknown sparse signals can be recovered from samples of their convolution at a rate scaling near optimally with the problem parameters. We also propose an iterative algorithm that is guaranteed to provide robust recovery at the same near optimal sample complexity provided that certain projection steps in the algorithm are successful. In our analysis, we have not verified the success of these projection steps, but these steps are inactive with high probability. Numerical results show the empirical performance of the iterative algorithm agrees with the performance guarantee.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2636204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7823065/07774998.pdf","endPage":"821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Recovery of Sparse Signals From Subsampled Convolution","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2636204","startPage":"802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7774998","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7823065/7774998-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Blind Recovery of Sparse Signals From Subsampled Convolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7774998/","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598424","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7774998/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 14-22540, IIS 14-47879 and DMS 15-01103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Blind Recovery of Sparse Signals From Subsampled Convolution","sourcePdf":"tit-lee-2636204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17948S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7823065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7823065","articleId":"7774998","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7775000,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Dai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Dai","orcid":"0000-0003-3522-6627","id":"37086108408"},{"name":"Rongke Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rongke","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289647500"},{"name":"Yi Hou","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085539861"},{"name":"Ling Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085520701"},{"name":"Zhen Mei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K."],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Mei","id":"37085769538"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7775000","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775000","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability density function","Optimization","Decoding","Iterative decoding","TV","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","impulse noise","iterative methods","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EXIT chart aided LDPC code design","symmetric alpha-stable impulsive noise","iterative analysis method","extrinsic information transfer chart","quantized density evolution","low-density paritycheck codes","channel capacity","bit-error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","EXIT chart","impulsive noise","symmetric alpha-stable distribution"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an iterative analysis method based on an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart and quantized density evolution is developed for low-density paritycheck (LDPC) codes over channels with symmetric alpha-stable (S\u03b1S) impulsive noise.

The data-driven equivalent dynamic linearization, as a foundational analysis tool of data-driven control methods for discrete-time nonlinear systems, is introduced in detail with motivations and distinct features. The prototype model-free adaptive control schemes by using the dynamic linearization to an unknown nonlinear plant model, as well as the alternative model-free adaptive control methods by using the dynamic linearization to an unknown ideal nonlinear controller, are discussed. Furthermore, the extensions of the dynamic linearization to unknown nonlinear repetitive systems and the corresponding model-free adaptive iterative learning control methods are also overviewed and summarized. This work highlights the characteristics and comments of the different model-free adaptive control schemes in detail to facilitate the understanding of the readers. Finally, some perspectives on data-driven control methods in information-rich age are given.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7895231/07775006.pdf","startPage":"4076","endPage":"4090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2636126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2636126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7895231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of Dynamic-Linearization-Based Data-Driven Control and Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Adaptation models","Control systems","Data models","Nonlinear systems","Adaptive control","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","iterative learning control","linearisation techniques","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent dynamic linearization","data-driven control","model-based control","discrete-time nonlinear systems","prototype model-free adaptive control","nonlinear plant model","nonlinear controller","nonlinear repetitive systems","model-free adaptive iterative learning control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven control (DDC)","dynamic linearization (DL)","iterative learning control (ILC)","model-based control (MBC)","model-free adaptive control (MFAC)","nonlinear discrete-time systems","overview"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Dynamic-Linearization-Based Data-Driven Control and Applications","volume":"64","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7775006/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16808765","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374102, 61120106009, 61433002, 61333012 and 61627901"},{"fundingName":"Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Dynamic-Linearization-Based Data-Driven Control and Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-chi-2636126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203223S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7895231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"7895231","articleId":"7775006","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7775008,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Zhang","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7927801/7775008/zhang-2628703-small.gif","p":["Zheng Zhang (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2015.","His industrial experiences include Coventor Inc.

Stochastic spectral methods are a promising technique to quantify the uncertainties caused by process variations. Despite their superior efficiency over Monte Carlo for many design cases, stochastic spectral methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., their computational cost grows very fast as the number of random parameters increases. In order to solve this challenging problem, this paper presents a high-dimensional uncertainty quantification algorithm from a big data perspective. Specifically, we show that the huge number of (e.g., 1.5 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">27</sup>\n) simulation samples in standard stochastic collocation can be reduced to a very small one (e.g., 500) by exploiting some hidden structures of a high-dimensional data array. This idea is formulated as a tensor recovery problem with sparse and low-rank constraints, and it is solved with an alternating minimization approach. The numerical results show that our approach can efficiently simulate some IC, MEMS, and photonic problems with over 50 independent random parameters, whereas the traditional algorithm can only deal with a small number of random parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2628703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7927801/07775008.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2628703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7927801","startPage":"687","endPage":"697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Big-Data Tensor Recovery for High-Dimensional Uncertainty Quantification of Process Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775008","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5503870/7927801/7775008-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Big-Data Tensor Recovery for High-Dimensional Uncertainty Quantification of Process Variations","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16885056","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775008/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF NEEDS Program"},{"fundingName":"AIM Photonics Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Big-Data Tensor Recovery for High-Dimensional Uncertainty Quantification of Process Variations","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-zhang-2628703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084678S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7927801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7927801","articleId":"7775008","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7775010,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7921657/7775010/ebrah-2636141-small.gif","p":["Zahra Ebrahimi received the BSc degree in computer engineering from\n Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, Iran, in 2014.

An efficient solution to cope with this obstacle is power gating inactive fractions of a single die, resulting in Dark Silicon. Previous studies employing power gating on SRAM-based FPGAs have primarily focused on using large-input Look-up Tables (LUTs). The architectures proposed in such studies inherently suffer from poor logic utilization which limits the benefits of power gating techniques. This paper proposes a Power-Efficient Architecture for FPGAs (PEAF) based on combination of Reconfigurable Hard Logics (RHLs) and a small-input LUT. In the proposed architecture, we selectively turn off unused RHLs and/or LUTs within each logic block by employing a reconfigurable controller. By mapping a majority of logic functions to simple-design RHLs, PEAF is able to significantly improve power efficiency without deteriorating the performance. Experimental results over a comprehensive set of benchmarks (MCNC, IWLS'05, and VTR) demonstrate that compared with baseline four-LUT architecture, PEAF reduces the total static power and Power-Delay-Product (PDP), on average, by 24.5 and 21.7 percent, respectively. This is while the overall system performance is also improved by 1.8 percent. PEAF increases total area by 18.9 percent, however, it still occupies 22.1 percent less area footprint than the six-LUT architecture with 31.5 percent improvement in PDP.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2016.2636141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7921657/07775010.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2636141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PEAF: A Power-Efficient Architecture for SRAM-Based FPGAs Using Reconfigurable Hard Logic Design in Dark Silicon Era","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"PEAF: A Power-Efficient Architecture for SRAM-Based FPGAs Using Reconfigurable Hard Logic Design in Dark Silicon Era","volume":"66","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16880671","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775010/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775010/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PEAF: A Power-Efficient Architecture for SRAM-Based FPGAs Using Reconfigurable Hard Logic Design in Dark Silicon Era","sourcePdf":"tc-asadi-2636141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103704S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7921657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7921657","articleId":"7775010","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-26"},{"_id":7775012,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Recently, we have shown self-heating to explain nonlinearity in dc IV characteristics. In this paper, we present the observation of self-heating using transient current during pulses. We show that the cooling timescale is limited by measurement system timescale (~30 ns). The self-heating-based experimental current transient timescale is longer (50-100 ns) and is not described by simple exponential decay. To explain this behavior, self-heating in PCMO RRAM (where Joule heating and current increase create a positive feedback) is implemented into technology computer aided design simulations. Simulations produce excellent agreement with experiments. Eventually, simulations deviate from experiments when thermally assisted ionic transport during set/reset is not included in the model. To interrupt the continuous self-heating, an n-pulse-train with cooling time between pulses versus single pulse-based set/reset experiment was designed with the same peak bias time. Set/reset effectiveness degrades as n increases while effect of increasing cooling time confirmed a cooling timescale of ~30 ns.

In this paper, the battery energy storage (BES) systems are used in order to solve the voltage rise during the peak PV generation as well as the voltage drop while meeting the peak load. A coordinated control strategy is proposed to regulate the charge/discharge of BESs using a combination of the local droop-based control method and a distributed control scheme which ensures the voltages of feeder remain within allowed limits. Therefore, two different consensus algorithms are used: the first algorithm determines the BESs participation in voltage regulation in terms of their installed capacity whereas the second one modifies the BESs performance in terms of their state of charge to prevent the excessive saturation or depletion of batteries. The proposed controller enables the effective use of storage capacity in different conditions. Finally, the simulation results based upon real data of a radial distribution feeder validate the effectiveness of this approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07775016.pdf","startPage":"3582","endPage":"3593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2636217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2636217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Control of Battery Energy Storage Systems for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks With High PV Penetration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Batteries","Decentralized control","Heuristic algorithms","Reactive power","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery storage plants","distributed control","distributed power generation","distribution networks","energy storage","photovoltaic power systems","power distribution control","power generation control","power grids","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery energy storage systems","voltage regulation","high PV penetration","voltage rise problem","low voltage distribution networks","photovoltaic resources","renewable resources","maximum PV penetration","security issues","peak PV generation","voltage drop","peak load","coordinated control strategy","local droop-based control method","distributed control scheme","storage capacity","consensus algorithms","BES","radial distribution feeder","reliability issues"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BES","consensus algorithm","coordinated control","LV distribution network","PV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Control of Battery Energy Storage Systems for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks With High PV Penetration","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7775016/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857423","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Control of Battery Energy Storage Systems for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks With High PV Penetration","sourcePdf":"tsg-hamedanigolshan-2636217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116522S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7775016","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7775023,"authors":[{"name":"Blaise Ravelo","affiliation":["IRSEEM EA, Rouen, France"],"firstName":"Blaise","lastName":"Ravelo","orcid":"0000-0001-7334-5016","id":"37586397000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7775023","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775023","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Impedance","Cutoff frequency","Topology","Transfer functions","Network topology","Frequency synthesizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","linear network synthesis","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-pass negative group delay RC-network impedance","high-pass NGD canonical transfer function","circuit impedance equivalent principle","first-order circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit theory","high-pass function","linear network impedance","negative group delay (NGD)"]}],"abstract":"This brief describes a synthesis of high-pass negative group delay (NGD) network impedance.

Security checkpoints have been placed at the entrances to many public places to detect prohibited items, such as handguns and explosives. Generally, human operators are in charge of these tasks as automated recognition in baggage inspection is still far from perfect. Research and development on X-ray testing is, however, exploring new approaches based on computer vision that can be used to aid human operators. This paper attempts to make a contribution to the field of object recognition in X-ray testing by evaluating different computer vision strategies that have been proposed in the last years. We tested ten approaches. They are based on bag of words, sparse representations, deep learning, and classic pattern recognition schemes among others. For each method, we: 1) present a brief explanation; 2) show experimental results on the same database; and 3) provide concluding remarks discussing pros and cons of each method. In order to make fair comparisons, we define a common experimental protocol based on training, validation, and testing data (selected from the public GDXray database). The effectiveness of each method was tested in the recognition of three different threat objects: 1) handguns; 2) shuriken (ninja stars); and 3) razor blades. In our experiments, the highest recognition rate was achieved by methods based on visual vocabularies and deep features with more than 95% of accuracy. We strongly believe that it is possible to design an automated aid for the human inspection task using these computer vision algorithms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7886382/07775025.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modern Computer Vision Techniques for X-Ray Testing in Baggage Inspection","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2628381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7886382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2628381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Modern Computer Vision Techniques for X-Ray Testing in Baggage Inspection","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16773890","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7775025/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fondecyt from CONICYT, Chile","grantNumber":"1161314 and 11150945"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modern Computer Vision Techniques for X-Ray Testing in Baggage Inspection","sourcePdf":"tsmc-mery-2628381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121882S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7886382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7886382","articleId":"7775025","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7775031,"authors":[{"name":"Michael G.

This approach reduces the computation burden and is convenient to be programed in microcontroller unit, which is suitable for EV real-time application. The steps of the approach are as follows: 1) decomposition of the current and voltage signals based on WTM; 2) denoising of the wavelet coefficients under the thresholding rule; and 3) reconstruction of the denoised current and voltage signals based on inverse WTM. A battery-management system prototype was built to verify the approach on a Li(NiCoMn)O\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n battery module with nominal capacity of 200 Ah and rated voltage of 3.6 V.

Applying direct current control to multilevel inverters combines the advantages of both and is an enabling step towards improved inverter performance. Direct current controllers suffer from high complexity at increased level count, which is resolved by using geometrical principles and simple analytical calculations for switching vector selection within the space vector diagram. The simplified, novel parametric controller concept is scalable to inverters with arbitrary level count, which does not require any switching tables and the new fully symmetric setup guarantees equal switching frequencies among the three phases. The hypotheses are further confirmed on a real hardware test setup on the example of a three-level NPC inverter hardware and a Xilinx development platform. Experimental results prove the expected behavior of the direct current control under various conditions, which shows a general approach to balance the dc-link capacitors of diode-clamped inverters within the theoretical limits and demonstrates the benefits of using field programmable gate arrays as a controller platform.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2636127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2636127","startPage":"3067","endPage":"3074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7874245/07775058.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Current Control for Grid-Connected Diode-Clamped Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Direct Current Control for Grid-Connected Diode-Clamped Inverters","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7775058/","accessionNumber":"16723151","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775058/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Current Control for Grid-Connected Diode-Clamped Inverters","sourcePdf":"tie-schaefer-2636127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081661S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7874245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7874245","articleId":"7775058","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7775059,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Am\u00e1vel Pinheiro","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8055017/7775059/pinhe-2636200-small.gif","p":["Miguel Am\u00e1vel Pinheiro received the MSc degree in electrical\n and computers engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, in 2010.

Such graphs consist of vertices in space connected by curves and can represent many real world structures such as road networks in remote sensing, or vessel networks in medical imaging. Graph matching can be used for very fast and possibly multimodal registration of images of these structures. We formulate the matching problem as a single player game solved using Monte Carlo Tree Search, which automatically balances exploring new possible matches and extending existing matches. Our method can handle partial matches, topological differences, geometrical distortion, does not use appearance information and does not require an initial alignment. Moreover, our method is very efficient-it can match graphs with thousands of nodes, which is an order of magnitude better than the best competing method, and the matching only takes a few seconds.","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8055017/07775059.pdf","startPage":"2171","endPage":"2185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8055017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2636200","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2636200","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Monte Carlo methods","Image edge detection","Three-dimensional displays","Biomedical imaging","Games","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","computer games","graph theory","image matching","image registration","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometrical distortion","competing method","geometric graph matching","Monte Carlo Tree Search","efficient matching method","generalized geometric graphs","road networks","remote sensing","vessel networks","medical imaging","matching problem","single player game"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Geometric graph matching","Monte Carlo tree search","image registration","curve descriptor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Geometric Graph Matching Using Monte Carlo Tree Search","accessionNumber":"17256342","pubMedId":"28114003","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2017","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775059/","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001824","fundingName":"Czech Science Foundation","grantNumber":"14-21421S and SFRH/BD/77134/2011"},{"fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric Graph Matching Using Monte Carlo Tree Search","sourcePdf":"tpami-pinheiro-2636200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12514S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8055017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8055017","articleId":"7775059","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7775061,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7847463/7775061/choi-2636162-small.gif","p":["Jinho Choi (SM\u201902) was born in Seoul, South Korea.

This multiple access scheme is suitable for the case that an access point (AP) needs not only to receive data symbols, but also to identify active devices when there are a number of devices with unique identification sequences (the number of devices can be easily more than a million) with low signaling/control overhead. We propose a two-stage transmission scheme for random access and derive computationally efficient methods to estimate the channel state information (CSI) of active devices over frequency-selective fading channels in the first stage and to perform joint active device identification and data detection in the second stage using a well-known sparse signal estimation method in compressive sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully estimate the CSI of active devices under reasonable conditions and identify the unique identification sequences or vectors of active devices with a high probability. For example, when 6 out of 64 devices become active, the AP can identify all six devices (using estimated CSI) with a probability higher than 1 - 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n over frequency-selective fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2016.2636162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2016.2636162","startPage":"162","endPage":"171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7847463/07775061.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Multiple Access for Many Devices of Unique Identifications Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Multiple Access for Many Devices of Unique Identifications Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16690233","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea Electric Power Corporation through the Korea Electrical Engineering and Science Research Institute","grantNumber":"R15XA03-60"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Multiple Access for Many Devices of Unique Identifications Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"jiot-choi-2636162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159486S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7847463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7847463","articleId":"7775061","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7775065,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Max Gil Innocencio Reis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil","Forensic Examination Service of Electronic and Multimedia Evidences, National Institute of Criminalistics, Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7831515/7775065/reis-2636095-small.gif","p":["Paulo Max Gil Innocencio Reis received the Diploma degree in telecommunications engineering from the Military Institute of Engineering, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998, the M.B.A degree in telecommunications business from the Federal Center of Technological Education, Rio de Janeiro, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in electric engineering from the University of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil, in 2016.","From 1999 to 2006, he was a Telecommunications Engineer Officer with Brazilian Army, where he was responsible for technical specifications, reports, and studies aimed at communications infrastructure of the Brazilian Army nationwide, and acting as a Communication Coordinator in several nationals and internationals travels of the Brazilian President.

These abnormal variations are caused by abrupt phase discontinuities due to insertions and suppressions of audio snippets during the tampering task. First, we propose an ESPRIT-Hilbert ENF estimator in conjunction with an outlier detector based on the sample kurtosis of the estimated ENF. Next, we use the computed kurtosis as an input for a support vector machine classifier to indicate the presence of tampering.

Current automatic signature-based biometric systems typically require five, ten, or even more specimens of a person's signature to learn intrapersonal variability sufficient to provide an accurate verification of the individual's identity. To mitigate this drawback, this paper proposes a procedure for training with only a single reference signature. Our strategy consists of duplicating the given signature a number of times and training an automatic signature verifier with each of the resulting signatures. The duplication scheme is based on a sigma lognormal decomposition of the reference signature. Two methods are presented to create human-like duplicated signatures: the first varies the strokes' lognormal parameters (stroke-wise) whereas the second modifies their virtual target points (target-wise). A challenging benchmark, assessed with multiple state-of-the-art automatic signature verifiers and multiple databases, proves the robustness of the system. Experimental results suggest that our system, with a single reference signature, is capable of achieving a similar performance to standard verifiers trained with up to five signature specimens.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8207702/07775072.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Signature Verification System Based on One Real Signature","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2016.2630419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2016.2630419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Signature Verification System Based on One Real Signature","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17447045","pubMedId":"28114052","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7775072/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government\u2019s MCINN","grantNumber":"TEC2016-77791-C4-1-R"},{"fundingName":"European Union FEDER Program/Funds"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Fellowship from the ULPGC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation Fellowship","grantNumber":"P300P2-151279"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC CANADA","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2015-06409"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Signature Verification System Based on One Real Signature","sourcePdf":"tcyb-diaz-2630419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119443S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8207702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8207702","articleId":"7775072","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7775075,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Sung An","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7811156/7775075/an-2636137-small.gif","p":["Jae-Sung An (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in media communications engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

To verify the proposed ACS method, a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) was fabricated using a 0.35-$\\mu \\text{m}$ CMOS process technology with 18 V high-voltage devices and was measured using a 46-in capacitive touch sensor (CTS). When no external noises are induced into the CTS, the measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ROIC is 45.8 dB at a reporting rate of 120 Hz. When external noises are induced into the CTS, the measured SNR of the ROIC using the ACS method is 44.5 dB, which is improved by 22.0 dB compared with the SNR achieved without using the ACS method. Therefore, the proposed ACS method effectively eliminates external noises induced into the CTS of the CTSS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Highly Noise-Immune Capacitive Touch Sensing System Using an Adaptive Chopper Stabilization Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2016.2636137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7811156/07775075.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2636137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Highly Noise-Immune Capacitive Touch Sensing System Using an Adaptive Chopper Stabilization Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7775075/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16614811","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Highly Noise-Immune Capacitive Touch Sensing System Using an Adaptive Chopper Stabilization Method","sourcePdf":"jsen-kwon-2636137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064118S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7811156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7811156","articleId":"7775075","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7775077,"authors":[{"name":"Shaodi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shaodi Wang (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree from the Division of Microelectronic, Electronics Engineering and Computer Science Department, Peking University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the NanoCAD Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering."]},"firstName":"Shaodi","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-0863-6033","id":"37070502300"},{"name":"Andrew Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Andrew Pan (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received his B.S. degree in physics and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he is currently a lecturer and project scientist.

This paper proposes a new framework to efficiently and accurately match periocular images that are automatically acquired under less-constrained environments. Our framework, referred to as semantics-assisted convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) in this paper, incorporates explicit semantic information to automatically recover comprehensive periocular features. This strategy enables superior matching accuracy with the usage of relatively smaller number of training samples, which is often an issue with several biometrics. Our reproducible experimental results on four different publicly available databases suggest that the SCNN-based periocular recognition approach can achieve outperforming results, both in achievable accuracy and matching time, for less-constrained periocular matching. Additional experimental results presented in this paper also indicate that the effectiveness of proposed SCNN architecture is not only limited to periocular recognition but it can also be useful for generalized image classification. Without increasing the volume of training data, the SCNN is able to automatically extract more discriminative features from the input data than a single CNN, therefore can consistently improve the recognition performance. The experimental results presented in this paper validate such an approach to enable faster and more accurate periocular recognition under less constrained environments.","publicationTitle":"IEEE

Segmentation","abstract":"Recently, significant improvement has been made on semantic object segmentation due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Training such a DCNN usually relies on a large number of images with pixel-level segmentation masks, and annotating these images is very costly in terms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple images (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean background). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing bottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no supervision information is needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with supervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the Initial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level segmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with cluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and image-level annotations, are utilized as the supervision information to learn the Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes 40K simple images from Flickr.com and 10K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely boosting the segmentation network. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STC framework compared with other state-of-the-arts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2017","volume":"39","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2017","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17256343","pubMedId":"28114002","htmlLink":"/document/7775087/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"STC: A Simple to Complex Framework for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800404"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61532005, 61210006, 61402268 and 61572264"},{"fundingName":"CAST young talents plan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STC: A Simple to Complex Framework for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tpami-wei-2636150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119004S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8055017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"8055017","articleId":"7775087","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7775090,"authors":[{"name":"Usman Ashraf","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking, King Faisal University, Hofuf, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Usman","lastName":"Ashraf","orcid":"0000-0001-6288-3513","id":"37640881300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7775090","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Greedy algorithms","Linear programming","Control systems","Minimization","Numerical models","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","integer programming","linear programming","software defined networking","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule minimization","traffic evolution","software-defined networks","flow optimization models","traffic rerouting","minimum rule application","mixed integer linear programming-based model","flow distribution","heuristic-based greedy algorithm","rule-aggregation optimization","multiobjective optimization model","rule installation","link utilization","PARETO","MIRA-RA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software-defined networking","rule minimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775090","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7894297/07775090.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2636212","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2636212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rule Minimization for Traffic Evolution in Software-Defined Networks","abstract":"This letter addresses the problem of traffic evolution in software defined networks (SDNs). SDNs achieve optimal flow distribution by using flow optimization models, but as traffic evolves, the underlying optimization model changes. Applying the online model frequently can result in a flood of control messages to switches for deleting, modifying, or installing new rules, and the resulting traffic re-routing can cause transient loops and synchronization issues. In this letter, we present minimum rule application (MIRA), a mixed integer linear programming-based model, which re-calculates flow distribution dynamically while minimizing the number of rule installations. Since the proposed model is NP-hard, we also propose an efficient heuristic-based greedy algorithm. In addition, we also propose a rule-aggregation (RA) optimization for minimizing rule installation (MIRA-RA). Finally, we propose a multi-objective optimization model, which jointly minimizes the conflicting objectives of rule installation and link utilization (PARETO) and use the \u03f5-constraint method to achieve pareto-optimality.

Currently, vehicles deploy expensive gyroscopes for attitude determination. A low-cost MEMS gyro cannot be used because of the drift problem. Typically, an accelerometer is used to correct this drift by measuring the attitude from gravitational acceleration. This is, however, not possible in vehicular applications, because accelerometer measurements are corrupted by external accelerations produced due to vehicle movements. In this paper, we show that vehicle kinematics allow the removal of external accelerations from the lateral and vertical axis accelerometer measurements, thus giving the correct estimate of lateral and vertical axis gravitational accelerations. An estimate of the longitudinal axis gravitational acceleration can then be obtained by using the vector norm property of gravitational acceleration. A Kalman filter is designed, which implements the proposed solution and uses the accelerometer in conjunction with the gyroscope to accurately determine the attitude of a vehicle. Hence, this paper enables the use of extremely low-cost MEMS IMU for accurate attitude determination in vehicular domain for the first time. The proposed filter was tested by both simulations and experiments under various dynamic conditions and results were compared with five existing methods from the literature. The proposed filter was able to maintain sub-degree estimation accuracy even under very severe and prolonged dynamic conditions. To signify the importance of the achieved accuracy in determining accurate attitude, we investigated its use in two vehicular applications: vehicle yaw estimate and vehicle location estimate by dead reckoning and showed the performance improvements obtained by the proposed filter.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2016.2627536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7956367/07775094.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2016.2627536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956367","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Attitude Estimation of a Moving Land Vehicle Using Low-Cost MEMS IMU Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Attitude Estimation of a Moving Land Vehicle Using Low-Cost MEMS IMU Sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16965583","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775094/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Attitude Estimation of a Moving Land Vehicle Using Low-Cost MEMS IMU Sensors","sourcePdf":"tits-tahir-2627536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092593S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7956367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7956367","articleId":"7775094","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7775095,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed El Shafie","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7775095/elsha-2636201-small.gif","p":["Ahmed El Shafie received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2009, with accumulative grade of distinction, and the M.Sc. degree in communication and information technology from Nile University, in 2014.

The users' assignment probabilities to the time slots are optimized to satisfy a certain quality-of-service (QoS) requirement for each of the legitimate source nodes. To further improve the system security, we propose beamforming-based cooperative jamming schemes subject to the availability of the channel state information (CSI) at the legitimate nodes. We assume that if a source node is not selected for data transmission, it is a cooperative jamming node. We impose an average transmit power constraint (averaged across time slots) on each source node. Hence, the source nodes should efficiently distribute their average transmit powers throughout the network operation between data and artificial noise transmissions to satisfy the QoS requirements. We investigate the two cases where a global CSI is assumed at the legitimate nodes and where there is no eavesdropper's CSI. The case where there is no CSI at the jamming nodes is also investigated and a new scheme is proposed. We derive closed-form expressions for the instantaneous secrecy rate for each scheme as well as the secrecy outage probability. Moreover, we derive the secrecy stable-throughput and delay-requirement regions of the network. Our proposed jamming schemes achieve significant increases in the secure throughput over existing schemes from the literature and over the no-jamming scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2636201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1065","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07775095.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Enhanced-Security for TDMA Transmissions from Buffered Source Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7775095/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Enhanced-Security for TDMA Transmissions from Buffered Source Nodes","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668643","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"NPRP from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 8-627-2-260"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415/14/22"},{"fundingName":"Newton Institutional Link","grantNumber":"172719890"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society Research Grant","grantNumber":"RG160302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Enhanced-Security for TDMA Transmissions from Buffered Source Nodes","sourcePdf":"twc-elshafie-2636201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095204S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7775095","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7775096,"authors":[{"name":"Huici Wu","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Wireless Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7775096/wu-2636288-small.gif","p":["Huici Wu (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree from Information Engineering School, Communication University of China, Beijing, China, in 2013.

The multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits information signals along with artificial noise (AN) to disturb the eavesdropper. Moreover, the friendly jammers are properly selected to assist the legitimate link for better secure transmission with some payoffs. With this system model, we first formulate a Stackelberg game between the BS and the assisting jammers with full channel state information. Stackelberg equilibriums, including optimal fraction of transmit power for AN, optimal transmit power, and asking prices of assisting jammers, are first proved to exist and then analytically derived. A policy iterative algorithm is also proposed to obtain the optimal solutions. We then extend the Stackelberg game to the case of MISOME broadcast wiretap channel with channel distribution information of eavesdropper. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived results and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The results reveal that the proposed jammer-assisted secure transmission can greatly improve the secrecy performance and meanwhile save more energy for information signals, which is significant for future wireless communication.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636288","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07775096.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Transmission in MISOME Wiretap Channel With Multiple Assisting Jammers: Maximum Secrecy Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775096","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7855844/7775096-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Secure Transmission in MISOME Wiretap Channel With Multiple Assisting Jammers: Maximum Secrecy Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775096/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669121","htmlLink":"/document/7775096/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A708"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501057"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325006"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B16006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CPS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-1405121 and NSFC61428101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secure Transmission in MISOME Wiretap Channel With Multiple Assisting Jammers: Maximum Secrecy Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wu-2636288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133018S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7775096","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7775113,"authors":[{"name":"Chung Kit Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7815447/7775113/ho-2636129-small.gif","p":["Chung Kit Ho graduated from the Medical Engineering Program at the University of Hong Kong with the B.Eng.

Here, we present a new framework to fabricate ultrasound-compatible flow phantoms to replicate human vasculature that is tortuous, nonplanar, and branching in nature. This framework is based upon the integration of rapid prototyping and investment casting principles. A pedagogical walkthrough of our engineering protocol is presented in this paper using a patient-specific cerebral aneurysm model as an exemplar demonstration. The procedure for constructing the flow circuit component of the phantoms is also presented, including the design of a programmable flow pump system, the fabrication of blood mimicking fluid, and flow rate calibration. Using polyvinyl alcohol cryogel as the tissue mimicking material, phantoms developed with the presented protocol exhibited physiologically relevant acoustic properties [attenuation coefficient: 0.229\u00b10.032 dB/(cm\u00b7MHz) and acoustic speed: 1535\u00b12.4 m/s], and their pulsatile flow dynamics closely resembled the flow profile input. As a first application of our developed phantoms, the flow pattern of the patient-specific aneurysm model was visualized by performing high-frame-rate color-encoded speckle imaging over multiple time-synchronized scan planes. Persistent recirculation was observed, and the vortex center was found to shift in position over a cardiac cycle, indicating the 3-D nature of flow recirculation inside an aneurysm. These findings suggest that phantoms produced from our reported protocol can serve well as acoustically compatible test beds for vascular ultrasound studies, including 3-D flow imaging.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2636129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7815447/07775113.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"38","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2636129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wall-Less Flow Phantoms With Tortuous Vascular Geometries: Design Principles and a Patient-Specific Model Fabrication Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Wall-Less Flow Phantoms With Tortuous Vascular Geometries: Design Principles and a Patient-Specific Model Fabrication Example","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7775113/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16585005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","pubMedId":"27959808","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2016-04042"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001805","fundingName":"Canada Foundation for Innovation","grantNumber":"36138"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund","grantNumber":"ITS/150/15"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"GRF 785113M"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wall-Less Flow Phantoms With Tortuous Vascular Geometries: Design Principles and a Patient-Specific Model Fabrication Example","sourcePdf":"tuffc-yu-2636129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147199S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7815447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7815447","articleId":"7775113","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7775114,"authors":[{"name":"Sabrina M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7775114/mulle-2636139-small.gif","p":["Sabrina M\u00fcller (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees in mathematics from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

Placing the optimal content into local caches is crucial due to storage limitations, but it requires knowledge about the content popularity distribution, which is often not available in advance. Moreover, local content popularity is subject to fluctuations, since mobile users with different interests connect to the caching entity over time. Which content a user prefers may depend on the user's context. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for context-aware proactive caching. The algorithm learns context-specific content popularity online by regularly observing context information of connected users, updating the cache content and observing cache hits subsequently. We derive a sublinear regret bound, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that our algorithm converges to the optimal cache content placement strategy in terms of maximizing the number of cache hits. Furthermore, our algorithm supports service differentiation by allowing operators of caching entities to prioritize customer groups. Our numerical results confirm that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in a real world data set, with an increase in the number of cache hits of at least 14%.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7849239/7775114-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16668630","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775114/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Context-Aware Proactive Content Caching With Service Differentiation in Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of Projects B3 and C1 within the Collaborative Research Center 1053\u2013MAKI"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF1524417 and ECCS1407712"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Context-Aware Proactive Content Caching With Service Differentiation in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-muller-2636139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140567S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7775114","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7775116,"authors":[{"name":"Zubair Md.

As a result, the number of potentially \u201cuntrusted\u201d connections to the mobile operator's core network is expected to dramatically increase. Therefore, the operators must provide adequate security, without significantly affecting the quality of service (QoS). Hence, joint consideration of QoS and security is a critical research issue. However, due to their difficult-to-model conflicting objectives, existing research works have often dealt with them separately. In this paper, we address this problem, formally formulate it, and envision GT-QoSec, a game-theoretic joint optimization of QoS and security. Using GT-QoSec, the mobile user equipment (UE) and their servicing base stations (eNBs) play games with each other. Thus, the UE obtains a balanced set of QoS and security levels while the eNBs maximize their bandwidth utilization. Extensive analysis and simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of GT-QoSec in contrast with several conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2636186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07775116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2636186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GT-QoSec: A Game-Theoretic Joint Optimization of QoS and Security for Differentiated Services in Next Generation Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GT-QoSec: A Game-Theoretic Joint Optimization of QoS and Security for Differentiated Services in Next Generation Heterogeneous Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668624","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7775116/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"16H05858"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005046","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province in China","grantNumber":"F2016035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GT-QoSec: A Game-Theoretic Joint Optimization of QoS and Security for Differentiated Services in Next Generation Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-fadlullah-2636186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082387S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7775116","onlineDate":"06 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7775169,"authors":[{"name":"A.

At ELF the vertical electric dipole (VED) antenna radiated at least 100,000 times more power than would a horizontal electric dipole having the same moment. That efficiency was achieved with an altitude of 12,500 feet (3810 m). Calculations show that the radiated power will increase as the fourth power of aerostat altitude. The tether antenna exhibited a corona onset voltage of 180 kV and was resistant to the degrading effects of ELF corona. Prolonged in-corona operation is therefore possible. The antenna was continuously tuned, despite changes in height and capacitance caused by the aerostat flight dynamics. The huge 300-H ELF tuning inductor posed no problem. Enhanced VED moments were achieved at ELF by operation at voltages up to 260 kV, 40% above the corona onset voltage. At VLF the antenna emulated a monopole that had a radiation efficiency greater than 90%. The measured bandwidths were large: 1.5 kHz at 23 kHz and 3.5 kHz at 34 kHz. The antenna height exceeded one-quarter wavelength at VLF, so the antenna could be tuned capacitively and required relatively low base voltages. At both VLF and ELF the measured fields agreed closely with predictions.","doi":"10.1029/RS024i002p00235","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7768804/07775329.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7768804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS024i002p00235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An aerostat-supported ELF/VLF transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1989","displayDocTitle":"An aerostat-supported ELF/VLF transmitter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775329/","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"02","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An aerostat-supported ELF/VLF transmitter","sourcePdf":"rds2953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044237S","chronDate":"March-April  1989","isNumber":"7768804","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7775329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7775408,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This representation is very efficient for a numerical evaluation of the field when the source and observation points are laterally rather than vertically separated with respect to the plane of the substrate. Furthermore, when the integration contour is deformed to the steepest descent path, the Green's function exhibits an even faster convergence. In contrast, the conventional Sommerfeld integral representation of the microstrip Green's function converges very poorly for this case. Numerical examples are presented which indicate that the representations obtained here are surprisingly efficient even for relatively small lateral separation of the source and field points.

A further step in this direction has been the development of the imaging riometer for ionospheric studies (IRIS). This instrument provides a two-dimensional image of regions of enhanced cosmic noise absorption at 38.2 MHz with a spatial resolution as small as 20 km and time resolution of 1 s. The IRIS antenna is a 64-element dipole array, phased to produce 49 independent beams viewing an ionospheric area about 200 km square at 90 km altitude. One IRIS instrument has been operating at the South Pole station since January, 1988; a second instrument was recently installed at Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland. This paper presents a technical description of the IRIS system. The response of the IRIS to a sun-aligned absorption arc is illustrated and compared with that of a broad-beam riometer. An intense, localized structure that developed within the arc was observed by IRIS to propagate in the magnetic poleward direction with a speed of 1 km/s.","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7769083/07775415.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1029/RS025i004p00325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS025i004p00325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7769083","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A phased-array radiowave imager for studies of cosmic noise absorption","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris","Butler matrices","Absorption","Structural beams","Antenna measurements","Receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1990","displayDocTitle":"A phased-array radiowave imager for studies of cosmic noise absorption","volume":"25","issue":"04","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A phased-array radiowave imager for studies of cosmic noise absorption","sourcePdf":"rds3032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041036S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1990","isNumber":"7769083","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7775415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7775620,"authors":[{"name":"James R.

The water level in the lake is influenced by various factors, among which the most important include: the water inflow, discharge of water and water seepage. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANN) are selected for the water level prediction because of their well-known abilities for learning from examples. A total of 29 years of water level measurement data was used for ANN training and validation. This paper represents a sequential approach for the short-term water level prediction in Jablanicko lake by using only water level data. With regard to sequential approach for every step of the prediction, the most recent data were used for ANN training. Two types of ANNs were used in this study: Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) neural networks and Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) neural networks. The main focus of this study was on NAR networks prediction of water level, while FFBP networks were used for comparison purposes. The results showed that neural networks can provide quality water level prediction even if only water level data is used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775713/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16522658","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7775713/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A sequential approach for short-term water level prediction using nonlinear autoregressive neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential approach for short-term water level prediction using nonlinear autoregressive neural networks","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077898S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761993","isNumber":"7775699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761993","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7775699","articleId":"7775713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7775716,"authors":[{"name":"Nermin Goran","affiliation":["BH Telecom JSC, Sarajevo"],"firstName":"Nermin","lastName":"Goran","id":"38493727800"},{"name":"Berina Be\u010diragi\u0107","affiliation":["BH Telecom JSC, Sarajevo"],"firstName":"Berina","lastName":"Be\u010diragi\u0107","id":"37086178416"},{"name":"Mesud Had\u017eiali\u0107","affiliation":["ETF Sarajevo, BIH, University of Sarajevo"],"firstName":"Mesud","lastName":"Had\u017eiali\u0107","id":"37605608200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2902-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2903-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7775716","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Degradation","Streaming media","IPTV","Correlation","Packet loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IPTV","quality of experience","quality of service","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network parameter degradation mapping","video QoE parameter","IPTV service","quality of service","Internet Protocol TeleVision video","transfer channel function","temporal analysis","MM service delivery","multimedia service delivery","flow control","analog-to-digital conversion","OSI reference model","open system interconnection reference model","QoE","quality of experience","video perception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quality of Service","Quality of Experience","IPTV","QoS/QoE correlation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775716","abstract":"This paper aims to consider how changes in QoS (Quality of Service) indicators affect the quality of IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) video.

When processing medical images, it is of particular relevance to improve the perceived quality of images, while preserving the diagnostically relevant information. This paper investigates the capacity of a neural network framework for medical image denoising. Specifically, the performance of the proposed image denoising method is evaluated on a database of computed tomography images of lungs using various image quality metrics, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and mean squared error. Image denoising relies on block segmentation of noisy and low-pass filtered images to generate the input and the target data for the neural network training. This paper investigates how the choice of block size, network architecture, and the training method affect the denoising performance when image is degraded with additive Gaussian noise. The paper proposes the use of Kohonen's self-organizing maps for segmentation of feature space and the use of multiple, finely tuned multi-layer perceptrons to achieve an improved denoising performance.","doi":"10.1109/BIHTEL.2016.7775733","publicationTitle":"2016 XI International Symposium on Telecommunications (BIHTEL)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIHTEL.2016.7775733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7775699","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761993/7775699/07775733.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XI International Symposium on Telecommunications (BIHTEL)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Artificial neural networks","Image denoising","Neurons","Training","Noise reduction","Computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","image denoising","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","lung","medical image processing","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network application","lung CT image denoising","digital image processing","medical image processing","image quality improvement","medical image denoising","computed tomography image","noisy image block segmentation","low-pass filtered image block segmentation","neural network training","additive Gaussian noise","Kohonen self-organizing map","feature space segmentation","multiple finely tuned multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal processing","Image Processing","Artificial Intelligence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to denoising of CT images of lungs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775733/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7775733/","accessionNumber":"16522656","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to denoising of CT images of lungs","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059993S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761993","isNumber":"7775699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761993","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7775699","articleId":"7775733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":7775734,"authors":[{"name":"Emir Turajli\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosna and Hercegovina"],"firstName":"Emir","lastName":"Turajli\u0107","id":"37284268000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2902-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2903-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7775734","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Artificial neural networks","Image reconstruction","Image segmentation","Training","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","data compression","image coding","image segmentation","medical image processing","multilayer perceptrons","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CT images compression","medical image compression","PSNR","MSE","image quality metrics","artificial neural networks","self-organizing maps","feature space segmentation","multilayer perceptrons","network architecture","block size","training method","compression performance","computed tomography lung images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal processing","Image Processing","Artificial Intelligence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIHTEL.2016.7775734","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761993/7775699/07775734.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 XI International Symposium on Telecommunications (BIHTEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XI International Symposium on Telecommunications (BIHTEL)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7775699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIHTEL.2016.7775734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to compression of CT images","abstract":"Efficient compression of medical images is needed to decrease the storage space and enable efficient image transfer over network for access of electronic patient records. Since the medical images contain diagnostically relevant information, it is necessary for the process of image compression to preserve high levels of image fidelity, especially when the images are compressed at low bit rates. This paper investigates the capacity of an artificial neural network framework for medical image compression. Specifically, the performance of the proposed image compression method is evaluated on a database of computed tomography images of lungs, where PSNR and MSE are used as the principal image quality metrics. The compressed image data is derived from the hidden layer outputs, where the artificial neural networks are trained to reconstruct the network input features. The results of image block segmentation are used as the network training features. The paper proposes the use of Kohonen's self-organizing maps for segmentation of feature space and the use of multiple finely tuned multi-layer perceptrons to achieve an improved compression performance. This paper presents a study on how the choice of block size, network architecture, and training method affect the compression performance. An attempt is made to optimize the artificial neural network framework for the compression of computed tomography lung images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775734/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16522642","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7775734/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to compression of CT images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to compression of CT images","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052853S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761993","isNumber":"7775699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761993","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7775699","articleId":"7775734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7775738,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To incorporate the temporal effects E-model is partially utilized as well. This way a universal tool capable of harnessing the information about the speech quality for stress testing and monitoring of the local infrastructure has been developed enabling the telephony infrastructure administrators to evaluate the performance and stability of the systems in their hands.

The localization estimate of a mobile station is obtained using the fingerprint technique. The fingerprint of a point is a vector whose terms are the field strengths of the signal received from a network of fixed base stations. The location algorithm is based on minimizing the Euclidean distance between the fingerprint of the unknown point and the fingerprints of a mesh of reference points. Traditionally the fingerprints (stored in a database) of the reference points are obtained by measurement. Here, we propose obtaining these data by using deterministic Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) models. The model considers multiple bounces and the transmission through indoor walls and also the scattering from furniture in order to obtain a reliable database for the problem. Using the GTD model, the localization system is simulated in two indoor scenarios with different parameters. The proposed procedure based on a GTD model appears well suited for the design and optimization of localization systems tailored to specific scenarios and avoids large and costly measurement campaigns. Several results and conclusions are presented that illustrate these points.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2007RS003788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771424","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771424/07775783.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of GTD for location systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of GTD for location systems","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"06","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of GTD for location systems","sourcePdf":"rds5538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022357S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","isNumber":"7771424","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7775783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7775853,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, to date, MIMO research has focused primarily on short-range communications within the VHF, UHF, and SHF bands, and very little research has been conducted toward exploiting MIMO techniques for long-range communications within the HF band. Between September 2007 and September 2008, several experimental campaigns were conducted to investigate the feasibility of applying MIMO techniques within the HF band.

By manipulating antenna geometry, the Pareto GA simultaneously optimizes the received Galactic background or \u201csky\u201d noise level and radiation patterns of the antenna over all frequencies. Geometrical constraints are handled explicitly in the GA in order to guarantee the realizability, and to impart control over the monetary cost of the generated designs. The antenna elements considered are broadband planar dipoles arranged horizontally over the ground. It is demonstrated that the Pareto GA approach generates a set of designs, which exhibit a wide range of trade-offs between the two design objectives, and satisfy all constraints. Multiple GA executions are performed to determine how antenna performance trade-offs are affected by different geometrical constraint values, feed impedance values, radiating element shapes and orientations, and ground conditions. Two different planar dipole antenna designs are constructed, and antenna input impedance and sky noise drift scan measurements are performed to validate the results of the GA.","doi":"10.1029/2008RS004131","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771192/07775938.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2008RS004131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of broadband antenna elements for a low-frequency radio telescope using Pareto genetic algorithm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of broadband antenna elements for a low-frequency radio telescope using Pareto genetic algorithm optimization","volume":"44","issue":"06","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of broadband antenna elements for a low-frequency radio telescope using Pareto genetic algorithm optimization","sourcePdf":"rds5682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023621S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"7771192","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7775938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7775954,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Key requirements include a frequency-independent beam direction over a 30 MHz band centered around 220 MHz, with correct reconstruction of pulse lengths down to 200 ns. The clock jitter from sample to sample must be extremely low for the integer sample delays. The FSD must also be able to delay the 30 MHz wide signal band by 1/1024th of a sample without introducing phase shifts, and it must operate entirely in baseband. An extensive simulation system based on mathematical models has been developed, with inclusion of performance-degrading aspects such as noise, timing error, and bandwidth. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters in the baseband of a band-pass-sampled signal have been used to apply true time delay beamforming. It has been confirmed that such use is both possible and well behaved. The target beam-pointing accuracy of 0.06\u00b0 is achievable using optimized FIR filters with lengths of 36 taps and an 18 bit coefficient resolution. Even though the minimum fractional delay step necessary for beamforming is \u223c13.1 ps, the maximum sampling timing error allowed in the array is found to be \u03c3 \u2264 120 ps if the errors are close to statistically independent.","doi":"10.1029/2008RS004124","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771222/07775954.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2008RS004124","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of post-ADC digital beamforming for large aperture array radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of post-ADC digital beamforming for large aperture array radars","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775954/","volume":"45","issue":"03","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of post-ADC digital beamforming for large aperture array radars","sourcePdf":"rds5681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036986S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"7771222","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7775954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7775992,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The properties of the recorded time domain slow tail vary with the causative lightning strike's current moment, the waveguide's characteristics, and the distance of propagation. These variations allow us to approximate the location of a causal lightning strike by examining the corresponding sferic. Many methods require measurements from multiple stations; however, the goal of this work is to approximate the distance a sferic propagated using measurements from a single station. J. R. Wait developed an analytical model that describes the propagation of the slow tail along a uniform path in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. We examine different source functions and apply them to Wait's propagation model in order to ascertain a new and more accurate method for modeling slow tails while improving the accuracy of locating lightning using a single station. Further, we expand the model to include sferics propagating in a nonuniform ionosphere, i.e., crossing the day-night terminator. This new method provides improved correlation of computed slow tails to recorded ones, leading to a more accurate distance approximation for a larger set of sferics.","doi":"10.1029/2010RS004405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2010RS004405","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771408/07775992.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightning location using the slow tails of sferics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Lightning location using the slow tails of sferics","volume":"45","issue":"05","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775992/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightning location using the slow tails of sferics","sourcePdf":"rds5771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044531S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","isNumber":"7771408","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7775992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7775999,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It presents a self-consistent physical-statistical approach for predicting fading phenomena usually occurring in land-satellite communication links caused by influence of the terrain features on radio signal propagation from the ground-based to the satellite antenna. This approach combines (1) the statistical description of the buildings array located on the rough terrain and the buildings\u2019 overlay profile, based on special probabilistic distributions of built-up terrain parameters, and (2) the theoretical description of propagation phenomena, taking into account multiple scattering, reflection, and diffraction mechanisms. A new technique is proposed for predicting the probability of fading phenomena occurring in land-satellite links using the so-called stochastic multi-parametric model. Results of theoretical predictions are compared with those obtained from the \u201cpure statistical\u201d Lutz model and physical-statistical Saunders-Evans model, and then with experimental data obtained for different European cities. Obtained results show that the proposed stochastic approach can be used as a good predictor of fading phenomena in land-satellite communication links for different satellite constellation scenarios and elevations of satellites during their movement surrounding the Earth, with respect to the ground-based antenna for different land environments: rural, mixed residential, suburban, and urban.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of fading phenomena in land-satellite communication links","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1029/2010RS004352","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771511/07775999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2010RS004352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7775999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7775999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of fading phenomena in land-satellite communication links","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"06","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of fading phenomena in land-satellite communication links","sourcePdf":"rds5754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050189S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","isNumber":"7771511","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7775999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776009,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The only existing system on the EVLA operating below 100 MHz is the \u201c4 m\u201d (74 MHz) system which uses crossed half-wave dipoles located in front of the Cassegrain subreflector as the feed. However, the dipole feeds of this system introduce blockage, and a reduction in system sensitivity (estimated to be \u223c6% at 1.4 GHz) is observed at higher frequency bands; hence the dipoles are removed most of the time. An alternative feed concept is therefore proposed in this paper. The proposed system appears to reduce sensitivity degradation at 1.4 GHz by 3% and thus might be permanently mounted. Moreover, the new system has sensitivity comparable to the existing system at frequencies below 100 MHz. The feed for this system consists of dipoles mounted between the adjacent struts of the reflector and is thus referred to as a strut-straddling feed array. This design and the analysis methodology used in this paper should be applicable in meeting the contiguous frequency coverage requirement (50\u2013470 MHz) of the new low frequency system proposed for the EVLA. Also, it may be applied in the modification of other existing large reflector antennas for low frequency operation.","doi":"10.1029/2011RS004710","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771190/07776118.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2011RS004710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of low frequency strut-straddling feed arrays for EVLA reflector antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of low frequency strut-straddling feed arrays for EVLA reflector antennas","volume":"46","issue":"03","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of low frequency strut-straddling feed arrays for EVLA reflector antennas","sourcePdf":"rds5899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022965S","chronDate":"June  2011","isNumber":"7771190","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7776118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7776119,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Ming Huang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan."],"firstName":"Sung-Ming","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Chang-Lien Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan."],"firstName":"Chang-Lien","lastName":"Hsu"},{"name":"Alfred B.

The phase shift causes the event time to move and hinders cross-comparing of events between different platforms. Notch-filtering also create fictitious dips in the current moment spectrum of the ELF sferics that lead to error in deducing the charge moment change (CMC) of the source discharge. To alleviate the effects of notch-filtering, we use an elementary signal processing method to reconstruct the source signals and use lab-generated ELF-like signals to check the limitations of the reconstruction. The results indicate that the delay of signals due to the notch-filtering module can be reliably restored, while the amplitude is less; but the reconstruction does restore the low frequency components of the sferics that are important for the CMC determination. Using the corrected event time, 20 associated sprites recorded by the ISUAL/FORMOSAT-2 experiment during June to September of 2008 were found. Comparing with the notch-filtered sferics, the reconstructed sferics are found to increase the current moment amplitude I\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</inf>\nds by 69 \u00b1 55%, reduce the time constant \u03c4 by 52 \u00b1 15%, and lowers the CMC by 22 \u00b1 21%, respectively.

On the one hand, since a larger number of microphones is available, a better noise reduction performance can be achieved for the binaural configuration compared to the bilateral configuration. On the other hand, the sensitivity to DOA estimation errors is increased. In this paper, we objectively evaluate the performance of a bilateral and a binaural MVDR beamformer, which is steered towards the direction of the desired speech source using a DOA estimator based on a discriminative classifier. Simulation results show that in general the binaural MVDR beamformer shows a better performance compared to the bilateral MVDR beamformer even for very low input SNRs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Speech Communication; 12.

Some classical approaches in this context estimate the azimuth source position based on the heuristic combination of binaural cues. In localization with a microphone array in free field, however, optimizing a cost function is often used to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA). In this paper we present two novel binaural localization algorithms based on optimizing cost functions derived from beamforming techniques. Our methods are able to localize and track multiple source positions in the frontal horizontal plane without prior training of the interaction between source positions and binaural cues. The methods also enable the localization across a wide range of frequencies in the presence of reverberation and head movement. Results over various source/receiver positions demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776137","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"Speech Communication; 12.

However, limited transmission capacity of such devices necessitates the data compression of signals transmitted from one hearing aid to the contralateral one. In this paper we study the impact of quantization as a data compression scheme on the performance of the multi-microphone noise reduction algorithms. Using the binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer as an illustration, we propose a quantization aware beamforming scheme which uses a modified cross power spectral density (CPSD) of the system noise including the quantization noise (QN). Moreover, several assumptions on the QN are investigated in the proposed method. Based on the output SNR, we compare different variations of the proposed method with the conventional BMVDR beamformer. The results confirm the improved performance of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776137","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"Speech Communication; 12.

The aim of this method is to classify an \u201cunknown\u201d target as one of the \u201cknown\u201d targets in an aspect-independent manner. The suggested method initially collects the late-time portion of noise-free time-scattered signals obtained from different reference aspect angles of known targets. Afterward, these signals are used to obtain MUSIC spectrums in real frequency domain having super-resolution ability and noise resistant feature. In the final step, PCA technique is applied to these spectrums in order to reduce dimensionality and obtain only one feature vector per known target. In the decision stage, noise-free or noisy scattered signal of an unknown (test) target from an unknown aspect angle is initially obtained. Subsequently, MUSIC algorithm is processed for this test signal and resulting test vector is compared with feature vectors of known targets one by one. Finally, the highest correlation gives the type of test target. The method is applied to wire models of airplane targets, and it is shown that it can tolerate considerable noise levels although it has a few different reference aspect angles. Besides, the runtime of the method for a test target is sufficiently low, which makes the method suitable for real-time applications.","doi":"10.1029/2011RS004662","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771591/07776223.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2011RS004662","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar target classification method with high accuracy and decision speed performance using MUSIC spectrum vectors and PCA projection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Radar target classification method with high accuracy and decision speed performance using MUSIC spectrum vectors and PCA projection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776223/","volume":"46","issue":"05","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar target classification method with high accuracy and decision speed performance using MUSIC spectrum vectors and PCA projection","sourcePdf":"rds5872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031171S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"7771591","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"8","articleId":"7776223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776240,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this work we present an approach based on RNNs, specifically designed for the clinical domain, that combines static and dynamic information in order to predict future events. We work with a database collected in the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin that contains complete information concerning patients that underwent a kidney transplantation. After the transplantation three main endpoints can occur: rejection of the kidney, loss of the kidney and death of the patient. Our goal is to predict, based on information recorded in the Electronic Health Record of each patient, whether any of those endpoints will occur within the next six or twelve months after each visit to the clinic. We compared different types of RNNs that we developed for this work, with a model based on a Feedforward Neural Network and a Logistic Regression model. We found that the RNN that we developed based on Gated Recurrent Units provides the best performance for this task. We also used the same models for a second task, i.e., next event prediction, and found that here the model based on a Feedforward Neural Network outperformed the other models. Our hypothesis is that long-term dependencies are not as relevant in this task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Clinical Events by Combining Static and Dynamic Information Using Recurrent Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2016.16","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774974/7776301/07776332.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2016.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Clinical Events by Combining Static and Dynamic Information Using Recurrent Neural Networks","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776332/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523717","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Clinical Events by Combining Static and Dynamic Information Using Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"6117a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06251S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774974","isNumber":"7776301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774974","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7776301","articleId":"7776332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776352,"authors":[{"name":"Asif Salekin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia"],"firstName":"Asif","lastName":"Salekin","id":"38561746300"},{"name":"John Stankovic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Stankovic","id":"37279446200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6117-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6118-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7776352","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":738},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kidney","Diseases","Diabetes","Mathematical model","Red blood cells","Potassium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","feature selection","learning (artificial intelligence)","mean square error methods","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","cost-accuracy tradeoff analysis","CKD","root mean square error","machine learning classifier","chronic kidney disease detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chronic kidney disease","machine learning","feature selection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease and Selecting Important Predictive Attributes","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2016.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776301","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774974/7776301/07776352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2016.36","startPage":"262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776352","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern with rising prevalence.

Using our approach we achieve a detection accuracy of 0.993 according to the F1-measure with 0.1084 root mean square error. This is a 56% reduction of mean square error compared to the state of the art (i.e., the CKD-EPI equation: a glomerular filtration rate estimator). We also perform feature selection to determine the most relevant attributes for detecting CKD and rank them according to their predictability. We identify new predictive attributes which have not been used by any previous GFR estimator equations. Finally, we perform a cost-accuracy tradeoff analysis to identify a new CKD detection approach with high accuracy and low cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16523698","htmlLink":"/document/7776352/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease and Selecting Important Predictive Attributes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease and Selecting Important Predictive Attributes","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"6117a262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.185338S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774974","isNumber":"7776301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774974","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7776301","articleId":"7776352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":7776398,"authors":[{"name":"Dino Nienhold","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland Institute for Information Systems, School of Business, Basel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dino","lastName":"Nienhold","id":"37085705108"},{"name":"Rolf Dornberger","affiliation":["Sch. of Bus., Univ. of Appl.

Collective I/O Performance Using Non-volatile Memory Devices","abstract":"Collective I/O is a parallel I/O technique designed to deliver high performance data access to scientific applications running on high-end computing clusters. In collective I/O, write performance is highly dependent upon the storage system response time and limited by the slowest writer. The storage system response time in conjunction with the need for global synchronisation, required during every round of data exchange and write, severely impacts collective I/O performance. Future Exascale systems will have an increasing number of processor cores, while the number of storage servers will remain relatively small. Therefore, the storage system concurrency level will further increase, worsening the global synchronisation problem. Nowadays high performance computing nodes also have access to locally attached solid state drives, effectively providing an additional tier in the storage hierarchy. Unfortunately, this tier is not always fully integrated. In this paper we propose a set of MPI-IO hints extensions that enable users to take advantage of fast, locally attached storage devices to boost collective I/O performance by increasing parallelism and reducing global synchronisation impact in the ROMIO implementation. We demonstrate that by using local storage resources, collective write performance can be greatly improved compared to the case in which only the global parallel file system is used, but can also decrease if the ratio between aggregators and compute nodes is too small.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776485/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776485/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16523633","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving Collective I/O Performance Using Non-volatile Memory Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Collective I/O Performance Using Non-volatile Memory Devices","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3653a120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061647S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774973","isNumber":"7776455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774973","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7776455","articleId":"7776485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776489,"authors":[{"name":"Jinliang Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinliang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086137994"},{"name":"Ao Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085650351"},{"name":"Shangguang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shangguang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599736600"},{"name":"Qibo Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qibo","lastName":"Sun","id":"37531906100"},{"name":"Jinglin Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinglin","lastName":"Li","id":"37676311700"},{"name":"Fangchun Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangchun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292382500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3653-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3654-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"7776489","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Reliability","Virtual machining","Predictive models","Computer crashes","Training","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic cloud environment","heterogenous cloud environment","cloud computing","cloud service reliability","virtual machines","collected data predictive power","machine learning","StaP","multiple machine status prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud environment","status prediction","heterogenous","dynamic"]}],"abstract":"The widespread utilization of cloud computing services has brought in the emergence of cloud service reliability as an important issue for both cloud providers and users.

While traditional erasure coding schemes, such as Reed-Solomon codes, suffer from high reconstruction cost and I/Os. The recent past has seen a plethora of efforts to optimize the tradeoff between the reconstruction cost, I/Os and storage overhead. Quietly different from all prior studies, in this paper, our erasure coding technology makes the first attempt to take advantage of the unequal failure rates across the disks/nodes to optimize the reconstruction performance and system reliability. Specifically, our proposed technology, the Unequal Failure Protection based Local Reconstruction Code (UFP-LRC) divides the data blocks into several unequal-sized groups with local parities, assigning the data blocks stored on more failure-prone disks/nodes into the smaller-sized group, so as to provide unequal failure protection for each group. In this way, by exploiting the nonuniform local parity degrees, the proposed UFP-LRC enables the data blocks that are stored on more failure-prone disks/nodes to tolerate a greater number of failures while suffer from less repair cost than others, leading to a substantial improvement of overall repair performance and reliability for cloud storage system. We perform numerical analysis and build a prototype storage system to verify our approach. The analytical results show that the UFPLRC technique gradually outperforms LRC along the increase of failure rate ratio. Also, extensive experiments show that, when compared to LRC, UFP-LRC is able to achieve a 10% to 13% improvement in throughput, and a 8% to 12% reduction in decoding latency, while retaining a comparable overall reliability.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2016.16","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774973/7776455/07776514.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2016.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal Failure Protection Coding Technology for Cloud Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Unequal Failure Protection Coding Technology for Cloud Storage Systems","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7776514/","accessionNumber":"16523643","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal Failure Protection Coding Technology for Cloud Storage Systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3653a231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098379S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774973","isNumber":"7776455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774973","xplore-issue":"7776455","articleId":"7776514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776569,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Mennes","affiliation":["University of Antwerp-iMinds"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Mennes","id":"37085994724"},{"name":"Bart Spinnewyn","affiliation":["University of Antwerp-iMinds"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Spinnewyn","id":"38581151200"},{"name":"Steven Latr\u00e9","affiliation":["University of Antwerp-iMinds"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Latr\u00e9","id":"37393298000"},{"name":"Juan Felipe Botero","affiliation":["Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Juan Felipe","lastName":"Botero","id":"37681977500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5093-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5094-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7776569","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Genetic algorithms","Bandwidth","Biological cells","Computational modeling","Memory management","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","genetic algorithms","integer programming","linear programming","probability","service-oriented architecture","software fault tolerance","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GRECO","distributed genetic algorithm","reliable application placement","hybrid clouds","network latency","cloud environments","availability-aware placement algorithm","CPU-aware placement algorithm","memory-aware placement algorithm","network-aware placement algorithm","service-oriented applications","biased-random-key chromosome","fault-tolerance distributed pool model","integer linear programming approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776569","abstract":"Hybrid clouds, consisting of multiple individual smaller clouds with heterogeneous capabilities, are becoming more and more popular through concepts such as inter-clouds, fog-and edge-computing. They provide fast computations without introducing large network latency. However, such cloud environments often contain unreliable nodes and links that are failure prone. Therefore, the deployment of applications requiring availability guarantees is a current research challenge. If such a placement algorithm is CPU-, memory-, network-and availability-aware, the applications can use the resources as optimal as possible with a small failure probability. The optimal deployment of applications in the network infrastructure is a NP-hard problem and, as a consequence, exact algorithms to solve it are not scalable. In this paper we propose GRECO, a distributed genetic algorithm to place service-oriented applications on a hybrid cloud, by defining a representation of an application placement in a biased-random-key chromosome and using a fault-tolerance distributed pool model. When compared with an existing Integer Linear Programming approach, simulations show that GRECO is scalable (speedup of a factor of 1000) and obtain near optimal performance results.","doi":"10.1109/CloudNet.2016.45","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774976/7776557/07776569.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","publicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudNet.2016.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRECO: A Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Reliable Application Placement in Hybrid Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"GRECO: A Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Reliable Application Placement in Hybrid Clouds","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16523809","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7776569/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRECO: A Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Reliable Application Placement in Hybrid Clouds","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"5093a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068395S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774976","isNumber":"7776557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774976","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7776557","articleId":"7776569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":7776570,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Amendola","affiliation":["DIET, Sapienza University of Rome"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Amendola","id":"37085346869"},{"name":"Nicola Cordeschi","affiliation":["DIET, Sapienza University of Rome"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Cordeschi","id":"37297940500"},{"name":"Enzo Baccarelli","affiliation":["DIET, Sapienza University of Rome"],"firstName":"Enzo","lastName":"Baccarelli","id":"37085366725"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5093-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5094-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7776570","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Cloud computing","Wireless communication","Optimization","Energy consumption","Mobile handsets","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","computer centres","quality of service","resource allocation","smart phones","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth management VM live migration","wireless fog computing","5G networks","virtual machine live migration","dynamic balanced networking physical resource usage","virtualized data-centers","reduced energy consumption","wireless channel","optimal tunable-complexity bandwidth manager","TCBM","QoS live migration","smartphone","access point","migration-induced communication energy minimization","service level agreement-induced hard constraint","total migration time","downtime","overall available bandwidth","dynamic balanced computing physical resource usage","SLA-induced hard constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth management","Optimization","Quality of Service","Energy-saving","Live migration"]}],"abstract":"Live virtual machine migration aims at enabling the dynamic balanced use of the networking/computing physical resources of virtualized data-centers, so to lead to reduced energy consumption.

WiFi-based solutions such as FingerPrinting (FP) are the most widely adopted techniques for positioning and provide better results if compared to other approaches. They require to compare WiFi Received Signal Strength (RSS) with an pre-computed radio map called fingerprint. The recently proposed Smart Probabilistic FingerPrinting (P-FP) algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the traditional FP approach without any accuracy detriment. On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as a new promising paradigm in the recent years, which extends traditional mobile cloud computing capabilities towards the edge of the network and enables location-aware services. In this paper we propose to offload Smart P-FP computation over a fog platform exploiting a novel distributed algorithm. Performance evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the analysis of: i) the amount of power saved and ii) the efficiency of candidate selection process for offloading. Having 2 or more devices in the vicinity contributing to the computation makes offloading beneficial from a power standpoint. The offloading effectiveness increases with the number of devices willing to contribute and the amount of data to be transferred. Power savings can be as high as 80% if compared with local computation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Probabilistic Fingerprinting for Indoor Localization over Fog Computing Platforms","publicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","doi":"10.1109/CloudNet.2016.43","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774976/7776557/07776573.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudNet.2016.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Smart Probabilistic Fingerprinting for Indoor Localization over Fog Computing Platforms","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776573/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523790","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Probabilistic Fingerprinting for Indoor Localization over Fog Computing Platforms","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"5093a039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070574S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774976","isNumber":"7776557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774976","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7776557","articleId":"7776573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776577,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Hsi Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Meng-Hsi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085741346"},{"name":"Min Dong","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Dong","id":"37402785200"},{"name":"Ben Liang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Liang","id":"37287338100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5093-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5094-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7776577","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":832},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user Mobile Cloud Offloading Game with Computing Access Point","abstract":"We consider a multi-user mobile cloud computing system with a computing access point (CAP) where each mobile user has multiple dependent tasks to be processed using a round-by-round schedule. The CAP can either process the received tasks from mobile users or offload them to the cloud. In each round, we aim to jointly optimize the offloading decisions of all users and the CAP, together with communication and processing resource allocation, to minimize the overall cost of energy, computation, and the maximum delay among all users. Since the centralized optimization problem is non-convex and mobile users may not follow the obtained solution, we further formulate a mobile cloud offloading game. We show the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) of this game and propose an algorithm to attain the NE.

To address this, mobile edge-cloud (MEC) has been proposed as an approach to bring resources closer to users. Recently, in contrast to conventional fixed cloud locations, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) has, with some added cost due to the necessary decentralization, enhanced MEC with new flexibility in placing MEC services to any nodes capable of virtualizing their resources. In this work, we address the question on how to optimally place resources among NFV-enabled nodes to support mobile multimedia applications with low latency requirement and when to adapt the current resource placements to address workload changes. We first show that the placement optimization problem is NP-hard and propose an online dynamic resource allocation scheme that consists of an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm and a detection mechanism to identify the time when the system will no longer be able to satisfy the applications' delay requirement. Our scheme takes into account the effect of current existing techniques (i.e., auto-scaling and load balancing). We design and implement a realistic NFV-enabled MEC simulated framework and show through extensive simulations that our proposal always manages to allocate sufficient resources on time to guarantee continuous satisfaction of the application latency requirements under changing workload while incurring up to 40% less cost in comparison to existing overprovisioning approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seamless Support of Low Latency Mobile Applications with NFV-Enabled Mobile Edge-Cloud","publicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","doi":"10.1109/CloudNet.2016.21","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774976/7776557/07776589.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudNet.2016.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Seamless Support of Low Latency Mobile Applications with NFV-Enabled Mobile Edge-Cloud","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776589/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523782","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seamless Support of Low Latency Mobile Applications with NFV-Enabled Mobile Edge-Cloud","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"5093a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078053S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774976","isNumber":"7776557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774976","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7776557","articleId":"7776589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776590,"authors":[{"name":"Rashmi Phalnikar","affiliation":["Dept. of IT, India"],"firstName":"Rashmi","lastName":"Phalnikar","id":"38186340500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5093-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5094-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7776590","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Unified modeling language","Computational modeling","Grammar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aspect-oriented programming","cloud computing","graph theory","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonfunctional requirement validation","cloud based systems","cloud computing","infrastructure-as-a-services","nonfunctional requirements","NFR","service selection process","aspect oriented paradigm","AOP","XML","graph transformation","remote patient monitoring","RPM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","User constraints","NFR Conflicts"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing that is based on Infrastructure as a Services model, allows the system administrators to identify resources or services to deploy their applications. Selection of the most appropriate provider for a particular application is a difficult task as there are huge numbers of services offered by considerable number of providers that are not directly comparable and have similar functionality. Additionally these systems must comply with non-functional requirements as they evolve. Certain traditional techniques are employed to verify the non-functional properties of critical systems at design time. In this paper, a new framework is suggested that supports the process of deploying applications in cloud providers, using a comparison of high level requirements predominantly non-functional requirements (NFR). Experiments have already been conducted with conclusive results wherein matching of user constraints during service selection process is done. The experiment uses Aspect Oriented Paradigm (AOP), XML and graph transformation. The relevance of the framework is illustrated using the Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) scenario. The results demonstrate that the model considerably improves the process by identifying conflicting NFR.

These platforms, such as Hadoop, are designed to run on large clusters.

In this paper we investigate the performance of a benchmark suite for Hadoop, running on both physical and virtual infrastructure in a testbed representative of an edge computing deployment. Experimental results show that in spite of a predictable performance loss in virtualized environments with respect to the native one, it is still convenient to execute Hadoop in a small cloud. This could be useful to pre-process data coming from sensors and/or mobile devices before sending them to a central cloud for further analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Benchmark testing","Virtualization","Hardware","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","mobile computing","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","edge cloud computing system","Big Data applications","data intensive applications","Hadoop","physical infrastructure","virtual infrastructure","virtualized environments","data preprocessing","sensors","mobile devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud performance","edge cloud","Hadoop","big data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776596","doi":"10.1109/CloudNet.2016.56","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","publicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7774976/7776557/07776596.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudNet.2016.56","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776596/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Edge Cloud Computing System for Big Data Applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16523779","htmlLink":"/document/7776596/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Edge Cloud Computing System for Big Data Applications","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"5093a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052746S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7774976","isNumber":"7776557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7774976","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7776557","articleId":"7776596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7776684,"authors":[{"name":"I.

For a long time space physics and aeronomy research has been data starved due to the great variety of natural time scales involved in the plasma phenomenology. We have started developing a new approach to the global ionospheric specification called Real-Time Assimilative Mapping (RTAM). The IRI-RTAM will use data from the Global Ionospheric Radio Observatory (GIRO) to smoothly transform IRI's background empirical maps of the ionospheric characteristics to match the observations. Such empirical assimilative modeling will provide a high-resolution, global picture of the ionospheric response to various short-term events observed during periods of storm activity or the impact of gravity waves coupling the ionosphere to the lower atmosphere, including timelines of the vertical restructuring of the plasma distribution. It will also contribute to the challenging task of providing a rapid insight into the temporal and spatial space weather development using the real-time GIRO data streams. The new assimilation technique \u201cupdates\u201d the IRI electron density distribution while preserving the overall integrity of IRI's typical ionospheric feature representations. The technique adjusts the coefficients of the spherical/diurnal expansions used by the CCIR and URSI-88 model to obtain the global subpeak electron density distribution. The set of global corrected coefficients can be generated as frequently as every 15 min and easily disseminated using a single real-time RTAM server operated by GIRO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776684/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","volume":"47","issue":"04","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Assimilation of GIRO data into a real-time IRI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assimilation of GIRO data into a real-time IRI","sourcePdf":"rds5990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039848S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"7771402","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"9","articleId":"7776684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7776689,"authors":[{"name":"G.

HF Doppler sounders together with modern data analysis techniques can provide comprehensive traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID) characteristics, including both horizontal and vertical TID velocities and wavelengths across the entire spectrum from periods of 1 min to over an hour. Atmospheric and Space Technology Research Associates LLC has developed a new system called \u201cTIDDBIT\u201d (TID Detector Built in Texas), and data will be presented from a TIDDBIT system deployed in Virginia. These results reinforce the relationship between atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) and TIDs. The TID propagation azimuths rotate through 360\u00b0 in 24 h, mimicking the rotation of the thermospheric winds but with approximately a 90\u00b0 offset. The rotation of TID azimuths and thermospheric winds in Virginia is similar to that observed previously by other Northern Hemisphere systems and opposite from the direction observed in Antarctica. These results illustrate the filtering effects that thermospheric neutral winds can have on the propagation of AGW. The completeness of the wave information obtained from the TIDDBIT system makes it possible to reconstruct the vertical displacement of isoionic contours over the \u223c200 km horizontal dimension of the sounder array. Such information will be relevant for understanding the seeding of irregularities, as well as for several operational needs involving navigation, communication, and surveillance systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","volume":"47","issue":"04","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of traveling ionospheric disturbances observed by the TIDDBIT sounder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of traveling ionospheric disturbances observed by the TIDDBIT sounder","sourcePdf":"rds5995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084813S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"7771402","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7776689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7776693,"authors":[{"name":"Abram R.

There has been little published work on this azimuth variation, either modeled or observational. We use broadband emissions from negative cloud-to-ground lightning strokes to study the azimuthal variations systematically. The data are from the Los Alamos Sferic Array, operating in the United States\u2019 southern Great Plains during 2005. We compare the observations to a model of lower-ionosphere reflection of radio waves. The model recapitulates the basic features of the time domain reflection waveforms rather well, except at the lowest frequencies. The model transfer function describing the vertical electric field at the receiver is symmetric about 90\u00b0 magnetic and about 270\u00b0 magnetic. Two noteworthy features of the azimuth variation are both predicted by the model, and seen in the data: First, at the lowest frequencies (<30 kHz) there is enhanced reflection for eastward propagation, relative to westward propagation. Second, at the higher frequencies (>50 kHz) there is an opposite enhancement, of the reflection for westward propagation, relative to eastward propagation. The westward enhancement at >50 kHz depends sensitively on range and is most evident in nighttime conditions, while the eastward enhancement at <30 kHz occurs at all ranges studied. Range-dependent frequency modulations of the transfer function are the least for magnetic northward propagation (duplicated by magnetic southward).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","volume":"47","issue":"04","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time domain waveform and azimuth variation of ionospherically reflected VLF/LF radio emissions from lightning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain waveform and azimuth variation of ionospherically reflected VLF/LF radio emissions from lightning","sourcePdf":"rds6005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070709S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"7771402","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7776693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7776710,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed E.

Conventional TR beamforming provides spatial focusing at the intended receiver; however, it does not yield perfect channel equalization. Time-reversed pilot can be normalized to provide perfect equalization at the expense of power level. This equalization is particularly important for high data rates where the bit error rate performance is dominated by internal noise due to intersymbol interference. To increase physical layer covertness, TR beamforming is combined with the multiple-signal-classification (MUSIC) technique to produce null fields at eavesdroppers. This technique is also applied to MIMO setups to eliminate interuser interference and hence increase system capacity. Differential TR is used to obtain and update pilot signals for passive moving receivers, i.e., those that cannot (or do not) transmit pilot signals. Time-reversed differential backscattered signal is able to provide satisfactory spatial and temporal focusing at the moving receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-reversal techniques for MISO and MIMO wireless communication systems","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","doi":"10.1029/2012RS005013","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7771305/07776710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2012RS005013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776710/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Time-reversal techniques for MISO and MIMO wireless communication systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"06","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-reversal techniques for MISO and MIMO wireless communication systems","sourcePdf":"rds6019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041653S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"7771305","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"13","articleId":"7776710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7776733,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Xu","id":"37960312800"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Yong Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zeng","orcid":"0000-0002-3670-0434","id":"38000332700"},{"name":"Chee-Cheon Chui","affiliation":["DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chee-Cheon","lastName":"Chui","id":"37086052281"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7776733","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Encoding","Receivers","Throughput","Random variables","Xenon","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erasure networks","spatial network coding","temporal network coding","network edges","time slots","finite temporal coding length","batch sparse code","BATS code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","erasure networks","finite-length coding","throughput analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07776733.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2636818","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2636818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-Temporal Network Coding Based on BATS Code","abstract":"Erasure networks can usually benefit from both spatial and temporal network coding, i.e., coding across packets both from different network edges as well as from different time slots.

For the original BATS code, the batch size is usually set as the temporal coding length M. With the proposed spatial-temporal BATS code, a larger batch size kM, with k being the min-cut of the network, is used so that the spatial network coding can be applied together with temporal network coding.

In particular, a multi-antenna secondary transmitter (ST) communicates with a multi-antenna secondary receiver (SR) in the presence of a primary receiver (PR). Considering only the statistical knowledge of the ST-PR channel gain, the QSM-CR scheme is investigated using a mean value (MV)-based power allocation strategy referred to as MV-based scheme. Furthermore, assuming that the ST-PR channel gain is perfectly known, the QSM-CR scheme is investigated using a power allocation method based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), referred to as CSI-based scheme. In each scheme, considering imperfect ST-SR channel estimation, we study the secondary system performance, where closed-form expressions for the average pairwise error probability (P\u0305E\u0305P\u0305) are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. A tight upper bounded average bit error rate is obtained using the derived P\u0305E\u0305P\u0305 expression. Moreover, simple approximate expressions are obtained to get insights on the system diversity and channel estimation errors' effects. Numerical results, which match with simulations, illustrate the robustness of QSM in enhancing the overall system performance in the presence of estimation errors.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7879183/07776737.pdf","startPage":"981","endPage":"991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature Spatial Modulation in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems With Imperfect Channel Estimation and Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature Spatial Modulation in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems With Imperfect Channel Estimation and Limited Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776737/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16743408","htmlLink":"/document/7776737/","volume":"65","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Discovery Grant (DG) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and Research Development Fund (RDF) from Lakehead University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature Spatial Modulation in MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems With Imperfect Channel Estimation and Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"tcomm-afana-2636289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130968S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7879183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7879183","articleId":"7776737","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776748,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7776748/li-2636283-small.gif","p":["Tao Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

Each SC has a large cache and stores a copy of all contents in the BS. A user's content request can be either handled by the SC for free if it has enough energy, or by the BS that has a cost. Each user has a finite cache and can store some most popular contents. We propose an efficient coded content caching schemes and an optimal transmission schemes for this system to maximally off-load the data traffic from the macro BS to the energy-harvesting SCs, and therefore minimize the power consumption from the grid. Specifically, the proposed coded caching scheme stores fractions of some most popular contents, such that contents requested from multiple users can be simultaneously delivered by the BS or SC. Moreover, the optimal transmission policy is formulated and solved as a Markov decision process. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed coded caching and transmission schemes can provide significantly higher traffic off-loading capability compared with systems with no caching or with uncoded caching, as well as systems that employ heuristic-based transmission schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07776748.pdf","startPage":"906","endPage":"917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Off-Loading With Energy-Harvesting Small Cells and Coded Content Caching","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7855844/7776748-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Off-Loading With Energy-Harvesting Small Cells and Coded Content Caching","volume":"65","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776748/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669150","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776748/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61329101"},{"fundingName":"Leading Talents Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"00201510"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Program of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20151117161854942"},{"fundingName":"China Major State Basic Research Development Program (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316100(2)"},{"fundingName":"European Union","grantNumber":"CoNHealth 294923"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Traffic Off-Loading With Energy-Harvesting Small Cells and Coded Content Caching","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2636283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.28696S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7776748","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776751,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Shi","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7811156/7776751/shi-2637059-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Shi (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

We utilize an expectation-maximization algorithm to iteratively refine this coarse grid and illustrate that each updated grid point can be simply achieved by the root of a certain polynomial.

similar. In order to assist with the diagnosis, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. These commonly rely on a fixed scale classifier that scans CT images, recognizes textural lung patterns, and generates a map of pathologies. In a previous study, we proposed a method for classifying lung tissue patterns using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), with an architecture designed for the specific problem. In this study, we present an improved method for training the proposed network by transferring knowledge from the similar domain of general texture classification. Six publicly available texture databases are used to pretrain networks with the proposed architecture, which are then fine-tuned on the lung tissue data. The resulting CNNs are combined in an ensemble and their fused knowledge is compressed back to a network with the original architecture. The proposed approach resulted in an absolute increase of about 2% in the performance of the proposed CNN. The results demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in the field of medical image analysis, indicate the textural nature of the problem and show that the method used for training a network can be as important as designing its architecture.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7839252/07776792.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisource Transfer Learning With Convolutional Neural Networks for Lung Pattern Analysis","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2636929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2636929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Multisource Transfer Learning With Convolutional Neural Networks for Lung Pattern Analysis","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638865","pubMedId":"28114048","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7776792/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Bern University Hospital"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)","grantNumber":"156511"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisource Transfer Learning With Convolutional Neural Networks for Lung Pattern Analysis","sourcePdf":"jbhi-mougiakakou-2636929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13954S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7776792","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776798,"authors":[{"name":"Guangmo Amo Tong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570650/7811157/7776798/tong-2627811-small.gif","p":["Guangmo (Amo) Tong (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA, under the supervision of Dr. D.-Z.

An activation state identifies who are the active users who have adopted the target innovation. Given an activation state of a certain diffusion, effector detection aims to reveal the active users who are able to best explain the observed state. In this paper, we tackle the effector detection problem from two perspectives. The first approach is based on the influence distance that measures the chance that an active user can activate its neighbors. For a certain pair of users, the shorter the influence distance, the higher probability that one can activate the other. Given an activation state, the effectors are expected to have short influence distance to active users while long to inactive users. By this idea, we propose the influence-distance-based effector detection problem and provide a 3-approximation. Second, we address the effector detection problem by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. We prove that the optimal MLE can be obtained in polynomial time for connected directed acyclic graphs. For general graphs, we first extract a directed acyclic subgraph that can well preserve the information in the original graph and then apply the MLE approach to the extracted subgraph to obtain the effectors. The effectiveness of our algorithms is experimentally verified via simulations on the real-world social network.","doi":"10.1109/TCSS.2016.2627811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570650/7811157/07776798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2016.2627811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811157","startPage":"151","endPage":"163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effector Detection in Social Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effector Detection in Social Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16597891","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776798/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11301480"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007834","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, China","grantNumber":"2014A610030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effector Detection in Social Networks","sourcePdf":"tcss-tong-2627811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125221S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570650","isNumber":"7811157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570650","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7811157","articleId":"7776798","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776799,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangdong Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37600921400"},{"name":"Haojie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Haojie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37716642000"},{"name":"Kun Liu","affiliation":["College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37291519900"},{"name":"Tiegen Liu","affiliation":["College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Tiegen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293262900"},{"name":"Yuedong Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yuedong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085789098"},{"name":"Chunyu Ma","affiliation":["College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Chunyu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37073943500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7776799","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Schematic diagram of four commonly intrusions.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"672KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7792275/7776799/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2636747.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7792275/7776799/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2636747.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Security","Support vector machines","Data acquisition","Optical fiber sensors","Bandwidth","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","feature extraction","optical fibres","statistical analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid feature extraction","intrusion discrimination","optical fiber perimeter security system","recognition efficiency","fence cutting","waggling","cable knocking","fence climbing","common intrusions","support vector machine","pipeline stream","configurable filter bank","hybrid feature vector","time domain","zero crossing rate","statistics kurtosis","frequency domain","bandwidth segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filter bank","hybrid feature","intrusion discrimination","optical fibers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776799","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid feature extraction-based intrusion discrimination scheme for an optical fiber perimeter security system, which concurrently possesses high classification rate and high efficiency.

The high efficiency also arises for two reasons: For one thing, the configurable filter bank works in a pipeline stream; for another, an efficient support vector machine is employed to classify hybrid vectors.

However, coupled voltage transformation matrix to correlate voltage of overhead transmission lines and induction bars has not been achieved mathematically due to the lack of equivalent electric circuit model for analyzing the physical phenomenon. Moreover, exact spatial positions of overhead transmission lines are typically unknown and dynamic in practice. In this paper, a technique based on non-contact capacitive-coupling and assisted by magnetic-field sensing for monitoring voltage of overhead transmission lines was designed and implemented. The technique in this paper is demonstrated on a single-circuit transmission line as an example, while it is also applicable for multi-circuit transmission lines. The capacitive coupling between overhead transmission lines and induction bars were modeled as lumped capacitors, and then, the equivalent electric circuit model was established. The coupled voltage transformation matrix to correlate voltage of overhead transmission lines and induced voltage of induction bars mathematically was formed accordingly. This paper was also carried out to analyze the effect of ground wires, sensitivity of induction bars, the ability of high-frequency transient measurement, and the intrinsic capacitance of a measurement instrument. The exact spatial positions of overhead transmission lines were acquired by integrating magnetic-field sensing with the stochastic optimization algorithm. The methodology was verified by simulation on the 10-kV single-circuit three-phase overhead transmission lines taking non-ideality of signal measurement in account, and wavelet de-noising algorithm was supplemented to filter the interferences. A scaled testbed to experiment the technique was built to monitor 220 V overhead transmission lines in the lab, and also the typical waveform of a high-frequency switching surge (up to 1 kHz), which was generated by a programmable ac source. The reconstructed results match well with the actual values. This technique can largely improve transient-fault identification over traditional potential transformers by the virtue of the increased upper measurement limit and bandwidth through capacitive coupling. Moreover, it can be implemented with low-cost copper induction bars and compact magnetoresistive sensors, enabling large-scale application to realize sectional monitoring in the wide area.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7828062/07776800.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2636862","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2016.2636862","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776800","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transmission lines","Bars","Transmission line measurements","Voltage measurement","Monitoring","Capacitance","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance measurement","capacitive sensors","earthing","frequency measurement","inductance measurement","magnetic field measurement","magnetic sensors","magnetoresistive devices","mathematical analysis","matrix algebra","potential transformers","power overhead lines","voltage measurement","wavelet transforms","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncontact capacitive-coupling","magnetic-field-sensing-assisted technique","voltage monitoring","high-voltage transmission line","coupled voltage transformation matrix","induction bar","mathematical analysis","equivalent electric circuit model","single-circuit transmission line","multi-circuit transmission line","lumped capacitor","ground wire","high-frequency transient measurement","measurement instrument","stochastic optimization algorithm","single-circuit three-phase overhead power transmission line","signal measurement","wavelet denoising algorithm","interference filtering","programmable AC source","transient-fault identification","potential transformer","compact magnetoresistive sensor","voltage 10 kV","voltage 220 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitive coupling","magnetic-field sensing","voltage monitoring","overhead transmission lines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Non-Contact Capacitive-Coupling-Based and Magnetic-Field-Sensing-Assisted Technique for Monitoring Voltage of Overhead Power Transmission Lines","accessionNumber":"16618339","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2017","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776800/","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003803","fundingName":"Seed Funding Program for Basic Research and Small Project Funding Program from The University of Hong Kong"},{"fundingName":"ITF Tier 3 funding","grantNumber":"ITS/104/13 and ITS/214/14"},{"fundingName":"RGC-GRF","grantNumber":"HKU 704911P"},{"fundingName":"University Grants Committee of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"AoE/P-04/08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Contact Capacitive-Coupling-Based and Magnetic-Field-Sensing-Assisted Technique for Monitoring Voltage of Overhead Power Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhu-2636862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088192S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7828062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7828062","articleId":"7776800","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7776805,"authors":[{"name":"Adriaan Barri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Zwijnaarde, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/7852546/7776805/barri-2637164-small.gif","p":["Adriaan Barri received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Vrije\n Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussel, Belgium, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the VUB Department of Electronics and\n Informatics (ETRO) in 2015.

Visual quality assessment (VQA) aims to find an estimate of the impact of such alterations to be used, e.g., during algorithm/system design, optimization and comparisons (which employ benchmarking), or in quality monitoring. A wide variety of VQA approaches have been developed that seek agreement with the response of the human visual system to visual signal stimuli, which is very difficult to model, and hence, quite a challenge to predict. In the particular case of benchmarking and monitoring SLAs, VQA can have a big impact on the product or service under study or the parties involved, hence, one should be very cautious in trying to model the accordance with the human perception. Moreover, it is important to take the disagreement and sometimes conflicting opinions of subjects into account. Integrating machine learning (ML) modules can lead to faster and more accurate objective quality measures, but the available ML algorithms are not necessarily suitable for the task of objective quality assessment. This paper gives examples of data-driven modules in the context of benchmarking and SLAs. To this end, we continue on the work of Hemami and Reibman in this area and elaborate in particular on VQA employing so-called probabilistic pairwise preference and objective quality thresholds to enable real-life visual quality benchmarking and monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7776805/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669219","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Modules for Objective Visual Quality Assessment Focusing on Benchmarking and SLAs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"iMinds ICON project HD2R"},{"fundingName":"H2020 project ImmersiaTV"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Modules for Objective Visual Quality Assessment Focusing on Benchmarking and SLAs","sourcePdf":"jstsp-barri-2637164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105012S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7852546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7852546","articleId":"7776805","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7776807,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7874239/7776807/li-2630302-small.gif","p":["Wei Li (M\u201905) received the B.E. degree from Shandong University, in 1985, the M.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es of Rennes, France, in 1996, all in electrical engineering.

This paper studies a two-layer LDM with one layer used for providing a global service through a single frequency network (SFN), and the other for providing local coverage/services, such as location targeted advertising or local content insertion. The pilot boosting effect on SNR and co-channel interference is also analyzed. The LDM upper layer can be used to deliver time-division multiplexed mobile-HD and 4k-UHD services. The LDM lower layer with a negative SNR threshold can reliably provide seamless local coverage/service from each SFN transmitter without coverage gaps among adjacent SFN transmitter service areas. No directional receiving antenna is required for the local service reception and receivers simply tune into the stronger signal. In such LDM systems, while the upper layer is operating in a traditional SFN mode, the lower layer operates in a special form of distributed MIMO or gap-filler mode to provide targeted local coverage. For implementing the two-layer system introduced in this paper, only ATSC 3.0 baseline technologies are used, i.e., there is no need to modify the ATSC 3.0 standard. Given the upper and lower layers' data rate requirements and the SNR thresholds, the lower layer power, with respect to the upper layer (injection level), can be optimized to maximize upper and lower layer performance and coverage. Since the advertisement time of the local service is typically less than 20% of the program time, nonreal time could be used to play-back the local content at five times the transmission bit rate for better (audio/video) service quality.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2016.2630302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7874239/07776807.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2016.2630302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using LDM to Achieve Seamless Local Service Insertion and Local Program Coverage in SFN Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Using LDM to Achieve Seamless Local Service Insertion and Local Program Coverage in SFN Environment","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723029","htmlLink":"/document/7776807/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CRC-ETRI Research Collaboration Project on Next Generation DTV Transmission Systems"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion Grant through the Korean government (MSIP, Development of Service and Transmission Technology for Convergent Realistic Broadcast","grantNumber":"R0101-15-294"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61420106008 and 61671297"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B07022"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Media Processing","grantNumber":"STCSM12DZ2272600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Scientific and Innovative Action Plan of Shanghai","grantNumber":"15DZ1100101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using LDM to Achieve Seamless Local Service Insertion and Local Program Coverage in SFN Environment","sourcePdf":"tbc-li-2630302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11767S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7874239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7874239","articleId":"7776807","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7776808,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed S.

We want to assess: 1) if there is a category of cognitive radio algorithms that consistently outperforms the others and 2) how sensitive different algorithms are to suboptimal parameter setting. Our approach is to take a representative set of well-known classes of cognitive radio algorithms, mix and match them throughout thousands of simulations, and determine which seem to perform better. We find that choosing a cognitive radio algorithm means finding a balance between the best-case performance obtained by optimally setting all parameters, and the behavior in uncontrolled, unknown environments, where suboptimal decisions are likely to be made. The approaches we consider, namely reinforcement learning, optimization metaheuristics, multi-armed bandit solutions, and supervised learning, greatly differ in their performance. For example, schemes that are able to achieve a high throughput in our simulation study are more sensitive to suboptimally set parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2016.2636845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801348","startPage":"381","endPage":"396","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/7801348/07776809.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Algorithms Coexisting in a Network: Performance and Parameter Sensitivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7776809/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Algorithms Coexisting in a Network: Performance and Parameter Sensitivity","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)","grantNumber":"10/IN.1/I1007 and 13/RC/2077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Algorithms Coexisting in a Network: Performance and Parameter Sensitivity","sourcePdf":"tccn-hess-2636845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110881S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7801348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7801348","articleId":"7776809","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776811,"authors":[{"name":"Frank J.

The simulation results show that the recurrence formula is a good alternative for estimating the capacity of Nakagami fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2636826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07776816.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2636826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channel With BPSK/QPSK Modulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channel With BPSK/QPSK Modulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776816/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16723235","htmlLink":"/document/7776816/","volume":"21","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channel With BPSK/QPSK Modulations","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yang-2636826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087535S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7776816","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776822,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Shu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","College of Computer and Information Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China","National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment, China Research Institute of Radiowave Propagation, Qingdao, China","School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7776822/shu-2636318-small.gif","p":["Feng Shu was born in 1973.

By utilizing TDOA measurements and EC, the problem of estimating target position is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic optimization. Following this, the approximate analytic solution of target position is obtained by using the method of Lagrange multipliers and deleting the infeasible roots of polynomial in the Lagrange multiplier. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with EC for three typical scenarios, even in the worst case, e.g., in the presence of large TDOA measurement errors with even target being far from the subastral point. However, the existing TDOA localization methods will deviate from the CRLB with EC as the measurement error of TDOA increases. Thus, the proposed method is more robust compared with the existing methods. In addition, the EC has a significant impact on the TDOA localization performance. Compared with the case of no EC, the EC can make a one-order-magnitude improvement in localization precision.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2636318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07776822.pdf","startPage":"9283","endPage":"9292","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2636318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Analytic Quadratic-Optimization Solution for TDOA-Based Passive Multi-Satellite Localization With Earth Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Analytic Quadratic-Optimization Solution for TDOA-Based Passive Multi-Satellite Localization With Earth Constraint","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7776822/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16606920","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment, China Research Institute of Radiowave Propagation, Qindao, China","grantNumber":"201500013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271230 and 61472190"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Approximate Analytic Quadratic-Optimization Solution for TDOA-Based Passive Multi-Satellite Localization With Earth Constraint","sourcePdf":"access-shu-2636318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133157S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7776822","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7776825,"authors":[{"name":"Linjia Chang","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7776825/chang-2636298-small.gif","p":["Linjia Chang (S\u201914) received the B.

Due to timing errors in circuits, there may be missed messages in intra-chip communications, equivalent to transiently missing connections. In this paper, we investigate the performance of message-passing LDPC decoders in the presence of missing connections. We prove concentration and convergence theorems that validate the use of density evolution performance analysis. Arbitrarily small error probability is not possible with missing connections, but we find suitably defined decoding thresholds for communication systems with binary erasure channels under peeling decoding, as well as binary symmetric channels under Gallager A and B decoding. We see that decoding is robust to missing wires, as decoding thresholds degrade smoothly. Moreover, there is a stochastic facilitation effect in Gallager B decoders with missing connections. We also conduct finite-length simulations, compare the decoding sensitivity to channel noise and to missing wiring, and perform preliminary error-tolerant manufacturing yield analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07776825.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2636298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of LDPC Decoders With Missing Connections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance of LDPC Decoders With Missing Connections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776825/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669144","htmlLink":"/document/7776825/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007245","fundingName":"Systems on Nanoscale Information fabriCs (SONIC), one of the six SRC STARnet Centers, sponsored by MARCO and DARPA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of LDPC Decoders With Missing Connections","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chang-2636298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12368S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7776825","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776828,"authors":[{"name":"A.

polarized water spiral antenna with polarization reconfigurability and low profile. It is basically an Archimedean spiral antenna with two water arms and fed by a parallel stripline. A conducting plate is used as the reflecting plane for unidirectional radiation.

In particular, we perform joint beamforming and artificial noise optimization in an effort to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. The optimization is performed in the presence of artificial noise generated by both transmitter and legitimate receivers. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We develop a minorization-maximization algorithm to solve the problem exactly and the results can therefore be used to benchmark existing methods.

Traditional manual screening is time consuming, operator dependent, and error prone; hence, automated detection approach is highly demanded in clinical practice. However, automated polyp detection is very challenging due to high intraclass variations in polyp size, color, shape, and texture, and low interclass variations between polyps and hard mimics. In this paper, we propose a novel offline and online three-dimensional (3-D) deep learning integration framework by leveraging the 3-D fully convolutional network (3D-FCN) to tackle this challenging problem. Compared with the previous methods employing hand-crafted features or 2-D convolutional neural network, the 3D-FCN is capable of learning more representative spatio-temporal features from colonoscopy videos, and hence has more powerful discrimination capability. More importantly, we propose a novel online learning scheme to deal with the problem of limited training data by harnessing the specific information of an input video in the learning process. We integrate offline and online learning to effectively reduce the number of false positives generated by the offline network and further improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments on the dataset of MICCAI 2015 Challenge on Polyp Detection demonstrated the better performance of our method when compared with other competitors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776845/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638876","pubMedId":"28114049","htmlLink":"/document/7776845/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"21","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integrating Online and Offline Three-Dimensional Deep Learning for Automated Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Videos","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"CUHK 14202514 and CUHK 14203115"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61233012"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"(JCYJ20160429190300857)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Online and Offline Three-Dimensional Deep Learning for Automated Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Videos","sourcePdf":"jbhi-yu-2637004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106902S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7776845","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776846,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjun Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sanjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086042256"},{"name":"Meng Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0003-2396-469X","id":"37292643900"},{"name":"Yunzhou Li","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunzhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37086040098"},{"name":"Yingyang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingyang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085630106"},{"name":"Bingli Jiao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingli","lastName":"Jiao","orcid":"0000-0001-6579-0179","id":"37282213500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7776846","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Network security","Physical layer","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absolute secure wire-line communication method","wiretapper","wire-line point-to-point communication","information theory","full-duplex node","wiretapper observation channel impair","secure communication","physical layer security model","colluding structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","artificial noise","full duplex","absolute security"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a security method for wire-line point-to-point communication based on the information theory.

Computational complexity is reduced by at least 93% compared to the LLR calculation based on the max-log MAP algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2016.2619583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7874231/07776849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2016.2619583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874231","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Non-Square Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Demapper for DOCSIS 3.1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Non-Square Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Demapper for DOCSIS 3.1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723045","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776849/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development program of MSIP/IITP [Development of the Advanced Broadcasting System based on FTN]","grantNumber":"B0101-16-1362"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Non-Square Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Demapper for DOCSIS 3.1","sourcePdf":"tbc-ahn-2619583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12458S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7874231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7874231","articleId":"7776849","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776852,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Ki Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Ki","lastName":"Hong","orcid":"0000-0001-7664-7140","id":"37086172967"},{"name":"Han-Shin Jo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Control Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han-Shin","lastName":"Jo","id":"37531785900"},{"name":"Cheol Mun","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Korea National University of Transportation, Cheongju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheol","lastName":"Mun","id":"37266741300"},{"name":"Jong-Gwan Yook","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Gwan","lastName":"Yook","id":"37277003100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7776852","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","MISO","MIMO","Precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","feedback","MIMO communication","radio networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters","receiving antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SP single-output spatial channel model","DP multiple-input spatial channel model","SP receiver","randomly rotated single-polarized receiver","limited feedback system","DP transmitter","dual-polarized transmitter","wireless communication","receiving antenna","user equipment","channel imperfection","multiuser polarized MISO downlink","opportunistic polarization-matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Opportunistic polarization-matching","polarization-mismatch","DPSP MISO downlink","space-polarization division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"Channel imperfections, obstacles, and the unpredictable movements of user equipment can create polarization-mismatch at the receiving antenna, which decreases the power of the received signal in practical wireless communications.

Especially, when multiple applications share and compete for a storage resource, the operating system is required to schedule the IO requests for the maximum throughput. Recently, the flash-based storage, solid-state drive (SSD) has been popularly used in various computing systems and traditional scheduling algorithms have been researched and tuned for the emerging flash-based storages. However, the SSDs suffer from the contention problem caused by multiple I/O requests and experience significant performance degradation. This is mainly due to the concurrently accesses to a finite set of flash memory chips. In this paper we propose Dynamic Load Balanced Queuing (DLBQ) that reorders the I/O requests and evenly distributes the accesses on flash memory chips to avoid contention. For that purpose, we have introduced a virtual time method which chases the run-time status of the SSD. We have evaluated the throughput and latency of DLBQ versus the four I/O schedulers with micro benchmarks and server benchmarks. The experimental results show that the throughput of DLBQ is improved by 11 percent on a 128 GB SSD and 15 percent on a 256 GB SSD while ensuring a bounded latency.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2016.2636840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7921657/07776864.pdf","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2636840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Load Balancing of Dispatch Scheduling for Solid State Disks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Load Balancing of Dispatch Scheduling for Solid State Disks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776864/","publicationDate":"1 June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16880672","htmlLink":"/document/7776864/","volume":"66","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"R7117-16-0233"},{"fundingName":"Development of Application Program"},{"fundingName":"Optimization Tools for High Performance Computing Systems"},{"fundingName":"Memory Division of Samsung Electronics"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Load Balancing of Dispatch Scheduling for Solid State Disks","sourcePdf":"tc-ro-2636840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165947S","chronDate":"June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7921657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7921657","articleId":"7776864","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776872,"authors":[{"name":"Chuanbo Wen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8359228/7776872/wen-2629464-small.gif","p":["Chuanbo Wen received the B.Sc. degrees in mathematics and in applied mathematics in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from Henan University, Kaifeng, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2015.","From 2015 to 2016, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Computer Science, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, U.K. He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China.

Each sensor node in the network communicates with its neighbors according to the network topology described by a directed graph. The fading phenomena of measurements are assumed to occur in a random way and the attenuation coefficients of the fading measurements are described by a set of random variables with known stochastic properties. By solving two sets of matrix difference equations, an upper bound for the filtering error covariance is presented. Subsequently, with the topology information of the sensor network, such an upper bound is minimized by properly designing the filter parameters. Moreover, the performance of the proposed filter is investigated through establishing sufficient conditions ensuring that the trace of the upper bound is bounded. The relationship between the filter performance and the mean of attenuation coefficient is also discussed.

The new method utilizes the measurements of normal electric-field components at discrete points along the metallic chamber's wall-near the chamber-wall boundary, the normal-field components are dominant, while the tangential components vanish. The inversion algorithm fully incorporates the resonant features of the low-loss chamber. A numerical study is used to quantify the imaging performance of using this technique compared with the traditional unbounded domain imaging. An experimental system is presented where the electric field is collected using 24 antennas distributed in three circumferential layers around an object of interest located inside the circular-cylindrical metallic chamber. For collecting the normal component of the field, two types of linearly polarized antennas are investigated: \u03bb/4 monopole antennas and specially designed reconfigurable antennas (RAs), both projecting perpendicularly out from the chamber walls into the enclosure. The measured data are calibrated and then inverted using a multiplicatively regularized finite-element contrast source inversion algorithm. Using 3-D reconstructions of simple dielectric targets, it is shown that utilizing the RAs improves imaging performance due to a reduction in the modeling error introduced in the inversion algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Antennas","Dielectrics","Image reconstruction","Microwave imaging","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric fields","finite element analysis","image reconstruction","linear antennas","microwave imaging","monopole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["normal electric-field components","metallic resonant chamber","3-D microwave imaging approach","resonant air-filled metallic chamber","chamber-wall boundary","tangential components","inversion algorithm","low-loss chamber","imaging performance","unbounded domain imaging","distributed antennas","circumferential layer","circular-cylindrical metallic chamber","linearly polarized antenna","monopole antennas","reconfigurable antennas","multiplicatively regularized finite-element contrast source inversion algorithm","3-D reconstruction","dielectric target","modeling error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D imaging","contrast source inversion (CSI)","finite-element method (FEM)","imaging in perfect electrically conducting (PEC)","inverse scattering problems","microwave imaging (MWI)","modeling error reduction","reconfigurable antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776873","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2627554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7870723/07776873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2627554","startPage":"923","endPage":"933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7870723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Imaging Using Normal Electric-Field Components Inside Metallic Resonant Chambers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Imaging Using Normal Electric-Field Components Inside Metallic Resonant Chambers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776873/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7776873/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16721511","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Imaging Using Normal Electric-Field Components Inside Metallic Resonant Chambers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-lovetri-2627554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077026S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7870723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7870723","articleId":"7776873","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776876,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Wang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8000716/7776876/wang-2633989-small.gif","p":["Guang Wang received the B.E. degree in automation from Harbin\n Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2010, and the M.E. and Ph.D degrees in control science and engineering from\n Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","Since 2016, he has been with the College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, where he is currently a\n Lecturer.

A novel kernel direct decomposition (KDD) algorithm is proposed and a KDD-based nonlinear quality-related fault detection approach is designed. The proposed KDD algorithm first maps original process variables into feature space to deal with the nonlinearities among these variables. Feature matrix is then directly decomposed into two orthogonal parts according to its full correlation with output matrix without building any regression model. Compared with conventional nonlinear methods, the KDD-based approach has the following advantages: 1) it is simpler in design as it omits the steps of constructing a regression model like kernel partial least squares (KPLS); 2) its performance is more stable because it extracts the full correlation information of feature matrix unlike KPLS-based methods which only use the partial correlation information of several selected latent variables; and 3) it has a simpler diagnosis logic since it only uses two statistics to determine the type of fault while most existing methods need four. Simulations on a literature example and a simulated industrial process are used to demonstrate the advantages of the new method.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2633989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2633989","startPage":"1565","endPage":"1574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8000716/07776876.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Kernel Direct Decomposition-Based Monitoring Approach for Nonlinear Quality-Related Fault Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Kernel Direct Decomposition-Based Monitoring Approach for Nonlinear Quality-Related Fault Detection","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776876/","accessionNumber":"17099265","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776876/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"61503039 and 61503040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Kernel Direct Decomposition-Based Monitoring Approach for Nonlinear Quality-Related Fault Detection","sourcePdf":"tii-wang-2633989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150903S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8000716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8000716","articleId":"7776876","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7776878,"authors":[{"name":"Xianming Kong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Xianming","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086001690"},{"name":"Kenny Squire","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Kenny","lastName":"Squire","id":"37086146751"},{"name":"Erwen Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Erwen","lastName":"Li","id":"37085415318"},{"name":"Paul LeDuff","affiliation":["School of Chemical, Biological Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"LeDuff","id":"37086001893"},{"name":"Gregory L.

To this end, we first compute and obtain the lower bound and upper bound of the optimal system energy efficiency based on the property analysis of the formulated system energy efficiency problem. Then, to reduce the signaling overhead and calculation complexity, we propose a forward and backhaul link energy efficiency optimization scheme (FBEEOS) to approach the achieved system energy efficiency bounds. The system energy efficiency is proved to be convergent in a non-decreasing manner in FBEEOS. The simulation results confirm the properties of FBEEOS. In addition, our results show that the transmission power optimization is necessary to achieve higher system energy efficiency though its contribution to total energy consumption is negligible. This is a result of the effect of transmission power on interference and throughput, and needs to be taken into consideration when we optimize the system energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2636821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07776881.pdf","startPage":"1080","endPage":"1093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2636821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward and Backhaul Link Optimization for Energy Efficient OFDMA Small Cell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776881/","displayDocTitle":"Forward and Backhaul Link Optimization for Energy Efficient OFDMA Small Cell Networks","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668638","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776881/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471060"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2015ZX03001025"},{"fundingName":"Funds for Creative Research Groups of China","grantNumber":"61421061"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Innovation Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward and Backhaul Link Optimization for Energy Efficient OFDMA Small Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-nie-2636821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151323S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7776881","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776884,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenbin Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7776884/zhang-2637081-small.gif","p":["Zhenbin Zhang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201916) was born in Shandong,\n China, in 1984.

However, the computation time for classical DMPC schemes increases exponentially with the number of switching states and, compared to modulation-based controllers, real-time implementation may not be feasible. In this paper, two computationally efficient DMPC schemes with hexagon candidate region (HCR) and triangle candidate region (TCR) for torque and power control of three-level neutral-point clamped back-to-back converters in wind turbine systems with permanent-magnet synchronous generator are proposed. By an appropriate selection of the candidate regions, the number of reasonable switching states is drastically reduced which saves computation time up to 55% for HCR and up to 83% for TCR, respectively. The computational efficiency improvements and the control performances of the proposed DMPC schemes are compared and validated by real-time implementations on an field programmable gate array (FPGA) system and by measurement results at a lab-constructed test bench. The achieved control performance of the proposed methods is comparable with that of the classical DMPC, while the computation times are drastically reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07776884.pdf","startPage":"8018","endPage":"8034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally Efficient DMPC for Three-Level NPC Back-to-Back Converters in Wind Turbine Systems With PMSG","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Torque","Wind turbines","Predictive control","Cost function","Power control","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","permanent magnet generators","power control","power convertors","predictive control","synchronous generators","torque control","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally efficient DMPC","three-level NPC back-to-back converter","wind turbine systems","PMSG","direct model predictive control","multilevel converters","switching states","modulation-based controllers","hexagon candidate region","HCR","triangle candidate region","TCR","power control","torque control","three-level neutral-point clamped back-to-back converters","permanent-magnet synchronous generator","field programmable gate array system","FPGA system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computationally efficient direct model predictive control (CE-DMPC)","FPGA implementation","three-level neutral-point diode clamped (3L-NPC) back-to-back converter","wind turbine system with permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Computationally Efficient DMPC for Three-Level NPC Back-to-Back Converters in Wind Turbine Systems With PMSG","volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7776884/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"16880313","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally Efficient DMPC for Three-Level NPC Back-to-Back Converters in Wind Turbine Systems With PMSG","sourcePdf":"tpel-hackl-2637081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115104S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7776884","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776885,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Koochakzadeh","affiliation":["La Jolla, CA, USA","University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7820239/7776885/kooch-2637309-small.gif","p":["Ali Koochakzadeh (S\u201913) was born in Tehran, Iran, on November\n 01, 1990.

Coprime and nested sampling are well-known deterministic sampling techniques that operate at rates significantly lower than Nyquist, and yet allow perfect reconstruction of the spectra of wide sense stationary signals. However, theoretical guarantees for these samplers assume ideal conditions such as synchronous sampling, and ability to perfectly compute statistical expectations. This paper studies the performance of coprime and nested samplers when these assumptions are violated. Using a general grid-based signal model that applies to both spatial and temporal line spectrum estimation, the effect of perturbations in sampling instants is evaluated by deriving fundamental Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRB) for line spectrum estimation with perturbed samplers. For the first time, simplified expressions for the Fisher Information matrix for perturbed coprime and nested samplers are derived, which explicitly highlight the role of coarray. Even in presence of perturbations, it is possible to resolve O(M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) spectral lines under appropriate conditions on the size of the grid. The effect of finite data on the CRB is also studied, and necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the CRB decreases monotonically to zero with the number of measurements, even when there are more sources than sensors. Finally, the theoretical results derived in this paper are supported by extensive numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2637309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2637309","startPage":"1607","endPage":"1621","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7820239/07776885.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Uniform and Sparse Non-Uniform Samplers In Presence of Modeling Errors: A Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound Based Study","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7820239/7776885-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Uniform and Sparse Non-Uniform Samplers In Presence of Modeling Errors: A Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound Based Study","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2017","volume":"65","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776885/","accessionNumber":"16614940","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776885/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000005","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Defense"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS 1553954"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Performance of Uniform and Sparse Non-Uniform Samplers In Presence of Modeling Errors: A Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound Based Study","sourcePdf":"tsp-koochakzadeh-2637309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11416S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7820239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7820239","articleId":"7776885","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7776886,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With the small magnitude of input voltages (and the resulting small noise margins) needed for proper operation, sense-amplifier based FF designs (SAFF) are susceptible to single-event effects (SEE). Single event upset (SEU) performance of high-speed SAFF designs is investigated in this paper for 16-nm bulk FinFET CMOS technology. SEU cross-sections for SAFF are evaluated over particle LET, temperature, and operating frequency. Results show significant increases in cross-sections as a function of frequency, but not so for temperature. Results presented in this work can guide designers to harden the SAFF that satisfies their specific circuit SEU error rate constraints.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Latches","Flip-flops","Single event upsets","FinFETs","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","field effect transistors","flip-flops","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sense-amplifier based flip-flop design","bulk FinFET CMOS process","high-speed logic circuits","conventional flip-flop designs","differential flip-flop designs","high-speed SAFF designs","specific circuit SEU error rate constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-section","differential flip-flop","FinFET","high-speed operation","sense-amplifier","single-event"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2636865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869239/07776894.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2636865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Event Performance of Sense-Amplifier Based Flip-Flop Design in a 16-nm Bulk FinFET CMOS Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-Event Performance of Sense-Amplifier Based Flip-Flop Design in a 16-nm Bulk FinFET CMOS Process","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776894/","volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776894/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16721534","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Soft Error Consortium and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-13-C-0063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Event Performance of Sense-Amplifier Based Flip-Flop Design in a 16-nm Bulk FinFET CMOS Process","sourcePdf":"tns-jiang-2636865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056863S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7869239","articleId":"7776894","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7776898,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Busquets-Monge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7776898/monge-2636839-small.gif","p":["Sergio Busquets-Monge (SM\u201911) was born in Barcelona, Spain.

A suitable phase voltage pattern with minimum number of switching transitions is presented for the n-level three-phase case. Subsequently, it is extended to higher number of switching transitions per fundamental cycle and to higher number of phases. Simulation results with three, four, and five levels; three and five phases; and several frequency-modulation-index values are presented to validate the proposed modulation strategy. Experimental results obtained with a four-level three-phase dc-ac converter prototype are also provided.

The framework first separates the overlapped sources via blind channel estimation and then conducts novel maximum-likelihood-based multicumulant classification (MLMC) for each of the sources. MLMC employs multiple cumulants of arbitrary orders and arbitrary lags as discriminating features and a maximum likelihood ratio test for decision making. Hence, MLMC maximizes the probability of correct classification under the condition that the selected cumulants are utilized. Moreover, both the case with perfect channel estimation and the practically more relevant case with blind channel estimations, called fast independent component analysis and natural gradient independent component analysis, are presented to facilitate the signal separation process. Extensive simulations are also conducted to verify the validity and the superiority of the proposed framework and the MLMC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2636324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07776899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2636324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","startPage":"6089","endPage":"6101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Modulation Classification of Overlapped Sources Using Multiple Cumulants","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Modulation Classification of Overlapped Sources Using Multiple Cumulants","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026842","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776899/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61525101, 61227801 and 61601055"},{"fundingName":"National Key Technology R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2015ZX03002008-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Modulation Classification of Overlapped Sources Using Multiple Cumulants","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2636324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080114S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7776899","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7776909,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Minimal radiation-induced threshold voltage shift across a variety of transistor types is observed. Off-state leakage current of nMOSFET transistors exhibits a strong gate bias dependence, indicating electrostatic gate control of the sub-fin region and the corresponding parasitic conduction path are the largest concern for radiation hardness in FinFET technology.

In a 14-nm FinFET technology, the modeling indicates devices with high channel stop doping show the most robust response to TID allowing stable operation of ring oscillators and the SRAM bit-cell with minimal shift in critical operating characteristics.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/23/7869239/7776909-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16721531","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776909/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of TID Process, Geometry, and Bias Condition Dependence in 14-nm FinFETs and Implications for RF and SRAM Performance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Sandia\u2019s Laboratory-Directed Research and Development program"},{"fundingName":"Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration","grantNumber":"DE-AC0494AL85000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006537","fundingName":"Vanderbilt University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-13-C-0063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Analysis of TID Process, Geometry, and Bias Condition Dependence in 14-nm FinFETs and Implications for RF and SRAM Performance","sourcePdf":"tns-king-2634538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190972S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7869239","articleId":"7776909","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7776919,"authors":[{"name":"Long Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8337043/7776919/jin-2627579-small.gif","p":["Long Jin received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2011 and 2016, respectively.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.

Unlike prior work on face reconstruction that requires large photo collections, we formulate an approach to adapt to photo collections with a high diversity in both the number of images and the image quality. To achieve this, we incorporate prior knowledge about face shape by fitting a 3D morphable model to form a personalized template, following by using a novel photometric stereo formulation to complete the fine details, under a coarse-to-fine scheme. Our scheme incorporates a structural similarity-based local selection step to help identify a common expression for reconstruction while discarding occluded portions of faces. The evaluation of reconstruction performance is through a novel quality measure, in the absence of ground truth 3D scans.

However, most existing approaches (e.g., WiFi and infrared-based methods) for indoor localization heavily rely on infrastructure, which is neither scalable nor pervasively available. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization and tracking approach, termed VMag, that does not require any infrastructure assistance. The user can be localized while simply holding a smartphone. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first exploration of fusing geomagnetic and visual sensing for indoor localization. More specifically, we conduct an in-depth study on both the advantageous properties and the challenges in leveraging the geomagnetic field and visual images for indoor localization. Based on these studies, we design a context-aware particle filtering framework to track the user with the goal of maximizing the positioning accuracy. We also introduce a neural-network-based method to extract deep features for the purpose of indoor positioning. We have conducted extensive experiments on four different indoor settings including a laboratory, a garage, a canteen, and an office building. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of VMag over the state of the art with these four indoor settings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Magnetic and Visual Sensors for Indoor Localization: Infrastructure-Free and More Effective","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2016.2636750","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7879458/07776928.pdf","startPage":"874","endPage":"888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2016.2636750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Magnetic and Visual Sensors for Indoor Localization: Infrastructure-Free and More Effective","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7776928/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16759911","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore's Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1","grantNumber":"T1 251RES1415"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572169 and 61472266"},{"fundingName":"National University of Singapore Suzhou Research Institute, Suzhou"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Magnetic and Visual Sensors for Indoor Localization: Infrastructure-Free and More Effective","sourcePdf":"tmm-liu-2636750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099502S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7879458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7879458","articleId":"7776928","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7776929,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Stoddard","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Stoddard","id":"37085825625"},{"name":"Ammon Gruwell","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Ammon","lastName":"Gruwell","id":"37085823410"},{"name":"Peter Zabriskie","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Zabriskie","id":"37085823025"},{"name":"Michael J.

From a cost perspective, it is often important to ensure the desired coverage ratio for the FoI within a maximum allowable response (MAR) time, by using a minimum number of sensors in MSNs. The literature on determining the minimum number of sensors for the desired coverage ratio assumes that the FoI is unbounded to overcome the border effects. Since the entire sensing sphere of the sensors near the boundary may not be useful for the coverage, the number of sensors estimated without the border effects is lower than the actual value. In this paper, we estimate the minimum number of sensors required to achieve a desired coverage ratio in a given MAR time for a 3D FoI. We term this problem (\u03b1; V; T)-coverage problem, where a, V , and T are the desired coverage ratio, average speed of sensors, and MAR time, respectively. We assume straight line mobility model for the sensors and consider the border effects while deriving the expected sensing volume of a sensor useful in coverage. We also consider the restriction of sampling rate of the sensors in this analysis. We discuss the application of our analysis for a non-hyper-rectangle shaped FoI, random walk, and waypoint mobility models, and also the impact of neglecting the border effects. Our numerical and simulation results demonstrate the significance of border effects on the number of sensors and also the relationship between the coverage ratio, MAR time, sampling period, and the sensing range.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2016.2636832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8000754/07776932.pdf","endPage":"2449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Coverage Under Border Effects in Three-Dimensional Mobile Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2016.2636832","startPage":"2436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Coverage Under Border Effects in Three-Dimensional Mobile Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776932/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17149452","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776932/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Coverage Under Border Effects in Three-Dimensional Mobile Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-gupta-2636832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151524S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8000754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8000754","articleId":"7776932","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7776933,"authors":[{"name":"Marissa A.

In this situation, a connection to energized equipment may be more common. When potential and current transformers are present in switchgear, it is usually desirable to make the probe connections to the secondary of these transformers. Generally, these connections are made in switchgear metering compartments, which are presumed to have low arc-flash risk due to the limited exposure to energized power conductors. Often in these situations only shock hazard is considered and arc-flash hazard is not, but is it safe to assume there is no arc-flash hazard? The NFPA 70E-2015 Standard states that opening doors to expose bare energized parts requires arc-flash personal protective equipment (PPE). The standard also states that work on control circuits with exposed energized parts greater than 120 V requires arc-flash PPE. Therefore, according to the NFPA 70E, in a control cabinet containing, for example, voltage transformers with exposed primary terminals above 120 V, an arc-flash hazard exists and arc-flash PPE is required. However, the question remains, what level is the hazard and how should it be assessed? This paper will evaluate arc-flash energy in metering compartments, determine if arc-flash hazard should be a legitimate concern when working in energized metering compartments, and improve overall awareness when working in these situations.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2016.2637313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7880726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2016.2637313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7880726/07776933.pdf","startPage":"1694","endPage":"1703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc-Flash Risks in Switchgear Metering Compartments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Arc-Flash Risks in Switchgear Metering Compartments","volume":"53","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776933/","publicationDate":"March-April 2017","accessionNumber":"16756562","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776933/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc-Flash Risks in Switchgear Metering Compartments","sourcePdf":"tia-spencer-2637313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148844S","chronDate":"March-April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7880726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7880726","articleId":"7776933","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7776934,"authors":[{"name":"You Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7776934/han-2636280-small.gif","p":["You Han (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering and automation from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2012.

The release of TV white space band by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for cognitive access provides additional bandwidth to solve the DSRC spectrum scarcity problem. However, FCC requires portable devices to use significantly lower transmitting power than fixed devices, which creates a challenging coexistence environment for portable (e.g., vehicular) and fixed (e.g., IEEE 802.22) networks. In this paper, we address the coexistence problem between a vehicular and an 802.22 network via resource allocation. We first formulate the coexistence problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, to which three algorithms are developed. The first algorithm converts the MINLP into a convex program and obtains a near-optimal solution to the initial MINLP. In the other two algorithms, we first convert the MINLP into an integer programming (IP) problem. Then, we solve the linear program relaxation of the IP and obtain a fractional solution. Thereafter, two rounding algorithms are developed to round the fractional solution based on column-sparse packing and dependent rounding techniques, respectively. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithms with an optimal MINLP solver through numerical examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07776934.pdf","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2636280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2636280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation Algorithms Supporting Coexistence of Cognitive Vehicular and IEEE 802.22 Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Resource management","Wireless communication","IEEE 802.22 Standard","FCC","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","convex programming","integer programming","telecommunication traffic","vehicular ad hoc networks","wireless regional area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation algorithms","cognitive vehicular","IEEE 802.22 networks","dedicated short range communication","DSRC band","wireless traffic demands","vehicular networks","TV white space band","federal communications commission","FCC","cognitive access","DSRC spectrum scarcity","portable devices","fixed devices","coexistence environment","resource allocation","mixed integer nonlinear programming","MINLP problem","convex program","integer programming","linear program relaxation","column sparse packing","dependent rounding techniques","optimal MINLP solver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive vehicular networks","channel allocation","linear programming","submodular set function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Algorithms Supporting Coexistence of Cognitive Vehicular and IEEE 802.22 Networks","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7776934/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668607","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Toyota InfoTechnology Center Co.

The proposed CVNS neuron resulted in an optimal ASIC implementation and is suitable for neurochips with on-chip learning. The VLSI implementation of the neuron is carried out using current-mode circuits.

The algorithm solves a sequence of (separable) strongly convex problems and maintains feasibility at each iteration. Convergence to a stationary solution of the original nonconvex optimization is established. Our framework is very general and flexible and unifies several existing successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithms. More importantly, and differently from current SCA approaches, it naturally leads to distributed and parallelizable implementations for a large class of nonconvex problems. This Part I is devoted to the description of the framework in its generality.

To demonstrate the applicability, we consider a mission-driven service-oriented MANET that must handle dynamically arriving tasks to achieve multiple conflicting objectives. We devise a trust-based heuristic algorithm based on auctioning with local knowledge of node status to solve this node-to-task assignment problem with multiobjective optimization (MOO) requirements. Our trust-based heuristic algorithm has a polynomial runtime complexity, rather than an exponential runtime complexity as in existing work, thus allowing dynamic node-to-task assignment to be performed at runtime. It outperforms a nontrust-based counterpart using blacklisting techniques while performing close to the ideal solution quality with perfect knowledge of node status over a wide range of environmental conditions. We conduct extensive sensitivity analysis of the results with respect to key design parameters and alternative trust protocol designs. We also develop a table-lookup method to apply the best trust protocol parameter settings upon detection of dynamically changing environmental conditions to maximize MOO performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/7875178/07776949.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust-Based Task Assignment With Multiobjective Optimization in Service-Oriented Ad Hoc Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2016.2636454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2016.2636454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Trust-Based Task Assignment With Multiobjective Optimization in Service-Oriented Ad Hoc Networks","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16724840","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7776949/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Laboratory"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-12-1-0445"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000005","fundingName":"Department of Defense (DoD) through the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&E))"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust-Based Task Assignment With Multiobjective Optimization in Service-Oriented Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tnsm-chen-2636454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117196S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"7875178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7875178","articleId":"7776949","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776956,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Luo","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/8293754/7776956/luo-2636337-small.gif","p":["Hao Luo (M\u201915) received the B.E. degree in electrical\n engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2007, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Duisburg\u2013Essen, Duisburg, Germany, in\n 2012 and 2016, respectively.","He is an Associate Professor with the School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.

In this paper, we consider a photo response non-uniformity analysis and focus on the detection of small forgeries. For this purpose, we adopt a recently proposed paradigm of multi-scale analysis and discuss various strategies for its implementation. First, we consider a multi-scale fusion approach, which involves combination of multiple candidate tampering probability maps into a single, more reliable decision map. The candidate maps are obtained with sliding windows of various sizes and thus allow to exploit the benefits of both the small- and large-scale analyses. We extend this approach by introducing modulated threshold drift and content-dependent neighborhood interactions, leading to improved localization performance with superior shape representation and easier detection of small forgeries. We also discuss two novel alternative strategies: a segmentation-guided approach, which contracts the decision statistic to a central segment within each analysis window and an adaptive-window approach, which dynamically chooses analysis window size for each location in the image. We perform extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and realistic forgeries and discuss in detail practical aspects of parameter selection. Our evaluation shows that the multi-scale analysis leads to significant performance improvement compared with the commonly used single-scale approach. The proposed multi-scale fusion strategy delivers stable results with consistent improvement in various test scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7831515/07776959.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2016.2636089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2636089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7831515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Scale Analysis Strategies in PRNU-Based Tampering Localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forgery","Forensics","Image segmentation","Detectors","Correlation","Reliability","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image forensics","image fusion","image representation","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale analysis strategies","PRNU-based tampering localization","unsupervised tampering localization","digital image forensics","photo response nonuniformity analysis","forgery detection","multiscale fusion","multiple candidate tampering probability maps","decision map","sliding windows","modulated threshold drift","content-dependent neighborhood interactions","localization performance","shape representation","segmentation-guided approach","parameter selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital image forensics","tampering localization","decision fusion","multi-scale analysis","photo-response non-uniformity","Markov random fields"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Scale Analysis Strategies in PRNU-Based Tampering Localization","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7776959/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16619689","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"U1636202, 61402295 and 61572329"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160328144421330"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Scale Analysis Strategies in PRNU-Based Tampering Localization","sourcePdf":"tifs-huang-2636089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170429S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7831515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7831515","articleId":"7776959","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776964,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Lanza di Scalea","affiliation":["NDE and Structural Health Monitoring Laboratory, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7870770/7776964/scale-2637299-small.gif","p":["Francesco Lanza di Scalea was born in Palermo, Italy, in 1969.

Specifically, the study proposes new adaptive weights applied to the beamforming array that are based on the physics of the propagating waves, specifically the displacement structure of the propagating longitudinal (L) mode and shear (S) mode that are naturally coexisting in a solid. The wave mode structures can be combined with the wave geometrical spreading to better filter the array (in a matched filter approach) and improve its focusing ability compared to static array weights. This paper also proposes compounding, or summing, images obtained from the different wave modes to further improve the array gain without increasing its physical aperture. The wave mode compounding can be performed either incoherently or coherently, in analogy with compounding multiple frequencies or multiple excitations. Numerical simulations and experimental testing demonstrate the potential improvements obtainable by the wave structure adaptive weights compared to either static weights in conventional delay-and-sum focusing, or adaptive weights based on geometrical spreading alone in minimum-variance distortionless response focusing.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/58/7870770/7776964-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16721727","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7776964/","pubMedId":"28114014","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic Imaging in Solids Using Wave Mode Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006283","fundingName":"U.S. Federal Railroad Administration","grantNumber":"FR-RRD-0027-11-01 and DTFR-5316C00024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1362144"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Ultrasonic Imaging in Solids Using Wave Mode Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tuffc-lanzadiscalea-2637299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090824S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7870770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7870770","articleId":"7776964","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7776965,"authors":[{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West-Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7845749/7776965/scuta-2637314-small.gif","p":["Gesualdo Scutari (S\u201905\u2013M\u201906\u2013SM\u201911)\n received the Electrical Engineering and Ph.D. degrees (both with honors) from the University of Rome \u201cLa\n Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

The proposed algorithm is rooted in the homotopy continuation techniques commonly used to solve systems of nonlinear equations. Homotopy methods find the solution of a target system by smoothly deforming the solution of a start system which can be trivially solved. Unlike previously proposed IA algorithms, the homotopy continuation technique allows us to solve the IA problem for both unstructured (i.e., generic) and structured channels such as those that arise when time or frequency symbol extensions are jointly employed with the spatial dimension. To this end, we consider an extended system of bilinear equations that include the standard alignment equations to cancel the interference, and a new set of bilinear equations that preserve the desired dimensionality of the signal spaces at the intended receivers. We propose a simple method to obtain the start system by randomly choosing a set of precoders and decoders, and then finding a set of channels satisfying the system equations, which is a linear problem. Once the start system is available, standard prediction and correction techniques are applied to track the solution all the way to the target system. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm and prove that, for many feasible systems and a sufficiently small continuation parameter, the algorithm converges with probability one to a perfect IA solution. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to consistently find solutions achieving the maximum number of degrees of freedom in a variety of MIMO X networks with or without symbol extensions. Further, the algorithm provides insights into the feasibility of IA in MIMO X networks for which theoretical results are scarce.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homotopy Continuation for Spatial Interference Alignment in Arbitrary MIMO X Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2637310","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7835338/07776968.pdf","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2637310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7776968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Homotopy Continuation for Spatial Interference Alignment in Arbitrary MIMO X Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7776968/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2017","publicationDate":"1 April1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16637890","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"TEC2013-47141-C4-R, TEC2016-75067-C4-4-R, MTM2014-57590-P and BES-2014-069786"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Homotopy Continuation for Spatial Interference Alignment in Arbitrary MIMO X Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-fanjul-2637310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1561S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7835338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7835338","articleId":"7776968","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7776972,"authors":[{"name":"Jiahu Qin","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7924432/7776972/qin-2636810-small.gif","p":["Jiahu Qin (M\u201912) received the first Ph.D. degree in control\n science and engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, and the second Ph.D. degree in systems and\n control from the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.","Since July 2013, he has been with the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, where he is\n currently a Professor.

If fail data collection can be terminated early, the tester time as well as the volume of fail data will be reduced. Test reordering can enhance the ability to terminate the process early without affecting the quality of diagnosis. In this paper, test reordering targets logic defects based on information that is derived during defect diagnosis. The defect diagnosis procedure is enhanced to identify tests that are useful for defect diagnosis across a sample of faulty instances of a circuit. Tests that are determined to be useful for more faulty instances of a circuit are placed earlier in the test set based on the expectation that the same tests will be useful for other faulty instances of the circuit. The experimental results for logic defects in benchmark circuits support the effectiveness of this approach and indicate that test reordering helps to terminate fail data collection early without impacting the diagnosis quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7776981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"25","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16759764","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7776981/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reordering Tests for Efficient Fail Data Collection and Tester Time Reduction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2013-TJ-2469"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reordering Tests for Efficient Fail Data Collection and Tester Time Reduction","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bodhe-2628321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095607S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7882729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7882729","articleId":"7776981","onlineDate":"07 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7777184,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With the logical centralization of controllers and a global network overview, SDN brings us a chance to strengthen our network security. However, SDN also brings us a dangerous increase in potential threats. In this paper, we apply a deep learning approach for flow-based anomaly detection in an SDN environment. We build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for an intrusion detection system and train the model with the NSL-KDD Dataset. In this work, we just use six basic features (that can be easily obtained in an SDN environment) taken from the forty-one features of NSL-KDD Dataset. Through experiments, we confirm that the deep learning approach shows strong potential to be used for flow-based anomaly detection in SDN environments.","doi":"10.1109/WINCOM.2016.7777224","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764433/7777180/07777224.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WINCOM.2016.7777224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning approach for Network Intrusion Detection in Software Defined Networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning approach for Network Intrusion Detection in Software Defined Networking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777224/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16523029","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning approach for Network Intrusion Detection in Software Defined Networking","confLoc":"Fez, Morocco","sourcePdf":"m1570316371-tang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065032S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764433","isNumber":"7777180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764433","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"7777180","articleId":"7777224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7777252,"authors":[{"name":"Octavian M.

Our approach, which makes use of the PCAP (Processor Configuration Access Port) available on the latest generation of Xilinx Zynq Systems-on-Chip, allows the processing system to operate a fast partial reconfiguration of the programmable logic with little logic overhead. The advantages brought by this technique, like scalability, high performance and dynamic management of the programmable logic are being put to use in implementing laboratory works involving running the mathematical models of energy harvesting sources. This allows the same FPGA development board to be used by several student at the same time for running their applications. Thus, this is part of a larger research effort in which we aim to develop remote online hardware design laboratories with hardware multitasking support.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-enabled hardware multitasking applications in energy harvesting laboratories","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium for Design and Technology in Electronic Packaging (SIITME)","doi":"10.1109/SIITME.2016.7777252","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Symposium for Design and Technology in Electronic Packaging (SIITME)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764429/7777235/07777252.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIITME.2016.7777252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-enabled hardware multitasking applications in energy harvesting laboratories","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777252/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522961","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-enabled hardware multitasking applications in energy harvesting laboratories","confLoc":"Oradea, Romania","sourcePdf":"C_P_Machidon_SIITME2016_p94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049541S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764429","isNumber":"7777235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764429","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7777235","articleId":"7777252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777289,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian Andrei Peri\u015foar\u0103","affiliation":["Research Center for Spatial Information (CEOSpaceTech), University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian Andrei","lastName":"Peri\u015foar\u0103","id":"37085377723"},{"name":"Drago\u015f Ioan S\u0103c\u0103leanu","affiliation":["Universitatea din Bucuresti, Bucuresti, RO"],"firstName":"Drago\u015f Ioan","lastName":"S\u0103c\u0103leanu"},{"name":"Rodica Stoian","affiliation":["Research Center for Spatial Information (CEOSpaceTech), University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Rodica","lastName":"Stoian","id":"38185969400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4445-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4446-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777289","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"In the design phase of a communication system, computer simulations allow us to evaluate the system performances in order to choose the optimal techniques, algorithms, and parameters values for the constituent blocks, and to discover the design issues as soon as possible in order to correct them.

Hence, fault diagnosis of rotating components, like rolling bearings, can be done by analyzing the external relevant information obtained by measurements, in order to evaluate their internal states. The most widely used method for detection and fault diagnosis of rolling bearings is based on vibration measurements. In signal processing, there are many applications of neural networks (NN) combined with spectral analysis, using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The function approximation using neural networks is a complex task for problems with high dimension of the input space, like those based on signal spectral analysis. In this paper, some neural estimation aspects of spectral components of vibration signals for rolling bearings fault diagnosis are discussed. Inner race defect of bearings is considered in simulations. The goal is to find a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model for estimating spectral components, with computational complexity comparable with FFT algorithm, but easier to implement in hardware. Different FFNN architectures, with different data sets and training conditions, are analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777297/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16522968","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777297/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On spectral component estimation using neural networks for rolling bearing fault diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On spectral component estimation using neural networks for rolling bearing fault diagnosis","confLoc":"Oradea, Romania","sourcePdf":"F_P_Nicolau_SIITME2016_p290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059732S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764429","isNumber":"7777235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764429","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7777235","articleId":"7777297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777423,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Jouni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Lebanese International University, Beirut, Lebanon","University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, URS 006, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Jouni","id":"37086060533"},{"name":"Mariam Issa","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communications, Lebanese International University, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Mariam","lastName":"Issa","id":"37086062360"},{"name":"Adnan Harb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Lebanese International University, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Harb","id":"37271619100"},{"name":"Gilles Jacquemod","affiliation":["University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, URS 006, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Jacquemod","id":"37388868900"},{"name":"Yves Leduc","affiliation":["University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, URS 006, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Leduc","id":"38016586400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5281-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5282-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777423","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":533},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Conferences","Breast cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cancer","neural nets","patient diagnosis","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast cancer detection","breast cancer classification","machine learning","artificial neural networks","low-complexity architecture","pattern recognition","optimal activation function","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Back propagation","Biomedical","Breast Cancer","CMOS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777423","abstract":"Early detection of cancer or any disease is among the main keys to its cure.

Feature selection is a problem of choosing a subset of relevant features to increase the execution speed of the algorithm and the classification accuracy. It also removes inappropriate features to increase the precision and improve the performances. There has been much effort for solving the feature selection problem up to now and many researchers have proposed and developed many feature selection algorithms in this purpose. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method based on neural network and machine learning. This new algorithm tends to highlight the best features among existing ones: new weighting-based method of the input features is used in the neural network to choose the best features. Performances show that this method selects the best features on simulated data.","doi":"10.1109/IMCET.2016.7777431","startPage":"81","endPage":"85","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Multidisciplinary Conference on Engineering Technology (IMCET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764654/7777413/07777431.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Multidisciplinary Conference on Engineering Technology (IMCET)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCET.2016.7777431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New feature selection method based on neural network and machine learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Conferences","Machine learning algorithms","Neurons","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","feature selection","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection method","neural network","machine learning","classification accuracy","weighting-based method","simulated data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature selection","neural network","machine learning","classification","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"New feature selection method based on neural network and machine learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777431/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16523085","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New feature selection method based on neural network and machine learning","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"p81-challita.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052814S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764654","isNumber":"7777413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764654","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7777413","articleId":"7777431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7777443,"authors":[{"name":"Nancy Fadel","affiliation":["Holy Spirit University of Kaslik (USEK), Faculty of Engineering, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Fadel","id":"37088331944"},{"name":"Youssef Nasser","affiliation":["American University of Beirut, Beirut, LB"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Nasser","id":"37294663300"},{"name":"Charles Yaacoub","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik (USEK)"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Yaacoub","id":"37392081100"},{"name":"Hassan Artail","affiliation":["American University of Beirut, Beirut, LB"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Artail","id":"37268564700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5281-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5282-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777443","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"abstract":"Cellular networks are facing a constant growth of traffic due to an increasing number of services requiring high throughputs.

The current trend is to efficiently separate the waste in order to appropriately deal with it. The separation must be done as early as possible in order to reduce the contamination of waste by other materials. The need to automate this process is a significant facilitator for waste companies. This research aims to automate waste sorting by applying machine learning techniques to recognize the type of waste from their images only. Two popular learning algorithms were used: deep learning with convolution neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). Each algorithm creates a different classifier that separates waste into 3 main categories: plastic, paper and metal using only 256 \u00d7 256 colored png image of the waste. The accuracies of the two classifiers are compared in order to choose the best one and implement it on a raspberry pi 3. The pi controls a mechanical system that guides the waste from its initial position into the corresponding container. However, in this paper we only compare the two machines learning techniques and implement the best model on the pi in order to measure its speed of classification. SVM achieved high classification accuracy 94.8% while CNN achieved only 83%. SVM also showed an exceptional adaptation to different types of wastes. NVIDIA DIGITS was used for training the CNN while Matlab 2016a was used to train the SVM. The SVM model was finally implemented on a Raspberry pi 3 where it produced quick classification, taking on average 0.1s per image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777453/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16523098","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777453/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing deep learning and support vector machines for autonomous waste sorting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing deep learning and support vector machines for autonomous waste sorting","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"p207-sakr.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062958S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764654","isNumber":"7777413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764654","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7777413","articleId":"7777453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7777476,"authors":[{"name":"Can \u00c7ali\u015fkan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"\u00c7ali\u015fkan","id":"37085742093"},{"name":"\u0130lker Kalyoncu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u0130lker","lastName":"Kalyoncu","id":"38252554700"},{"name":"Emre Ozeren","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Ozeren","id":"37595415900"},{"name":"Mehmet Kaynak","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics, Im Technologiepark, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Kaynak","id":"37302118300"},{"name":"Yasar Gurbuz","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yasar","lastName":"Gurbuz","id":"37267652000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-044-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777476","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":681},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Gain","Silicon germanium","Bandwidth","Noise measurement","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ge-Si alloys","low noise amplifiers","microwave amplifiers","phased array radar","power amplifiers","radar receivers","radar transmitters","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband low noise medium power amplifier","X-band phased array RADAR","transmitter/receiver core module","low noise amplifier","LNA","noise figure","size 0.25 mum","gain 23.6 dB","frequency 10 GHz","power 190 mW","bandwidth 7 GHz","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power amplifiers","linearity","silicon germanium","heterojunction bipolar transistors","transformer","low-noise amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777476","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777476.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband low noise SiGe medium power amplifier for X-Band Phased Array applications","abstract":"This paper presents a Medium Power Amplifier (MPA) for X-Band Phased Array RADAR applications in 0.25\u03bcm SiGe technology.

this work, we describe monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuit (MMIC) Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and mixer designs for U-Band, also known as the WR19 waveguide band (40\u201360 GHz). The LNAs were fabricated in NGC's 35 nm InP HEMT MMIC process. The MMICs were packaged in WR19 waveguide housings and tested for noise, both at room temperature and cryogenically. We present the results, including a comparison to the state-of-the-art, and discuss applications for amplifiers in this frequency range. To date, these are the first cryogenic 35 nm InP MMIC results covering the 40\u201360 GHz range. We achieved a noise temperature less than 30 K over the 40\u201360 GHz range, when the amplifiers were cryogenically cooled. These results are comparable with other results in the literature, and we believe are the lowest reported for MMICs in the 50\u201360 GHz range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777495/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522856","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic low noise MMIC amplifiers for U-Band (40\u201360 GHz)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic low noise MMIC amplifiers for U-Band (40\u201360 GHz)","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067995S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7777501,"authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Szilagyi","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Laszlo","lastName":"Szilagyi","id":"37085394834"},{"name":"David Schoeniger","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Schoeniger","id":"37688716500"},{"name":"Ronny Henker","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronny","lastName":"Henker","id":"37319651000"},{"name":"Frank Ellinger","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ellinger","id":"37275628500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-044-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777501","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777501","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Inductors","Current measurement","Bandwidth","Receivers","Gain measurement","Optical buffering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","microwave amplifiers","operational amplifiers","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical receiver amplifier","optical communications","transimpedance amplifier","TIA","six-stage limiting amplifier","shared inductive peaking","line driver","offset compensation loop","data rate","low-power CMOS process","small-signal measurements","normal operation","NOP","low-power operation","LPO","large-signal measurements","output buffer","total power balance","size 28 nm","bit rate 30 Gbit/s","frequency 21.5 GHz","frequency 5.95 GHz","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","power 23.5 mW","power 11.5 mW","power 14 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical receiver","transimpedance amplifier","limiting amplifier","power-bandwidth adaptivity"]}],"abstract":"The design of a receiver (RX) amplifier for optical communications consisting of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), a six-stage limiting amplifier (LA) with shared inductive peaking, a line driver and an offset compensation loop is presented.

The circuit was fabricated in a 28 nm, low-power CMOS process and electrical measurements confirmed the functionality of the RX and adaptive concept.

In the proposed architecture, a nonlinear driver stage is introduced in both Carrier and Peaking branches, with the aim to actualize a phase distortion compensation mechanism directly at MMIC level, thus heavily mitigating the linearity issues at system level. In addition, the power consumption of the driver stages has been minimized by adopting an uneven drain bias voltage.

The design of this combiner allows the load modulation principle in three-way DPA structures to be realized with simpler elements, where the design of standard Impedance Inverter Network (IIN) due to extremely small value is very challenging and not practical. The proposed combiner is calculated for a three-way DPA with 2 mm GaN-HEMTs from Nitronex and simulated in ADS. The simulation result shows a very good load modulation for the amplifier, which confirms the theoretical expectation for a three-way DPA.

A two-stage PA is implemented using an InGaP/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor process and only the collector bias voltage of the power stage of the PA is modulated by a supply modulator. The gain of the power stage is decreased due to the saturated operation in the ET mode and the power burden of the drive stage is increased, lowering the overall efficiency of the ET PA. Through the idle current optimization of the power stage of the ET PA, the burden of the drive stage is reduced and the overall efficiency of the ET PA is enhanced. The intermodulation distortions (IMDs) of the ET PA change according to the idle current. The optimum linearity performance is achieved at the idle current where the magnitudes of IMD3 and IMD5 of the ET PA are low with a similar value. It is found that the optimal idle current for the high efficiency and linearity are identical. The optimized ET PA performs a power-added efficiency of 44.3% and an evolved universal terrestrial radio access adjacent channel leakage ratio of -35.2 dBc at an average power of 27 dBm and operating frequency of 1.85 GHz for a long term evolution signal having a peak-to-average power ratio of 7.5 dB, a bandwidth of 10 MHz, and a 16-quadrature amplitude modulation.","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777510","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777510.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of idle current in envelope tracking power amplifier for efficiency and linearity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of idle current in envelope tracking power amplifier for efficiency and linearity","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777510/","accessionNumber":"16522811","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777510/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of idle current in envelope tracking power amplifier for efficiency and linearity","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056497S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7777520,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This chipset is suited for applications requiring both fixed and tunable LO which is made possible due to a wideband frequency multiplier (\u00d716) based local-oscillator (LO) signal source and a wideband on-chip antenna designed to be used with an external replaceable silicon lens. The Tx can deliver up to 6 dBm output power at 240 GHz and the 3-dB bandwidth is 40 GHz. For the Rx, the peak conversion gain is 10 dB and the NF is 15 dB while the 3-dB bandwidth is 28 GHz. The chipset is integrated in a low loss Rogers 4350B COB (chip-onboard) packaging. For communication applications where high IF bandwidth is required, stepped impedance low-pass filters with minimum group delay variations were implemented on the PCB to negate the low-pass characteristics introduced by the bondwire. The measured 6-dB IF bandwidth is 13 GHz. By using this chipset for high data rate communication, the measured EVM for BPSK modulation is 24% at 20 Gbps while the EVM is 30% at 25 Gbps. For the QPSK modulation scheme, an EVM of 24% is measured at 24 Gbps. These results are for a link of 70 cm and without calibrating the effect of the IF cables and without any channel equalization.","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777520","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777520.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband fully integrated SiGe chipset for high data rate communication at 240 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A wideband fully integrated SiGe chipset for high data rate communication at 240 GHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777520/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522839","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777520/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband fully integrated SiGe chipset for high data rate communication at 240 GHz","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060844S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777521,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Malz","affiliation":["IHCT, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Malz","id":"37085345875"},{"name":"Philipp Hillger","affiliation":["IHCT, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Hillger","id":"37085742956"},{"name":"Bernd Heinemann","affiliation":["IHP GmbH, Im Technologiepark 25, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Heinemann","id":"37268256400"},{"name":"Ullrich R.

Three different circuits were fabricated using 50 nm gate length metamorphic high electron mobility transistors (mHEMT) in combination with grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) lines with 14 \u03bcm ground-to-ground spacing. First, cascode and stacked-FET configurations at 240 GHz are compared. The stacked configuration exhibits a more broadband small-signal gain response and a 1.3 dB enhancement of output power compared to the cascode cell. Subsequently, a power amplifier cell for operation at 280 GHz was designed and realized. The stacked-FET configuration is chosen due to its superior performance. The 280 GHz power cell demonstrates more than 8.3 dB of small-signal gain from 267 to 302 GHz (12.3%), with a maximum gain of 9.6 dB at 282 GHz, and an output-referred 2 dB compression point of 3.5 dBm.","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777522","startPage":"189","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777522.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 280 GHz stacked-FET power amplifier cell using 50 nm metamorphic HEMT technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A 280 GHz stacked-FET power amplifier cell using 50 nm metamorphic HEMT technology","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777522/","accessionNumber":"16522814","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777522/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 280 GHz stacked-FET power amplifier cell using 50 nm metamorphic HEMT technology","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059063S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7777523,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoya Takano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kyoya","lastName":"Takano","id":"37535227100"},{"name":"Kosuke Katayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kosuke","lastName":"Katayama","id":"38246635200"},{"name":"Shuhei Amakawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuhei","lastName":"Amakawa","id":"37298487900"},{"name":"Takeshi Yoshida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37420881000"},{"name":"Minoru Fujishima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Fujishima","id":"37085348838"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-044-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777523","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Mixers","Frequency modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Interference","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","image processing","intermediate-frequency amplifiers","millimetre wave integrated circuits","millimetre wave receivers","mixers (circuits)","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["64-QAM CMOS transmitter","frequency band","tripler-based subharmonic mixer","cubic mixer","per-channel data rate","32 QAM","interference","image signals","second intermediate frequency signal","LO frequencies","IF amplifier","frequency 300 GHz","frequency 100 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS transmitter","cubic mixer","image reduction","THz","QAM"]}],"abstract":"A 300-GHz CMOS transmitter that covers the vast unallocated frequency band above 275 GHz with six channels has recently been reported.

The amplifier is designed to operate over a wide range of drain bias voltages and input power levels, making the stability analysis particularly important. Using the applied analysis techniques a stable amplifier design has been realized. The measurements show a maximum pulsed output power of 20 W at 30 V drain bias and a maximum PAE of 45% at 18V drain bias.

The presented single-transistor MMIC exhibits a small-signal gain of more than 9 dB at 38 GHz and delivers 269 mW (24.3 dBm) of output power at 38 GHz, which results in a power density of over 1.2 W/mm. The amplifier shows a drain efficiency of up to 33 % and a power-added efficiency (PAE) of up to 22 %.","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777551","startPage":"305","endPage":"308","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777551.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Q-band power amplifier MMIC using 100 nm AlGaN/GaN HEMT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Q-band power amplifier MMIC using 100 nm AlGaN/GaN HEMT","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777551/","accessionNumber":"16522886","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777551/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Q-band power amplifier MMIC using 100 nm AlGaN/GaN HEMT","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074587S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7777559,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Koziel","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Koziel","id":"37270222900"},{"name":"Adrian Bekasiewicz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bekasiewicz","id":"38233401400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-044-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9009-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777559","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777559","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Couplers","Algorithm design and analysis","Microwave circuits","Microwave communication","Microwave FET integrated circuits","Microwave integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip couplers","microwave circuits","optimisation","Pareto analysis","waveguide couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","microwave couplers","corrected domain patching","microwave components","microwave circuits","Pareto front representation","sequential domain patching technique","coarse-discretization EM simulation models","miniaturized microstrip rat-race coupler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer-aided design","microwave couplers","multi-objective optimization","domain patching","surrogate modeling","response correction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777559","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777559.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of microwave couplers using corrected domain patching","abstract":"Practical design of microwave components and circuits is a compromise between various, often conflicting objectives. In case of compact structures, the trade-offs are typically concerned with the circuit size and its electrical performance. Comprehensive information about the best possible trade-offs can be obtained by means of multi-objective optimization. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient technique for identifying a Pareto front representation for miniaturized microstrip couplers. We exploit a sequential domain patching technique that constructs a path between the extreme Pareto-optimal designs (found by single-objective optimization runs). This stage is executed using coarse-discretization EM simulation models. Selected non-dominated designs from the path are subsequently corrected in order to fulfill prescribed design constraints (in particular, equal power split at the operating frequency), and refined in order to obtain the final Pareto set representation at the level of high-fidelity EM simulation model of the structure at hand. The proposed technique is demonstrated using a miniaturized microstrip rat-race coupler.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777559/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16522823","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777559/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of microwave couplers using corrected domain patching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of microwave couplers using corrected domain patching","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064159S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7777564,"authors":[{"name":"Yolanda Jato","affiliation":["Dpto.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of broadband high power amplifier with excellent wideband DPD linearization and RF performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777606","publicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764428/7777458/07777606.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"523","doi":"10.1109/EuMIC.2016.7777606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 20W and broadband two-stage LDMOS power amplifier with high-Q Cu integrated passive device for multi-band and multi-standard applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A 20W and broadband two-stage LDMOS power amplifier with high-Q Cu integrated passive device for multi-band and multi-standard applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777606/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522861","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777606/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 20W and broadband two-stage LDMOS power amplifier with high-Q Cu integrated passive device for multi-band and multi-standard applications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040269S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764428","isNumber":"7777458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764428","xplore-issue":"7777458","articleId":"7777606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7777649,"authors":[{"name":"Rub\u00e9n San-Segundo","bio":{"p":["Rub\u00e9n San-Segundo (ruben.sansegundo@upm.es) received his M.S.E.E. degree from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid in 1997 and the Ph.D. degree from the same university in 2002 (with highest distinction).

All experiments have been done using a publicly available dataset named UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. The final results using HMMs obtain comparable results to other recognition methods. Some improvements have been obtained when considering a discriminative HMM training procedure.

From the outburst of Information and Communication Technologies, virtual and remote labs have added to hands-on labs a new conception of practical experience, especially in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education. This paper aims at describing the features of a remote lab named Virtual Instruments System in Reality, embedded in a community of practice and forming the spearhead of a federation of remote labs. More particularly, it discusses the advantages and disadvantages of remote labs over virtual labs as regards to scalability constraints and development and maintenance costs. Finally, it describes an actual implementation in an international community of practice of engineering schools forming the embryo of a first world wide federation of Virtual Instruments System in Reality nodes, under the framework of a project funded by the Erasmus+ Program.","doi":"10.1109/CISPEE.2016.7777722","publicationTitle":"2016 2nd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 2nd International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756177/7777713/07777722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISPEE.2016.7777722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777713","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spreading remote lab usage a system \u2014 A community \u2014 A Federation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spreading remote lab usage a system \u2014 A community \u2014 A Federation","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777722/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525353","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777722/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading remote lab usage a system \u2014 A community \u2014 A Federation","confLoc":"Vila Real, Portugal","sourcePdf":"CISPEE2016paper11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.192758S","chronDate":"20-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756177","isNumber":"7777713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756177","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7777713","articleId":"7777722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777747,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Shoushtari Moghaddam","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehran Shoushtari","lastName":"Moghaddam","id":"37086087370"},{"name":"Naser Movahhedinia","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Naser","lastName":"Movahhedinia","id":"37347714300"},{"name":"Mohammad-Reza Khayyambashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad-Reza","lastName":"Khayyambashi","id":"37391714400"},{"name":"Faramarz Hendessi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Faramarz","lastName":"Hendessi","id":"37303018800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4335-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4336-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777747","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Computer architecture","Cognitive radio","Microprocessors","Mobile radio mobility management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","IP networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","next generation networks","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","spectrum mobility","multi-homed mobile IPv6 cognitive radio cellular networks","VLSI","mobile devices","multihoming","wireless access technologies","next generation wireless networks","NGWN","spectrum handover","mobility management protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","handover latency","Mobile IPv6","multi-homing","spectrum handover"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777747","doi":"10.1109/IKT.2016.7777747","publicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","abstract":"Technological developments alongside VLSI achievements enable mobile devices to be equipped with multiple radio interfaces which is known as multihoming.

Service-oriented computing is an attractive platform for most users to execute these applications in a pay-as-you-go manner. Therefore, scheduling workflows on the cloud as the latest trend in service-oriented computing and meeting the required users' Quality of Service requirements is an important problem to be tackled. Furthermore, the scheduling algorithms must consider the available multicore processing resources on the commercial Infrastructure as a Service cloud. Hence, considering multicore resources in addition to Quality of Service constraints makes the workflow scheduling problem more challenging to be solved. In this research, a static workflow scheduling algorithm is proposed which considers the available multicore resources on the cloud and attempts to minimize the leasing costs of the processing resources while considering not violating a user-defined deadline. The proposed algorithm uses a clustering technique to divide the workflow into a number of clusters and attempts to combine the clusters in such a way to achieve the algorithms' main goals. A flexible and extendable scoring approach chooses the best combination available in each step. Extensive simulations reveal a great reduction in the leasing costs of the workflow execution while meeting the user-defined deadline.","doi":"10.1109/IKT.2016.7777750","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763638/7777746/07777750.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IKT.2016.7777750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777746","publicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A clustering approach to schedule workflows to run on the cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777750/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16525496","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clustering approach to schedule workflows to run on the cloud","confLoc":"Hamedan, Iran","sourcePdf":"125122127clusteringdeldari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069188S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763638","isNumber":"7777746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763638","xplore-issue":"7777746","articleId":"7777750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7777757,"authors":[{"name":"Rasoul Seidipiri","affiliation":["Bourojerd Branch, Islamic Azad university, Bourojerd, Iran"],"firstName":"Rasoul","lastName":"Seidipiri","id":"37086064236"},{"name":"Ahmad Patooghy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science & Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Patooghy","id":"37540803700"},{"name":"Sima Afsharpour","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sima","lastName":"Afsharpour","id":"37086063886"},{"name":"Mahdi Fazeli","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science & Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Fazeli","id":"37294435000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4335-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4336-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777757","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"This paper proposes and evaluates a performance efficient application mapping algorithm for mesh-based NoCs.

Then a task with the most communication traffic is selected and mapped onto the center part of the mesh topology i.e., a core with the most available communication channels. After that, repeatedly, the next task is selected in a way that has the most communications with the already mapped tasks. Such a task is mapped onto the core which its degree is proportional to the tasks link degree. The proposed method is evaluated by Noxim which is a cycle-accurate NoC simulator in terms of communication cost i.e., to total number of packets traversed through the network to complete the application graph. The proposed method is compared with several previously proposed mapping algorithms including NMAP, CMAP, LMAP, PSMAP, and CASTNET. Comparisons show that the proposed method offers better performance and consumes lower energy in the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763638/7777746/07777757.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"155","publicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","doi":"10.1109/IKT.2016.7777757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IKT.2016.7777757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RASMAP: An efficient heuristic application mapping algorithm for network-on-chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Network topology","Topology","Heuristic algorithms","Reliability","Delays","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RASMAP algorithm","heuristic application mapping algorithm","network-on-chips","mesh-based NoC","application graph","total in-out communication traffic","mesh topology","cycle-accurate NoC simulator","communication cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mapping","NoC","mesh","multi-core","task"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"RASMAP: An efficient heuristic application mapping algorithm for network-on-chips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525480","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RASMAP: An efficient heuristic application mapping algorithm for network-on-chips","confLoc":"Hamedan, Iran","sourcePdf":"155149155rasmapseidipiri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062517S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763638","isNumber":"7777746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763638","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7777746","articleId":"7777757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777760,"authors":[{"name":"Mir Hossein Dezfoulian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mir Hossein","lastName":"Dezfoulian","id":"37990995600"},{"name":"Younes MiriNezhad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran"],"firstName":"Younes","lastName":"MiriNezhad","id":"37086061575"},{"name":"Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Muhammad Hossein","lastName":"Mousavi","id":"37086066651"},{"name":"Mehrdad Shafaei Mosleh","affiliation":["Bu Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Hamedan, IR"],"firstName":"Mehrdad Shafaei","lastName":"Mosleh","id":"37086358288"},{"name":"Muhammad Mehdi Shalchi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bu Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran"],"firstName":"Muhammad Mehdi","lastName":"Shalchi","id":"37086065289"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4335-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4336-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777760","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777760","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Support vector machines","Runtime","Databases","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ho-Kashyap classification algorithm","learning samples","supervised classification algorithms","multiclass instance selection method","MCIS method","data classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Component","Classification","Ho-Kashyap","MCIS"]}],"abstract":"This article is focusing on optimization of the Ho-Kashyap classification algorithm.

This kind of marketing generates a numerous transaction and data which are potentially valuable. Using data mining is an alternative to discover frequent patterns and association rules from datasets. In this paper, we use data mining techniques for discovering frequent customers' buying patterns from a Customer Relationship Management database. There are lots of algorithms for this purpose, such as Apriori and FP-Growth. However, they may not have efficient performance when the data is big, therefore various meta-heuristic methods can be an alternative.

We apply LSTM and deep LSTM on FARSDAT speech database and find that both LSTM and deep LSTM outperforms HMM in Persian phoneme recognition. Our evaluation show that deep LSTM achieves 17.55% error in FARSDAT phoneme recognition on test set which to our knowledge is the best recorded result.","doi":"10.1109/IKT.2016.7777777","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763638/7777746/07777777.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Eighth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IKT.2016.7777777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Persian phoneme recognition using long short-term memory neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Neural networks","Logic gates","Error analysis","Databases","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","recurrent neural nets","signal classification","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Persian phoneme recognition","long short-term memory neural network","recurrent neural network","RNN","LSTM","sequence classification tasks","hidden Markov model","HMM","FARSDAT speech database","FARSDAT phoneme recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)","Farsdat","Persian Speech Recognition","Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Persian phoneme recognition using long short-term memory neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525492","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Persian phoneme recognition using long short-term memory neural network","confLoc":"Hamedan, Iran","sourcePdf":"240111115PersianDaneshvar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045944S","chronDate":"7-8 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763638","isNumber":"7777746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763638","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7777746","articleId":"7777777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777801,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Akhoundi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farhad","lastName":"Akhoundi","id":"37085365438"},{"name":"Saeed Sharifi-Malvajerdi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Sharifi-Malvajerdi","id":"37085999571"},{"name":"Omid Poursaeed","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Poursaeed","id":"37085521685"},{"name":"Jawad A.

In particular, given pre-existing communications in the spectrum where the system is operating, a channel sensing and estimation method is used to obtain information of subcarrier availability. Given this information, some real-valued multi-level orthogonal codes, which are orthogonal codes with values of {\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14,...}, are provided for emerging new users, i.e., cognitive radio users. Additionally, we have obtained a closed form expression for bit error rate of cognitive radio receivers in terms of detection probability of primary users, CR users' sensing time and CR users' signal to noise ratio. Moreover, simulation results obtained in this paper indicate the precision with which the analytical results have been obtained in modeling the aforementioned system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical studies of fragmented-spectrum multi-level OFDM-CDMA technique in cognitive radio networks","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","doi":"10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777801","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763653/7777798/07777801.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777798","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analytical studies of fragmented-spectrum multi-level OFDM-CDMA technique in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777801/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525605","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical studies of fragmented-spectrum multi-level OFDM-CDMA technique in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570280460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086019S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777803,"authors":[{"name":"Nazimuddin Sheikh","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Institute of Engineering & Management, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Nazimuddin","lastName":"Sheikh","id":"37086063199"},{"name":"Kanyasree Mustafi","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Institute of Engineering & Management, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Kanyasree","lastName":"Mustafi","id":"37086063660"},{"name":"Indraneel Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Institute of Engineering & Management, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Indraneel","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"38232196600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1496-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1497-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777803","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Intrusion detection","Pattern matching","Indexes","Classification algorithms","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","DNA","Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["innovative string searching algorithm","DNA sequence","Internet","intrusion detection and prevention system","exact-pattern searching algorithms","KDD Cup dataset","global nucleotide sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["String searching algorithm","pattern","time and space complexity","intrusion detection and prevention system","signature","DNA sequence","false alarm"]}],"abstract":"The security related issues in the Internet have drawn a constant attention due to rapid growth of attack and its devastating consequence.

It has different characteristics like virtualization, multi-user, scalability and many more. It also provides on demand computational infrastructure which has the power to reduce the cost to build the IT based services. It can provide deferent types of service over the internet. One of the important services is provided by the cloud is storage where users can keep their data as per the requirement. So, it is a challenging issue for the user, as all the data are stored in some inter-connected resource pool but this resource pool are situated over different places of the world. An unauthorized users may be accessed this data through virtual machines. So, it is a very dark side of cloud data storage, this insecurity creates a big problem for users. Therefore cloud computing data security is a major problem. In order to solve the data security in cloud computing, we have proposed a new framework and an Encryption Schemes which encrypt the data and retrieve the data efficiently.

In these networks, secondary users are allowed to use the primary user channel with the condition that they cause no interference to it. Interference power received at the primary user is impacted by a number of parameters, including nodes transmit powers, distance between the primary user and the other nodes, path loss, and shadowing. A number of techniques have been proposed to model the interference power. However, these techniques do not consider the uncertainty associated with these parameters. Therefore, a model that deals with the uncertainty affecting the aggregate interference power is needed. In this paper, a Bayesian model is proposed to probabilistically describe how a number of factors affect the aggregate power of interference.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16525521","htmlLink":"/document/7777828/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian model of the aggregate interference power in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian model of the aggregate interference power in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089666S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777829,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Riahi Manesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen Riahi","lastName":"Manesh","id":"37086066942"},{"name":"Md.

Currently, radio spectrum channels are assigned for quite long time periods to licensed subscribers who may not constantly use these bands, which leads to an inefficient use of the radio spectrum. The concept of cognitive radio technology was suggested to deal with the problem of spectrum scarcity caused by the underutilization of the radio spectrum. A cognitive radio system is able to sense its functional and geographical surrounding and adjust its operation. Therefore, cognitive radio operation has to be considered with intelligent sensing and smart decision-making methods. The aim of the paper is to examine and evaluate the three most fundamental spectrum sensing techniques i.e. energy detection-based, autocorrelation-based, and matched filter-based sensing. Simulation platforms were developed for each of the approaches using GNU radio and Python language.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777829/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16525523","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777829/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089805S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7777839,"authors":[{"name":"Khin Thida San","affiliation":["UTAC, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang City, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea)"],"firstName":"Khin Thida","lastName":"San","id":"37085853016"},{"name":"Eun Young Lee","affiliation":["UTAC, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang City, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea)"],"firstName":"Eun Young","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086135077"},{"name":"Yoon Seok Chang","affiliation":["UTAC, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang City, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea)"],"firstName":"Yoon Seok","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292168700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1496-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1497-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777839","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777839","abstract":"This paper describes the implementation steps used to assign a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tasked to effectively deliver items to target locations.

The idea of \u201clogic implication\u201d is combined with an analog technique of using current mirrors to perform logic operations. By using current mirrors, the problem of limited fan-out of logic implication can be overcome, enabling more parallel operations to run together. The delay for even an XOR operation can be reduced to 1 cycle, compared to the 5 cycles taken by logic implication. The design of a full adder, ripple carry adder and array multiplier are described.

The Compressive Sensing (CS) approach has recently been shown to have a potential for indoor positioning systems (IPSs) solution once the positioning problem is modeled into a sparse signal recovery one. Indeed, positioning schemes using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprint maps and CS methods show remarkable improvements in performance. In this paper, we are presenting the impact of the Access Points (APs) selection scheme on the performance of both CS and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) RSSI-based IPSs methods. The performance analysis has been investigated using three different APs selection schemes, namely, the Probability of Detection (POD), the Time Variance, and the Random selection schemes. Our simulation results show that the Random APs selection scheme outperforms POD and the Time Variance schemes when CS-based framework is used while k-NN outperforms CS with POD and Time Variance schemes. Results also show that CS outperforms the k-NN method under the same number of selected APs when using the Random APs selection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763653/7777798/07777849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","doi":"10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777798","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of APs selection scheme on compressive sensing-fingerprinting based IPS performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Fingerprint recognition","Compressed sensing","Sparse matrices","Mathematical model","Received signal strength indicator","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","indoor radio","probability","RSSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor positioning systems","compressive sensing approach","sparse signal recovery one","received signal strength indicator fingerprint maps","RSSI fingerprint maps","access points selection scheme","k-Nearest Neighbor RSSI-based IPSs methods","k-NN RSSI-based IPSs methods","probability of detection","POD","time variance","random selection schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor Positioning","Fingerprinting","Compressive Sensing","Access Point Selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Impact of APs selection scheme on compressive sensing-fingerprinting based IPS performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525557","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of APs selection scheme on compressive sensing-fingerprinting based IPS performance","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075778S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777850,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Alhumaidi Alotaibi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Abdullah Alhumaidi","lastName":"Alotaibi","id":"37086139620"},{"name":"Marios C.

This deployment plan is applied in two steps. Firstly, predicting the number of required FAPs which relies on measuring the required area and calculating the FAP radios in the target area's environment. Secondly, deciding on the location to install FAPs which relies on locating the absence of received power from a macrocell and then the weakest received power from each FAP to the next. Mina neighbourhood in Makkah in Saudi Arabia is used as a case study because it suffers from poor coverage either because of the mountain terrain surrounding it or the large number of people during a pilgrimage time. Providing coverage and an enhanced quality of service requires several measurements, including signal strength, coverage area and outage probability.","doi":"10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777850","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763653/7777798/07777850.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless femtocell coverage on the go: A case in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777850/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless femtocell coverage on the go: A case in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525622","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777850/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless femtocell coverage on the go: A case in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064485S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777851,"authors":[{"name":"Fatima Salahdine","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, USA","STRS Laboratory, National Institute of Posts and Telecommunication, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Fatima","lastName":"Salahdine","id":"37085611183"},{"name":"Naima Kaabouch","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, USA"],"firstName":"Naima","lastName":"Kaabouch","id":"37586567500"},{"name":"Hassan El Ghazi","affiliation":["STRS Laboratory, National Institute of Posts and Telecommunication, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hassan El","lastName":"Ghazi","id":"37946062700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1496-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1497-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777851","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"abstract":"For wideband spectrum sensing, compressive sensing has been proposed as a solution to speed up the high dimensional signals sensing and reduce the computational complexity.

signals in cognitive radio systems using an evolutionary algorithm based adaptive filter","abstract":"Noise originating from several sources in a RF environment degrades the performance of communication systems. In wideband systems, such as cognitive radios, noise at the receiver can also originate from non-linearity present in the RF front end, time-varying thermal noise within the receiver radio system, and noise from adjacent network nodes. Several denoising techniques have been proposed for cognitive radios, some of which are applied during spectrum sensing and others to received noisy signals. Examples of these techniques include least mean square (LMS) and its variants. However, these algorithms have low performance with non-linear signals and cannot locate the global optimum solution for noise cancellation. Therefore, application of global search optimization techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, is considered for noise cancellation. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LMS algorithms are implemented and their performances compared. Extensive simulations were performed where Gaussian and nonlinear random noise were added to the transmitted signals. The performance comparison was done using two metrics: bit error rate and mean square error. The results show that PSO outperforms LMS under both Gaussian and non-linear random noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777854/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16525580","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7777854/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Denoising signals in cognitive radio systems using an evolutionary algorithm based adaptive filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising signals in cognitive radio systems using an evolutionary algorithm based adaptive filter","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058437S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777858,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein A.

However, increasing the depth also increases the number of parameters, which makes convergence of back-propagation very slow and prone to overfitting. Convolutional networks with deep supervision (CNDS) add auxiliary branch to addresses the problem of slower convergence and overfitting. However, CNDS does not resolve the issue of degradation, which can be addressed by residual learning. In order to effectively train deep neural networks, in this paper, we propose Residual-CNDS network, which adds residual learning to CNDS. Residual connections are parameter free and add only negligible amount of computation, thereby it has very little impact over complexity of the network. Results of our experiments on very large-scale MIT Places 205 scene dataset support our hypothesis that adding the residual connections to the CNDS will enhance the accuracy of the network. Our experiments show that the proposed network improves upon other recently introduced state of the art networks both in terms of top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525512","htmlLink":"/document/7777858/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel CNN architecture with residual learning and deep supervision for large-scale scene image categorization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel CNN architecture with residual learning and deep supervision for large-scale scene image categorization","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057756S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777861,"authors":[{"name":"Amean Al Safi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Amean","lastName":"Al Safi","id":"37086116044"},{"name":"Bradley Bazuin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Bradley","lastName":"Bazuin","id":"37428048800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1496-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1497-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777861","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based implementation of BPSK and QPSK modulators using address reverse accumulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Binary phase shift keying","Table lookup","Generators","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","direct digital synthesis","field programmable gate arrays","frequency shift keying","hardware description languages","modulators","quadrature phase shift keying","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP builder tools","VHDL","very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language","frequency square wave clock","LUT","direct digital synthesizer","look up table","reverse addressing technique","BPSK modulator","binary PSK","quadrature phase shift keying","phase shift keying","frequency shift keying","digital modulators","amplitude shift keying","field programmable gate array","address reverse accumulators","QPSK modulators","BPSK modulators","FPGA based implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSK","BPSK","QPSK","FPGA","VHDL","SDR","Digital Modulators"]}],"abstract":"Implementation of digital modulators on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a research area that has received great attention recently. Most of the research has focused on the implementation of simple digital modulators on FPGAs such as Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), and Phase Shift Keying (PSK). This paper presented a novel method of implementing Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) along with Binary PSK (BPSK) using accumulators with a reverse addressing technique. The implementation of the BPSK modulator required two sinusoidal signals with 180-degree phase shift. The first signal was obtained using Look Up Table(LUT) based on Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) technique. The second signal was obtained by using the same LUT but after inverting the most significant bit of the accumulator to get the out of phase signal. For the QPSK modulator, four sinusoidal waves were needed. Using only one LUT, these waves were obtained. The first two wave were generated by using two accumulators working on the rising edge and the falling edge of a perfect twice frequency square wave clock which results in a 90-degree phase shift. The other waves were obtained from the same accumulators after reversing the most significant bit in each one. The implementation of the entire systems was done in the Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) without the help of Xilinx System Generator or DSP Builder tools as many papers did.","doi":"10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777861","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763653/7777798/07777861.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based implementation of BPSK and QPSK modulators using address reverse accumulators","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525533","htmlLink":"/document/7777861/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based implementation of BPSK and QPSK modulators using address reverse accumulators","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570307837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042948S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777891,"authors":[{"name":"JonPaul Canclini","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department"],"firstName":"JonPaul","lastName":"Canclini","id":"37086188411"},{"name":"James McMasters","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"McMasters","id":"37086191172"},{"name":"James Shey","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Shey","id":"37085844464"},{"name":"Owens Walker","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department"],"firstName":"Owens","lastName":"Walker","id":"38557421700"},{"name":"Ryan Rakvic","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Rakvic","id":"37295786400"},{"name":"Hau Ngo","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department"],"firstName":"Hau","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37086192135"},{"name":"Kevin D.

surveillance","abstract":"In this paper, we are presenting a data flow and fault management architecture, developed for an event driven wireless sensor network used in landslide surveillance. Our concept system collects landslide data using a dedicated wireless sensor network. The WSN was configured with tree architecture and contains one gateway, relay nodes, and multiple end nodes. The WSN components were distributed in an array configuration inside the surveyed area. Each WSN component acquired landslide data by means of measurement points mounted on sensing rods and placed in the earth at specific depths. Relay nodes use local data gathered from multiple end nodes to compute a local data trend and evaluate possible alerts. The gateway acquires data from the WSN, manages the data flow and analyzes the global evolution of data in order to issue alerts and warnings related to landslide activity. Also, it verifies the responses of all landslide sensors in order to ensure data consistency and fault management in the entire network. Our proposed data flow management scheme is centered on the possible events that could drive the change of network response time. These events are handled by assessing local and global data trends with respect to predefined markers of landslide data. Once a local or global event is confirmed it triggers the adjustment of system response. Dynamic landslide events require a fast system response in order to ensure precise surveillance. The concept integrates a fault tolerant architecture that uses diagnostic fault codes to ensure data consistency and a flexible data path for all end nodes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777892","doi":"10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777892","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763653/7777798/07777892.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777892/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized data flow management in event driven wireless sensor networks: A case study on landslide surveillance","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16525518","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777892/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized data flow management in event driven wireless sensor networks: A case study on landslide surveillance","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570308253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040884S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7777899,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shekaramiz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Information Dynamics Laboratory Utah State University"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shekaramiz","id":"37085570260"},{"name":"Todd K.

However, the prior researches did not consider the following assumptions. First, wireless access points (APs) can be separable from UAVs and carried by UAVs. UAVs do not need to keep flying, once APs are placed at right positions for connectivity. Second, UAVs' and APs' batteries can be replaceable and carried by UAVs. They do not need to wait at the energy-supplying station until their batteries are fully charged. The recent development of mechanical automation for UAVs has been making these assumptions realistic. In this paper, therefore, we propose a new design of wireless multihop networks formed by UAVs on the assumption that batteries and APs are replaceable and separable from UAVs and both are carried and placed to the right positions by the mechanical automation of UAVs. This paper also shows possible design options of the UAV-formed multihop networks and the comparison between them. The simulation results validate the feasibility of each design model.","doi":"10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777900","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7763653/7777798/07777900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777798","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless multihop networks formed by unmanned aerial vehicles with separable access points and replaceable batteries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless multihop networks formed by unmanned aerial vehicles with separable access points and replaceable batteries","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777900/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525530","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777900/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless multihop networks formed by unmanned aerial vehicles with separable access points and replaceable batteries","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1570308938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120399S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7763653","isNumber":"7777798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7763653","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7777798","articleId":"7777900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7777903,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojing Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Polytechnic, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086137393"},{"name":"Xuemei Li","affiliation":["Beijing Polytechnic, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086139067"},{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Polytechnic, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086140453"},{"name":"Ruoqiao Li","affiliation":["Information School Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruoqiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086134720"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1496-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1497-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7777903","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based color space conversion system design and implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777903","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Image color analysis","Streaming media","Clocks","Radiation detectors","Blanking","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image colour analysis","multimedia computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based color space conversion system","digital multimedia procession","VGA","color space conversion system","camera","YCbCr video data","RGB data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital video processing","FPGA","color space conversion","VGA","ping-pong storage"]}],"abstract":"Color space conversion is a basic and vital subject in digital multimedia procession.

The hub is the game leader, capable of punishing the deviating sensors by using its multiple antennas to block reception for a specified period of time. Sensor nodes are the followers, each seeking to choose a transmit power to independently maximize its utility, modeled as a weighted difference between its achievable goodput and the expense of transmission. At the same time, the hub seeks to force the nodes to communicate their packets at certain transmit powers that maximize the welfare of the WBAN. We demonstrate this setup enables the Stackelberg game to reach a unique subgame perfect equilibrium.

It does take advantages from the system characteristics. For example, higher data rate and user capacity, better multipath resolution [2] and resistance to jamming, low probability of interception, accurate timing and ranging, and more importantly, stronger ability to suppress interference and jamming. To airborne applications, such as air traffic control, the use of CDMA as an alternative is highly suggested [3]. The reasons to do so are as follows. First, radio systems are spectrum sensitive, especially to the airborne environments. Careful spectrum regulation is needed. Second, most of current systems available are narrowband. Adding new system to limited spectrum resources is very difficult. Third, CDMA is wideband in nature. The signal power is spread and hides below the white noise level. As a result, its interference to narrowband systems is marginal. Fourth, CDMA receivers [4] by proper design have the ability of suppressing narrowband interference and Multiple Access Interference (MAI). Fifth, adaptive filter algorithms can provide excellent tracking performance to airborne dynamics. Sixth, incorporating the use of antenna arrays [5] may further improve the performance to interference suppression and user capacity. In this paper, proposed is an adaptive DS-CDMA receiver with antenna arrays and blind adaptation. This receiver structure assumes the same amount of information as the conventional matched filter receiver, namely, the signature sequence and the synchronization information (the timing and the carrier phase) of the desired user. In reality, the signature sequence is usually available at the receiver, while the code timing [6] and the carrier phase have to be estimated. As a consequence, the development of reliable and efficient code acquisition algorithm to the proposed receiver structure is important.

To handle this problem, we propose in this paper an innovative routing algorithm called NoDe-TBR (Node Density-TBR), derived from Trajectory-Based Routing (TBR). In this routing algorithm, each aircraft computes a geographic path between itself and the destination of its message. In order to improve delivery probability, this path takes into account the actual aircraft density in each area. The performances of this algorithm have been assessed through simulations, with replayed aircraft trajectories over the North Atlantic Tracks (NATs). They are compared to the performances of classic routing algorithms designed for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs). Our solution exhibits better performances than classic routing protocols, but for a fraction of the signalization traffic volume. This is particularly desirable in resource-constraint networks such as AANETs.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2016.7777989","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756173/7777937/07777989.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2016.7777989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777937","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing in aeronautical ad-hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7777989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Routing in aeronautical ad-hoc networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7777989/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525221","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7777989/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing in aeronautical ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570263410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084234S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756173","isNumber":"7777937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756173","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7777937","articleId":"7777989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778029,"authors":[{"name":"Suraj Bijjahalli","affiliation":["School of Engineering-Aerospace and Aviation Discipline, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC"],"firstName":"Suraj","lastName":"Bijjahalli","id":"37086103380"},{"name":"Subramanian Ramasamy","affiliation":["School of Engineering-Aerospace and Aviation Discipline, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC"],"firstName":"Subramanian","lastName":"Ramasamy","id":"37085350995"},{"name":"Roberto Sabatini","affiliation":["School of Engineering-Aerospace and Aviation Discipline, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Sabatini","id":"37665651100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2523-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2524-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"7778029","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Receivers","Urban areas","Satellites","Satellite navigation systems","Satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic","aircraft antennas","autonomous aerial vehicles","path planning","satellite navigation","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath analysis","unmanned aerial vehicles","unmanned aircraft system navigation","UAS navigation","urban environments","global navigation satellite system","antenna masking","signal multipath effects","GNSS aircraft-based integrity augmentation system","ABIA system","signal propagation","reactive alerts","predictive alerts","urban environments","path-planning functionalities","UAS traffic management","UTM","urban canyons"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GNSS integrity","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Urban Environment","Masking","Multipath"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) navigation in urban environments using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) as a primary sensor is limited in terms of accuracy and integrity due to the presence of antenna masking and signal multipath effects.

Consequently, a new standard called L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (LDACS) is being developed for the air-ground communications component of the next generation ATM systems. Amongst the options being considered for LDACS, the LDACS type 1 (LDACS1) is the most superior and mature candidate and is likely to be the final choice for deployment. The presence of previously deployed and operational legacy systems in the L-band has led to stringent spectral mask specifications for LDACS1, to ensure there is no interference caused to the former. In this paper, we propose the design of a digital filter bank which can satisfy the LDACS1 spectral mask specifications while also achieving low complexity of implementation. Design of the proposed filter bank is based on the improved coefficient decimation method. With the help of a design example, we show that when compared with the discrete Fourier transform based filter bank, the proposed filter bank achieves 71.49% reduction in multiplication complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778041/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16525264","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778041/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of a low complexity filter bank satisfying LDACS1 spectral mask specifications for base-station receivers in air-ground communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a low complexity filter bank satisfying LDACS1 spectral mask specifications for base-station receivers in air-ground communications","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570255952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04552S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756173","isNumber":"7777937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756173","xplore-issue":"7777937","articleId":"7778041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778051,"authors":[{"name":"Yongxi Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongxi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086174358"},{"name":"Kaiquan Cai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiquan","lastName":"Cai","id":"37586165600"},{"name":"Su Yan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085608436"},{"name":"Yanwu Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanwu","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085620226"},{"name":"Yanbo Zhu","affiliation":["Aviation Data Communication Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37880171900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2523-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2524-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"7778051","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Trajectory","Optimization","Delays","Planning","Data models","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic","decision making","genetic algorithms","transportation","travel industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization model","Chinese airspace","flight plans","AirTOp","large-scale constrained optimization problem","limited flight conflicts","decision variables","4D trajectories","flight delay","airspace congestion","pretactical solution","NFTP","Chinese air transportation industry","improved genetic algorithm","China","network-wide flight trajectories planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-wide flight planning","4D Trajectory","Genetic Algorithm (GA)","Fast-time Simulation","Validation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778051","abstract":"With the rapid development of Chinese air transportation industry, air traffic becomes increasingly congested thus further worsen the delay problem. As an appealing countermeasure, the Network-wide Flight Trajectories Planning (NFTP) could provide a pre-tactical solution which reduces airspace congestion and flight delay by optimizing the 4D trajectories of all flights in the entire airspace. Notwithstanding, a typical NFTP problem could involve a large number of decision variables with high dimensions. In this paper, therefore, we formulate a single-objective 4D trajectories planning problem to minimize flight delay with limited flight conflicts. In addition, an improved Genetic Algorithm is proposed to handle the large-scale constrained optimization problem. To conquer the lack of realistic factors in the previous work, we present a systematic fast-time simulation and validation framework which is able to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed NFTP solution. Finally, we conduct the validation by a fast-time simulation software called AirTOp with real flight plans over Chinese airspace. The results show that the congestion and flight delay can be reduced in the real operation by the optimization model we proposed.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2016.7778051","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2016.7778051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777937","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756173/7777937/07778051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-wide flight trajectories planning in China using an improved genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778051/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network-wide flight trajectories planning in China using an improved genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778051/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16525227","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-wide flight trajectories planning in China using an improved genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570263371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075144S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756173","isNumber":"7777937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756173","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7777937","articleId":"7778051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7778069,"authors":[{"name":"No\u00e9 Monterrosa","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n e, Universidad Don Bosco, C.

Many solutions for UAVs flight controllers are based on embedded sequential systems. However, these systems are not perfect. The greater number of processes and tasks being executed simultaneously, the more variables such as precision, speed of response and synchronism may suffer. Our proposed flight controller solves this problem because it is based on a concurrent system and can therefore, execute many processes at the same time. The development of this flight controller represents just one part of the \u201cDrone Bosco\u201d project, where university students from Universidad Don Bosco are constructing the first UAV designed completely in El Salvador. The solution was designed and implemented taking into consideration specific characteristics of other areas of the project such as Radio Control Systems, Power Generation Systems and Aerodynamics. These considerations are outlined in this article. The flight controller is based on a state machine system that migrates from state to state depending on the stimulus received from sensors like accelerometers, tachometers, compass, pitot, GPS, etc. Another feature developed in this project is an emergency system that provides enough intelligence and robustness to secure the integrity of the aircraft in case a problem occurs during missions. Features like high speed of response, adaptable calibration and parallelism are achieved with our solution. Moreover, given that many parameters are generic, it has the flexibility to migrate to other fixed-wing UAVs with different characteristics. A similar approach could be applied in the future for the development of other devices that need navigation controllers with these characteristics, for example rockets or rovers. The results obtained in the simulations and tests of the flight controller system are described in detail in this article.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756173/7777937/07778069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2016.7778069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2016.7778069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, development and implementation of a UAV flight controller based on a state machine approach using a FPGA embedded system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Aircraft","Aerospace control","Field programmable gate arrays","Servomotors","Brushless motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV flight controller","state machine approach","FPGA embedded system","embedded sequential systems","Drone Bosco project","El Salvador","Universidad Don Bosco","UAV design","aircraft integrity security","fixed-wing UAV","navigation controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV","FPGA","VHDL","Embedded system","PWM","Top Down","fixed wing","Finite State Machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design, development and implementation of a UAV flight controller based on a state machine approach using a FPGA embedded system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525300","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, development and implementation of a UAV flight controller based on a state machine approach using a FPGA embedded system","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570261916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093172S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756173","isNumber":"7777937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756173","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7777937","articleId":"7778069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778070,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos C.

ATM challenges aviators and airspace controllers with unprecedented workloads to maintain safety and cross-checking of multi-source information, including data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The challenge for future ATM Decision-Support Systems (DSS) is not only autonomous and reliable complex decision-making with minimal human intervention but also dealing with UAV ATM (UTM). This paper proposes the implementation of Ontologies for NextGen Avionics Systems (ONAS) for UTM. ONAS presents an operation framework and an ontology-based tool to support decision making in advanced ATM/UTM systems. The proposed ONAS approach includes a cognitive ATM/UTM architecture for avionics analytics. An ontological database captures information related to weather, flights, and airspace. Inference over the ontology is provided by a reasoner. The decision-making process is underpinned by the concept of Situation AWareness (SAW) as well as Situation Assessment (SA). The SAW approach proposed is intended to be initially used in civil aviation. A case study is presented based on different scenarios for an ATM/UTM system. The scenarios represent flight situations where the decisions made are supported by the proposed ONAS approach.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2016.7778070","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756173/7777937/07778070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2016.7778070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ontological knowledge representation for avionics decision-making support","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Aerospace electronics","Surface acoustic waves","Decision making","Meteorology","Data models","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","decision support systems","ontologies (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SA concept","situation assessment concept","SAW concept","situation awareness concept","cognitive ATM-UTM architecture","ONAS system","ontologies for nextgen avionics systems","UAV","unmanned aerial vehicles","ATM decision support systems","DSS","decision making process","ATM","air traffic management","avionics decision-making support","ontological knowledge representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["knowledge representation","ontology","avionics analytics","decision-making support"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ontological knowledge representation for avionics decision-making support","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16540635","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778070/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778070/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ontological knowledge representation for avionics decision-making support","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570262498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073545S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756173","isNumber":"7777937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756173","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7777937","articleId":"7778070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778111,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Zeitler","affiliation":["Future Projects - Mission Systems, Airbus Defence and Space, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Zeitler","id":"37086002599"},{"name":"Thomas Hanti","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Hanti","id":"37085612198"},{"name":"Sebastian Hiergeist","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hiergeist","id":"37086004123"},{"name":"Andreas Schwierz","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Schwierz","id":"37086004927"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2523-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2524-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"7778111","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Human factors","Aircraft","Bandwidth","Hardware","Aerospace control","Logic gates","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","avionics","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication system","remotely piloted aerial system","air vehicles","automated systems","automatic take-off and-or landing","ATOL","waypoint flying","RPAS control","datalink system","RPAS technology demonstrator testbed","avionics hardware","flight safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["datalink","RPAS","autonomy","system architecture","fight control","gateway"]}],"abstract":"The move from a purely remotely piloted aerial system (RPAS) via air vehicles using automated systems up to a fully autonomous platform is a way that is being followed today. Using automatic take-off and/or landing (ATOL) or waypoint flying, the path towards more complex technologies for RPAS control is clear. Inserting such new technologies into an aerial platform requires extensive testing from an early project phase. Due to the complex nature of environment-related system inputs combined with highly complex algorithms, a pure ground testing will never be able to stimulate those new developments properly. At this point flying testbeds will be used as test vehicles for new equipment operating under real conditions. This paper describes the conceptional design and hardware realization of the datalink system of such a RPAS technology demonstrator testbed for autonomous concepts in the sub-150kg class. Designed light enough to respect certification limitations, this small scale RPAS shall be able to carry realistic avionics hardware undergoing testing in real environment for use as a cheap and flexible testbed. Driven by the concept of flight operations within a dedicated test range and pushed by flight safety a reliable communication system had to be designed to assure a secure conduction and surveillance of the flight, while still being able to interact with the experiments onboard.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2016.7778111","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/AIAA 35th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756173/7777937/07778111.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2016.7778111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A communication system approach for a small scale RPAS demonstrator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778111/","displayDocTitle":"A communication system approach for a small scale RPAS demonstrator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525230","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778111/","conferenceDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A communication system approach for a small scale RPAS demonstrator","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570262597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062006S","chronDate":"25-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756173","isNumber":"7777937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756173","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7777937","articleId":"7778111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778118,"authors":[{"name":"Han Sol Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han Sol","lastName":"Kim","id":"38240359400"},{"name":"Jin Bae Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Bae","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0002-8128-4708","id":"37281003900"},{"name":"Young Hoon Joo","affiliation":["Department of Control, Robot, and Systems Engineering, Kunsan National University, Gunsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Hoon","lastName":"Joo","id":"37288371200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"7778118","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":981},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Linear matrix inequalities","Stability criteria","Control systems","Lyapunov methods","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","feedback","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","matrix algebra","polynomials","robust control","sampled data systems","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach","newly developed time-dependent fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii","continuous-time state vectors","sum-of-square conditions","stability condition","sufficient condition","robust control technique","time-varying norm-bounded uncertainties","discrete-time state vectors","polynomial gain matrices","conventional fuzzy Lyapunov function","variable sampling rates","sampled-data polynomial fuzzy control systems","output-feedback exponential stabilization condition","polynomial fuzzy systems","sampled-data output-feedback stabilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponential stability","polynomial fuzzy system","sampled-data output-feedback control","sum-of-square-based stability condition","time-dependent fuzzy Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778118","abstract":"This paper presents an output-feedback exponential stabilization condition of sampled-data polynomial fuzzy control systems under variable sampling rates.

coils is indispensable against the occurrence of a normal zone due to frequently variable current operation and an enormous amount of stored energy. The co-wound conductive strips and Wheatstone bridges have been adopted in KSTAR to detect abnormal voltage signal caused from quench. Those voltage detection methods have sufficient capability to detect quench occurrence, but additional cancelling out of mutual induction by adjacent coils would improve stability and reliability of quench detection system. A new voltage detection concept, using central difference averaging (CDA) and mutual inductance compensation (MIK) simultaneously, as an advanced technique to compensate the mutual inductive voltage, has been suggested and studied for this study. The CDA and MIK methods were practically adapted to the KSTAR PF 1 coil for the feasibility study. Test results show that the inductance matrix calculated by the FEM tool should be revised because of a revealed discrepancy between measured CDA voltage and calculated MIK voltage. In this study, the inductance matrix was revised by using the \u201cGenetic algorithm\u201d optimization method to reduce the discrepancy between CDA and MIK effectively. The adoption of the MIK revised inductance matrix was consistent with CDA voltage; mutual inductive voltage was expected to be successfully eliminated.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2016.2637562","pdfPath":"/iel7/77/7753093/07778126.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2016.2637562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Quench Detection of the KSTAR PF Coils Using Numerical Compensation of Inductive Voltages With Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Study on Quench Detection of the KSTAR PF Coils Using Numerical Compensation of Inductive Voltages With Genetic Algorithm","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16648446","publicationDate":"June 2017","externalId":"4701205","htmlLink":"/document/7778126/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National R&D Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2015M1A7A1A02050725"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Quench Detection of the KSTAR PF Coils Using Numerical Compensation of Inductive Voltages With Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tasc-chu-2637562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061665S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"7753093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7753093","articleId":"7778126","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7778128,"authors":[{"name":"Xuebin Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8330723/7778128/xzhan-2637820-small.gif","p":["Xuebin Zhang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Communication Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China in 2012.

Nevertheless, the higher bit cost of flash memory is one major obstacle for the wide real-life deployment of flash-based video caching. This paper presents a set of design solutions to address this cost issue. First, we present a flash memory error tolerance design strategy customized for video data storage, which can enable the use of lower-cost less-reliable flash memory chips for video storage. The cost challenge can also be addressed by reducing the video storage footprint through on-the-fly transcoding. However, direct transcoding suffers from a high implementation cost. We propose two design techniques that can largely reduce the transcoding complexity at minimal storage overhead in flash memory. All the developed design solutions share the common feature of cohesively exploring the characteristics of video coding and flash memory device physics. Their effectiveness has been well demonstrated through experiments with 20-nm MLC NAND flash memory chips and extensive simulations with representative video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2637820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8330723/07778128.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2637820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing Low-Cost Flash Memory Based Video Caching in Content Delivery Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778128","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/76/8330723/7778128-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Realizing Low-Cost Flash Memory Based Video Caching in Content Delivery Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778128/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17681723","htmlLink":"/document/7778128/","volume":"28","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1405594 and 1406154"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Realizing Low-Cost Flash Memory Based Video Caching in Content Delivery Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhang-2637820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11804S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8330723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8330723","articleId":"7778128","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7778130,"authors":[{"name":"Pegah Kharazmi","affiliation":["Departments of Cancer Control Research and Integrative Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Pegah","lastName":"Kharazmi","orcid":"0000-0002-5997-6900","id":"38523767600"},{"name":"Mohammed I.

Detection and quantification of cutaneous blood vessels provide critical information toward lesion diagnosis and assessment. In this paper, a novel framework for detection and segmentation of cutaneous vasculature from dermoscopy images is presented and the further extracted vascular features are explored for skin cancer classification. Given a dermoscopy image, we segment vascular structures of the lesion by first decomposing the image using independent component analysis into melanin and hemoglobin components. This eliminates the effect of pigmentation on the visibility of blood vessels. Using k-means clustering, the hemoglobin component is then clustered into normal, pigmented, and erythema regions. Shape filters are then applied to the erythema cluster at different scales. A vessel mask is generated as a result of global thresholding. The segmentation sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 86% were achieved on a set of 500 000 manually segmented pixels provided by an expert. To further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, based on the segmentation results, we defined and extracted vascular features toward lesion diagnosis in basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Among a dataset of 659 lesions (299 BCC and 360 non-BCC), a set of 12 vascular features are extracted from the final vessel images of the lesions and fed into a random forest classifier. When compared with a few other state-of-art methods, the proposed method achieves the best performance of 96.5% in terms of area under the curve (AUC) in differentiating BCC from benign lesions using only the extracted vascular features.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Detection and Segmentation of Vascular Structures of Skin Lesions Seen in Dermoscopy, With an Application to Basal Cell Carcinoma Classification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2637342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8097350/07778130.pdf","startPage":"1675","endPage":"1684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2637342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8097350","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Automated Detection and Segmentation of Vascular Structures of Skin Lesions Seen in Dermoscopy, With an Application to Basal Cell Carcinoma Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7778130/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17358650","pubMedId":"27959832","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000024","fundingName":"Canadian Institutes of Health Research"},{"fundingName":"Skin Research and Training"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Detection and Segmentation of Vascular Structures of Skin Lesions Seen in Dermoscopy, With an Application to Basal Cell Carcinoma Classification","sourcePdf":"jbhi-kharazmi-2637342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075975S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8097350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8097350","articleId":"7778130","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7778134,"authors":[{"name":"Biyun Sheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex Systems of Engineering, Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8425815/7778134/sheng-2637379-small.gif","p":["Biyun Sheng received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

Although the regression-based framework has achieved great improvements for crowd counting, how to improve the discriminative power of image representation is still an open problem. Conventional holistic features used in crowd counting often fail to capture semantic attributes and spatial cues of the image. In this paper, we propose integrating semantic information into learning locality-aware feature (LAF) sets for accurate crowd counting. First, with the help of a convolutional neural network, the original pixel space is mapped onto a dense attribute feature map, where each dimension of the pixelwise feature indicates the probabilistic strength of a certain semantic class. Then, LAF built on the idea of spatial pyramids on neighboring patches is proposed to explore more spatial context and local information. Finally, the traditional vector of locally aggregated descriptor (VLAD) encoding method is extended to a more generalized form weighted-VLAD (W-VLAD) in which diverse coefficient weights are taken into consideration. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our presented method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8425815/07778134.pdf","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2637379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2637379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowd Counting via Weighted VLAD on a Dense Attribute Feature Map","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Feature extraction","Image representation","Encoding","Roads","Neural networks","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic strength","semantic class","spatial pyramids","vector of locally aggregated descriptor encoding method","generalized form weighted-VLAD","diverse coefficient weights","convolutional neural network","image representation","semantic information","learning locality-aware feature sets","local information","spatial context","pixelwise feature","accurate crowd counting","semantic attributes","conventional holistic features","dense attribute feature map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crowd counting","locality-aware feature (LAF)","semantic attributes","weighted vector of locally aggregated descriptor (W-VLAD) encoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Crowd Counting via Weighted VLAD on a Dense Attribute Feature Map","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7778134/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17990272","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473086 and 61375001"},{"fundingName":"open fund of the Key Laboratory of Measurement"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"MCCSE2013B01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140566 and BK20150470"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M561586"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowd Counting via Weighted VLAD on a Dense Attribute Feature Map","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-sun-2637379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101492S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8425815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8425815","articleId":"7778134","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7778136,"authors":[{"name":"Liao Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7862955/7778136/wu-2608999-small.gif","p":["Liao Wu received the M.S. degree in computer science and technology from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer application technology.

This dc-dc converter presents the main challenge in the implementation of the SST concept, given its operation at medium frequency together with the direct connection to medium voltage. This combination demands the utilization of dc-dc converter topologies that are able to operate in the soft-switching mode, whereby, given that typically insulated-gate bipolar transistor switches are used as power devices, zero-current switching modulation schemes become highly attractive and often mandatory in order to achieve the targeted efficiency goals. This paper describes in detail the analysis and design of a 166-kW/20-kHz dc-dc converter of the series-resonant type, which results to be particularly interesting for high-power applications, given its tight input-to-output transfer characteristics and its capability to ensure soft-switching transitions of all semiconductor devices. The main focus of this paper is to describe in detail the practical implementation of the aforementioned resonant dc-dc converter, where its main components, i.e., the medium- and low-voltage-side power bridges and the medium-frequency transformer, are described independently. The assembled prototype is presented together with the implemented testing strategy and the final experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07778139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","startPage":"7534","endPage":"7542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experimental Testing of a Resonant DC\u2013DC Converter for Solid-State Transformers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experimental Testing of a Resonant DC\u2013DC Converter for Solid-State Transformers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"16880351","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7778139/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experimental Testing of a Resonant DC\u2013DC Converter for Solid-State Transformers","sourcePdf":"tpel-ortiz-2637827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108495S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7778139","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7778142,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Andreu-Perez","affiliation":["Hamlyn Centre, Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8278217/7778142/perez-2637403-small.gif","p":["Javier Andreu-Perez (S'10\u2013M'13) received the M.Eng.\n degree in computer science and engineering from Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela University, Madrid, Spain, in 2007, the M.Sc.\n degree in software engineering from the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in\n intelligent systems from Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K., in 2012.","He is a Research Associate with the Hamlyn Centre, Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, U.K,\n where he is a member of the Machine Learning and Human Robot Interaction group.

GT2 FSs are applied to BMI for the first time in this study. We also account for several constraints commonly associated with BMI in real practice: 1) the maximum number of EEG channels is limited and fixed; 2) no possibility of performing repeated user training sessions; and 3) desirable use of unsupervised and low-complexity feature extraction methods. The novel online learning method presented in this paper consists of a self-adaptive GT2 FS that can autonomously self-adapt both its parameters and structure via creation, fusion, and scaling of the fuzzy system rules in an online BMI experiment with a real robot. The structure identification is based on an online GT2 Gath-Geva algorithm where every MI decoding class can be represented by multiple fuzzy rules (models), which are learnt in a continous (trial-by-trial) non-iterative basis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a detailed BMI experiment, in which 15 untrained users were able to accurately interface with a humanoid robot, in a single session, using signals from six EEG electrodes only.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17541866","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7778142/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Self-Adaptive Online Brain\u2013Machine Interface of a Humanoid Robot Through a General Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC-NIHR HTC Partnership Award","grantNumber":"(Project Reference: EP/N027132/1)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Adaptive Online Brain\u2013Machine Interface of a Humanoid Robot Through a General Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-andreuperez-2637403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160204S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8278217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8278217","articleId":"7778142","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7778143,"authors":[{"name":"Ai-ichiro Sasaki","affiliation":["NTT Device Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7874245/7778143/sasak-2636799-small.gif","p":["Ai-ichiro Sasaki (M\u201900) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1971.

With this method, the magnetic field can be amplified without increasing power consumption of the signal source. From an equivalent-circuit model composed of the floating and driving coils, we derived useful formulae for maximizing the magnetic-field amplitude at an arbitrary target frequency. The validity of the formulae was experimentally demonstrated. It was found that under specific conditions, the current induced in the floating coil can be increased by more than one order of magnitude compared to the current in the driving coil, leading to amplification of the magnetic field that reaches 22 dB at the target frequency of 10 MHz without increasing power consumption. We also found that the floating coil is effective in suppressing undesirable magnetic field components originating from common-mode currents. These results pave the way to further reduction of the power consumption in wireless communication schemes such as near field communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778143/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16723180","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Experimental Study of Magnetic-Field Amplification by a Double Coil","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Experimental Study of Magnetic-Field Amplification by a Double Coil","sourcePdf":"tie-sasaki-2636799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071113S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7874245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7874245","articleId":"7778143","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7778145,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajun Liang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7778145/liang-2636166-small.gif","p":["Jiajun Liang received the B.E. degree in electronic science and technique from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China, in 2012, and the M.E. degree in radio physics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2015.

By measuring the highest achievable overall data rate in the typical illumination scene, the performance of the multiplexing gain of the system is demonstrated.

In BF operation, the molten iron temperature as well as the Si content ([Si]), the phosphorus content ([P]), and the sulfur content ([S]) is the most essential quality (MIQ) indices. The measurement, modeling, and control of these indices have always been important issues in metallurgic engineering and automation. This paper proposes a novel data-driven nonlinear state-space modeling method for the prediction and control of multivariate MIQ indices by integrating hybrid modeling and control techniques together. First, to improve modeling efficiency, a data-driven hybrid method that combines canonical correlation analysis and correlation analysis is established to identify the most influential controllable variables as the modeling inputs from multitudinous factors. Then, a Hammerstein model for the prediction of MIQ indices is established using the Least squares support vector machine-based nonlinear subspace identification method. Such a model is further simplified by using piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial method. Compared with the original Hammerstein model, it has been shown that this simplified model can not only significantly reduce the computational complexity, but can also exhibit a good reliability and accuracy for a stable prediction of MIQ indices. In order to verify the practicability of the developed model, it is applied to the design of a genetic algorithm based nonlinear predictive controller for the multivariate MIQ indices by directly taking the established model as a predictor. Industrial experiments show the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778153/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17136340","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Nonlinear Subspace Modeling for Prediction and Control of Molten Iron Quality Indices in Blast Furnace Ironmaking","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61333007, 61473064, 61290323, 61290321 and 61621004"},{"fundingName":"Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N130108001"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08015"},{"fundingName":"Project on Scientific Research for the EDLN","grantNumber":"L20150186"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Nonlinear Subspace Modeling for Prediction and Control of Molten Iron Quality Indices in Blast Furnace Ironmaking","sourcePdf":"tcst-zhou-2631124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107498S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8002744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8002744","articleId":"7778153","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7778158,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jongwon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538752300"},{"name":"Kyounghoon Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Kyounghoon","lastName":"Yang","id":"37277420800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7778158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Gain","Microwave FET integrated circuits","Microwave integrated circuits","Pins","Microwave circuits","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","microwave amplifiers","microwave diodes","microwave integrated circuits","resonant tunnelling diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power amplifier","resonant tunneling diodes","RF power characteristic analysis","microwave amplifier","RTDs","IC","low dc-power consumption","maximum linear RF output power","gain hump phenomenon","negative differential resistance region","NDR region","positive differential resistance region","PDR gain","large-signal load-line analysis","harmonic balance simulation","power 0.42 mW","frequency 5.8 GHz","gain 8.6 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MMIC amplifiers","negative resistance circuits","resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778158","abstract":"This letter reports the analysis of RF power characteristics in a microwave amplifier using resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs).

The gain hump phenomenon is observed in an input power range from -32 dBm to -16 dBm, and is shown to arise from a sudden movement of the operating point from the negative differential resistance (NDR) region to the positive differential resistance (PDR) region, based on a large-signal load-line analysis together with a harmonic balance simulation.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2016.2629984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2016.2629984","startPage":"61","endPage":"63","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7809128/07778158.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF Power Analysis on 5.8 GHz Low-Power Amplifier Using Resonant Tunneling Diodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"RF Power Analysis on 5.8 GHz Low-Power Amplifier Using Resonant Tunneling Diodes","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778158/","accessionNumber":"16581551","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778158/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF Power Analysis on 5.8 GHz Low-Power Amplifier Using Resonant Tunneling Diodes","sourcePdf":"lmwc-lee-2629984-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053333S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7809128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7809128","articleId":"7778158","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7778172,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Mandloi","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, IIT Indore, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Mandloi","orcid":"0000-0002-3008-7042","id":"37085418618"},{"name":"Vimal Bhatia","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, IIT Indore, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Vimal","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37085366171"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7778172","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1886},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Jacobian matrices","Computational complexity","Uplink","Detection algorithms","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","iterative methods","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity near-optimal iterative sequential detection","uplink massive MIMO systems","uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","interference","computational complexity","polynomial expansion","dual band Newton iteration","Jacobi iteration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","matrix inversion","Neumann series","bit error rate","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"A novel low-complexity iterative sequential detection algorithm is proposed for near-optimal detection in uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output systems.

State-of-the-art double-integration approaches to extract these parameters from inertial sensor data are, however, limited in their clinical applicability due to the underlying assumptions. To overcome this, we present a method to translate the abstract information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis, this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of eight spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modeling approaches are compared: a combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modeling in the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in foot angle up to -0.15 \u00b1 6.09 cm, -0.09 \u00b1 4.22 cm and 0.13 \u00b1 3.78\u00b0 respectively. Stride, swing and stance time as well as heel and toe contact times are estimated up to \u00b10.07, \u00b10.05, \u00b10.07, \u00b10.07 and \u00b10.12 s respectively. This is comparable to and in parts outperforming or defining state of the art. Our results further indicate that the proposed change in the methodology could substitute assumption-driven double-integration methods and enable mobile assessment of spatio-temporal stride parameters in clinically critical situations as, e.g., in the case of spastic gait impairments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor-Based Gait Parameter Extraction With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2636456","startPage":"85","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2636456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7839252/07778173.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Sensor-Based Gait Parameter Extraction With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7778173/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638864","pubMedId":"28103196","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FAU Emerging Fields Initiative (EFIMoves)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor-Based Gait Parameter Extraction With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jbhi-hannink-2636456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094382S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7778173","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7778175,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhang Jiang","affiliation":["School of Digital Media, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7839251/7778175/jiang-2637405-small.gif","p":["Yizhang Jiang (M\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in light\n industry information technology and engineering from the School of Digital Media, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, in\n 2016.","He was a Research Assistant in the Computing Department, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, for almost two\n years.

In general, the construction of intelligent epileptic EEG recognition system involves two steps. First, an appropriate feature extraction method is applied to obtain representative features from the original raw EEG signals. Second, an effective intelligent model is trained based on the extracted features. However, there exist two major challenges in the process: 1) it is nontrivial to determine the appropriate feature extraction method to be used; 2) although many classical machine learning methods have been used for epileptic EEG recognition, most of them are \u201cblack box\u201d approaches and more interpretable methods are desirable. To address these two challenges, a new epileptic EEG recognition method based on a multiview learning framework and fuzzy system modeling is proposed. First, multiview EEG data are generated by employing different feature extraction methods to obtain the features from different views of the signals. Second, the classical Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is introduced as an easy-to-interpret recognition model to develop a multiview TSK-FS method, called MV-TSK-FS, to identify epileptic EEG signals. For the proposed MV-TSK-FS, the importance of each view, i.e., the importance of each feature extraction method, can be evaluated according to the weighting of each view, and consequently the final decision can be made based on the weighted outputs of different views. Experimental results indicate that the MV-TSK-FS is a promising method when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2637405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/7839251/07778175.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2637405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Epileptic EEG Signals Using a Novel Multiview TSK Fuzzy System","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7778175/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639109","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778175/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"G-UA3W"},{"fundingName":"UGC GRF","grantNumber":"PolyU 152039/14E"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800803"},{"fundingName":"R&D Frontier Grant of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BY2013015-02"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JUSRP51614A"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Outstanding Youth Fund","grantNumber":"BK20140001"},{"fundingName":"2016 Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20160187"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Epileptic EEG Signals Using a Novel Multiview TSK Fuzzy System","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-deng-2637405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204138S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7839251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"7839251","articleId":"7778175","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7778179,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Cai Liu","affiliation":["College of Transportation and Civil Engineering, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jia-Cai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085535420"},{"name":"Deng-Feng Li","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Deng-Feng","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1537-4315","id":"37402914800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"7778179","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Fuzzy sets","Uncertainty","Mathematical programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set","mathematical programming","multiattribute decision making","uncertainty","TOPSIS"]}],"abstract":"There are some mistakes in the computation results of the real example in the article by Li, \u201cTOPSIS-based nonlinear-programming methodology for multi-attribute decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets\u201d [\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">IEEE Trans.

In order to provide the best fusion effect, the operation point where UFIR meets Kalman is determined by applying probabilistic weights to each subfilter.

Development of high-quality compact models for devices is a key to connect device science with applications. One recent approach is to treat compact modeling as a regression problem in machine learning. The most common learning algorithm to develop compact models is the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. However, device compact models derived using the MLP neural networks often exhibit unphysical behavior, which is eliminated in the Pi-NN approach proposed in this paper, since the Pi-NN incorporates fundamental device physics. As a result, smooth, accurate, and computationally efficient device models can be learned from discrete data points by using Pi-NN. This paper sheds new light on the future of the neural network compact modeling.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6570653/7747664/7778193-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"2","accessionNumber":"16606865","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778193/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Physics-Inspired Neural Networks for Efficient Device Compact Modeling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for Low Energy Systems Technology, one of the six SRC STARnet Centers,"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007245","fundingName":"MARCO and DARPA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000084","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research EFRI 2-DARE","grantNumber":"1433490"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Physics-Inspired Neural Networks for Efficient Device Compact Modeling","sourcePdf":"jxcdc-xing-2636161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151095S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570653","isNumber":"7747664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570653","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7747664","articleId":"7778193","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7778200,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Lin","affiliation":["Center for Complex Systems, School of Mechano-electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7955029/7778200/lin-2631659-small.gif","p":["Xue Lin received the B.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from Suihua University, Suihua, China, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree in operational research and cybernetics from Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China, in 2013.

Different from the existing results, each agent of this system is controlled by switching control method. To achieve consensus in finite time for the switched MAS, two types of consensus protocols (the FTC protocol and the fixed-time consensus (FdTC) protocol) are proposed. By using algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov theory and matrix theory, it is proved that the FTC problem in strongly connected network and leader-following network can be solved, respectively. When the initial states of agents are not available, the FdTC protocol is applied to solve the FTC problem. Simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2631659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2631659","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7955029/07778200.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7955029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Time Consensus of Switched Multiagent Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Time Consensus of Switched Multiagent Systems","volume":"47","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16969231","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7778200/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61375120 and 61304160"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB160419"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2014JQ-5029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Time Consensus of Switched Multiagent Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmc-zheng-2631659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120181S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7955029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"7955029","articleId":"7778200","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7778203,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Rousset","affiliation":["Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, UCBL, CNRS 5220 INSERM U1206, CREATIS, Villeurbanne, Cedex, France","Dipartimento di Fisica, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/7847457/7778203/rouss-2637079-small.gif","p":["Florian Rousset (SM\u201916) received the M.Sc. degree in\n electronics and computer science from the engineering school, Contrat Premire Embauche, Lyon, France, in 2015, and the\n M.Sc. degree in signal and image processing from Universit\u00e9 Jean-Monnet, Saint-Etienne, France, also in 2015.\n He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in image processing, Institut national des sciences appliques de Lyon,\n Lyon, France, and in physics from Politecnico Di Milano, Milan, Italy, in a coagreement between the two institutions\n where his researches deal with single-pixel camera for biomedical a pplications."]},"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Rousset","id":"37085725245"},{"name":"Nicolas Ducros","affiliation":["Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, UCBL, CNRS 5220 INSERM U1206, CREATIS, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/7847457/7778203/ducro-2637079-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Ducros (M\u201912) received the M.S. degree in electrical\n engineering and biomedical engineering from Strasbourg University, Strasbourg, France, in 2006.

A single-pixel camera is an experimental setup able to measure the inner product of the scene under view-the image-with any user-defined pattern. Postprocessing a sequence of point measurements obtained with different patterns permits to recover spatial information, as it has been demonstrated by state-of-the-art approaches belonging to the compressed sensing framework. In this paper, a new framework for the choice of the patterns is proposed together with a simple and efficient image recovery scheme. Our goal is to overcome the computationally demanding \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization of the compressed sensing. We propose to choose patterns among a wavelet basis in an adaptive fashion, which essentially relies onto the prediction of the significant wavelet coefficients' location. More precisely, we adopt a multiresolution strategy that exploits the set of measurements acquired at coarse scales to predict the set of measurements to be performed at a finer scale. Prediction is based on a fast cubic interpolation in the image domain. A general formalism is given so that any kind of wavelets can be used, which enables one to adjust the wavelet to the type of images related to the desired application. Both simulated and experimental results demonstrate the ability of our technique to reconstruct biomedical images with improved quality compared with compressive-sensing-based recovery. Application to the real-time fluorescence imaging of biological tissues could benefit from the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2016.2637079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/7847457/07778203.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2016.2637079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847457","startPage":"36","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Basis Scan by Wavelet Prediction for Single-Pixel Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Basis Scan by Wavelet Prediction for Single-Pixel Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16652503","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7778203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001677","fundingName":"Institut Albert Bonniot INSERM","grantNumber":"U1209"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Basis Scan by Wavelet Prediction for Single-Pixel Imaging","sourcePdf":"tci-rousset-2637079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128301S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"7847457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7847457","articleId":"7778203","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7778207,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjit A.

millimeter-wave switch-type phase shifter (PS) is developed. The main idea is to introduce switches into the PS to align ILs of all phase states to the maximum, which hardly introduces additional phase variation, degrades IL flatness, or deteriorates maximum IL. A 60-GHz 360\u00b0 5-bit switch-type PS is designed with the proposed technique in a 65-nm CMOS technology. Measured results show that the IL variation among all 32 phase shifting states is within \u00b10.8 dB over 57-66 GHz, with a maximum root-mean-square (rms) phase error of 8\u00b0, a gain tuning range of 8 dB and an input 1-dB power compression point (IP-1dB) of 13 dBm. The proposed PS followed by a 60-GHz normal amplifier with invariable gain is also designed and verified. A maximum gain of 4 dB is achieved with a gain variation within \u00b11 dB over a 9-GHz bandwidth, an output 1-dB power compression point (OP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1dB</sub>\n) of 0.6 dBm, a maximum rms phase error of 11.3\u00b0, and a dc power consumption of 30 mW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17390395","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7778216/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 60-GHz 360\u00b0 5-Bit Phase Shifter With Constant IL Compensation Followed by a Normal Amplifier With \u00b11 dB Gain Variation and 0.6-dBm OP $_{\\mathrm{ -1dB}}$","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61204026 and 61331003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-GHz 360\u00b0 5-Bit Phase Shifter With Constant IL Compensation Followed by a Normal Amplifier With \u00b11 dB Gain Variation and 0.6-dBm OP $_{\\mathrm{ -1dB}}$","sourcePdf":"tcsii-zhang-2636335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092321S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8118325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8118325","articleId":"7778216","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7778217,"authors":[{"name":"Bowen Hua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bowen Hua (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

The ISO makes discriminatory side payments to incentivize the compliance of generators. Convex hull pricing is a uniform pricing scheme that minimizes these side payments. The Lagrangian dual problem of the unit commitment problem has been solved in the dual space to determine convex hull prices. However, this approach is computationally expensive. We propose a polynomially solvable primal formulation for the Lagrangian dual problem. This formulation explicitly describes for each generating unit the convex hull of its feasible set and the convex envelope of its cost function. We cast our formulation as a second-order cone program when the cost functions are quadratic, and a linear program when the cost functions are piecewise linear. A 96-period 76-unit transmission-constrained example is solved in less than 15 s on a personal computer.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2637718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8012582/07778217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2637718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8012582","startPage":"3814","endPage":"3823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convex Primal Formulation for Convex Hull Pricing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Convex Primal Formulation for Convex Hull Pricing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17121846","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7778217/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-10-1-0087 and HDTRA1-14-1-0021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convex Primal Formulation for Convex Hull Pricing","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-hua-2637718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101528S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8012582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8012582","articleId":"7778217","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7778219,"authors":[{"name":"Guanhua Qiao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7778219/qiao-2635878-small.gif","p":["Guanhua Qiao (S\u201916) is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

In order to make flexible deployment and management of massive small cells, the utilization of self-powered small cell base stations with energy harvesting (EH-SCBSs) is becoming a promising solution due to low-cost expenditure. However, the deployment of static EH-SCBSs entails several intractable challenges in terms of the randomness of renewable energy arrival and dynamics of traffic load with spatio-temporal fluctuation. To tackle these challenges, we develop a tractable framework of the location deployment and mobility management of EH-SCBSs with various traffic load distributions an environmental energy models. In this paper, the joint optimization problem for location deployment and mobile management is investigated for maximizing the total system utility of both users and network operators. Since the formulated problem is a NP-hard problem, we propose a low-complex algorithm that decouples the joint optimization into the location updating approach and the association matching approach. A suboptimal solution for the optimization problem can be guaranteed using the iteration of two stage approaches. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed schemes can efficiently solve the target problems while striking a better overall system utility, compared with other traditional deployment and management strategies.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07778219.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Deployment and Mobility Management of Energy Harvesting Small Cells in Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778219","topic":"Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778219/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Deployment and Mobility Management of Energy Harvesting Small Cells in Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16705821","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778219/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2014ZX03004-003"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Project CLIMBER","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2012-318939"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Deployment and Mobility Management of Energy Harvesting Small Cells in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-leng-2635878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10089S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G"],"articleId":"7778219","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7778222,"authors":[{"name":"Haesol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Automation and Systems Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Haesol","lastName":"Park","id":"37086244093"},{"name":"Kyoung Mu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Automation and Systems Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung Mu","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-7210-1036","id":"37407638800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7778222","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1336},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Cost function","Convolution","Neural networks","Neural networks","Benchmark testing","Stereo matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image patches matching","convolutional neural network module","CNN module","per-pixel pyramid-pooling layer","fattening effect","depth discontinuity","exposure difference","weak textures","Middlebury benchmark","illumination","learned matching cost function","conventional pooling layers","large-sized window","stereo matching cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network (CNN)","pooling","stereo matching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778222","abstract":"When a human matches two images, the viewer has a natural tendency to view the wide area around the target pixel to obtain clues of right correspondence. However, designing a matching cost function that works on a large window in the same way is difficult. The cost function is typically not intelligent enough to discard the information irrelevant to the target pixel, resulting in undesirable artifacts. In this letter, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module to learn a stereo matching cost with a large-sized window. Unlike conventional pooling layers with strides, the proposed per-pixel pyramid-pooling layer can cover a large area without a loss of resolution and detail. Therefore, the learned matching cost function can successfully utilize the information from a large area without introducing the fattening effect. The proposed method is robust despite the presence of weak textures, depth discontinuity, illumination, and exposure difference. The proposed method achieves near-peak performance on the Middlebury benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2637355","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing

680-nm/5.4-GHz vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with a two-stage injection-locked technique is proposed and demonstrated. Experimentally results show that a 5.4-GHz VCSEL with a two-stage injection-locked technique is effective for 56 Gb/s PAM4 LiFi transmissions. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first one to adopt a 680-nm VCSEL transmitter with two-stage injection-locked technique in a 56 Gb/s PAM4 LiFi transmission. A pair of doublet lenses is employed in the proposed PAM4 VCSEL-based LiFi transmissions to enhance the free-space link. The link performances of the proposed PAM4 LiFi transmissions have been analyzed in real time. Good bit error rate performance and three independent clear eye diagrams are obtained over a 20-m free-space link.

Hybrid damping that combines passive damping and active damping is an effective method to suppress HO-filter resonances. However, due to the high-order characteristic of the system, the tuning procedure for the parameters of hybrid damping is complicated. Hence, an equivalent circuit analysis method is proposed in this paper to accurately simplify the model of the HO-filter. Based on this, a systematic step-by-step design method for HO-filter-type grid-connected inverters with hybrid damping has been proposed. The passive losses, effects of equivalent series resistances (ESRs) and robustness against grid impedance variation have been studied. Compared with existing design procedures, the proposed method makes the hybrid damping more reliable by locating appropriate position for closed-loop resonant poles. Experimental results verify the proposed systematic design procedure.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637377","startPage":"4944","endPage":"4956","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8299601/07778225.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Design of the Hybrid Damping Method for Three-Phase Inverters With High-Order Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Design of the Hybrid Damping Method for Three-Phase Inverters With High-Order Filters","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2018","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778225/","accessionNumber":"17581602","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778225/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472154"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Design of the Hybrid Damping Method for Three-Phase Inverters With High-Order Filters","sourcePdf":"tpel-ye-2637377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099015S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8299601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8299601","articleId":"7778225","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7778232,"authors":[{"name":"Mark David Jenkins","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8207702/7778232/jenki-2631660-small.gif","p":["Mark David Jenkins received the B.Sc.

The primary contribution of this paper is the use of multiple bags of subspaces with which we aim to tackle the issue of appearance model update. The use of a multibag approach allows our algorithm to revert to a previously successful appearance model in the event that the primary model fails. The aim of this is to eliminate tracker drift by undoing updates to the model that lead to error accumulation and to redetect targets after periods of occlusion by removing the subspace updates carried out during the period of occlusion. We compare our algorithm with several state-of-the-art methods and test on a range of challenging, publicly available image sequences. Our findings indicate a significant robustness to drift and occlusion as a result of our multibag approach and results show that our algorithm competes well with current state-of-the-art algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778232/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17447050","pubMedId":"27959835","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Selective Sampling Importance Resampling Particle Filter Tracking With Multibag Subspace Restoration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Sampling Importance Resampling Particle Filter Tracking With Multibag Subspace Restoration","sourcePdf":"tcyb-jenkins-2631660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13214S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8207702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8207702","articleId":"7778232","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7778233,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva S.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and optimization problem formulation of a triple phase shift (TPS)-controlled inductive link based voltage fed-dual active bridge (VF-DAB) converter. Limitation on natural ZVS range for the TPS-controlled inductive link based VF-DAB is presented. To extend the ZVS range in a TPS-controlled VF-DAB converter, passive auxiliary inductors are connected in parallel (LLL tank) to the primary and secondary sides of the high-frequency transformer. Analysis and subsequent numerical solutions for the TPS-controlled VF-DAB with auxiliary inductors show complete ZVS of all the mosfets for the entire operating range. Experimental results confirm complete ZVS of all mosfets under various voltage gains and load conditions. A comparative loss breakdown for the TPS-controlled LLL tank VF-DAB and the conventional inductive link VF-DAB at various operating conditions show the necessity of the additional auxiliary inductors in the conventional design for increasing optimal switching frequency of the IBDC.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637506","startPage":"8035","endPage":"8053","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07778233.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Triple Phase Shift Control of an LLL Tank Based Bidirectional Dual Active Bridge Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Triple Phase Shift Control of an LLL Tank Based Bidirectional Dual Active Bridge Converter","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","volume":"32","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778233/","accessionNumber":"16880343","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778233/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Triple Phase Shift Control of an LLL Tank Based Bidirectional Dual Active Bridge Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-panda-2637506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108422S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7778233","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7778234,"authors":[{"name":"Narjes Davari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Narjes Davari received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, 2009.

To improve performance of the direct Kalman filter algorithm, this paper presents an asynchronous adaptive direct Kalman filter (AADKF) algorithm for underwater integrated navigation system. The designed navigation system is composed of a high-rate strapdown inertial navigation system along with low-rate auxiliary sensors with different sampling rates. The auxiliary sensors consist of a global positioning system (GPS), a Doppler velocity log (DVL), a depthmeter, and an inclinometer. Performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated using real measurements. The experimental results indicate the proposed AADKF algorithm outperforms asynchronous direct Kalman filter (ADKF) algorithm, i.e., the relative root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated position is reduced by 61% on average.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2637402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828062","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1068","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7828062/07778234.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Asynchronous Adaptive Direct Kalman Filter Algorithm to Improve Underwater Navigation System Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778234/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Asynchronous Adaptive Direct Kalman Filter Algorithm to Improve Underwater Navigation System Performance","publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16618354","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Asynchronous Adaptive Direct Kalman Filter Algorithm to Improve Underwater Navigation System Performance","sourcePdf":"jsen-gholami-2637402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084265S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7828062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7828062","articleId":"7778234","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7778235,"authors":[{"name":"Weicong Na","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada","School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7870723/7778235/na-2630059-small.gif","p":["Weicong Na (S\u201913) was born in Qiqihaer, Heilongjiang, China, in 1989.

For different modeling problems, the mapping structures can be different. In this paper, we propose a unified automated model generation algorithm that uses l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization to automatically determine the type and the topology of the mapping structure in a knowledge-based neural network model. By encompassing various types of mappings of the knowledge-based neural network model in the existing literature, we present a new unified model structure and derive new sensitivity formulas for the training of the unified model. The proposed l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n formulation of modeling can force some weights of the mapping neural networks to zeros while leaving other weights as nonzeros. We utilize this feature to allow l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization to automatically determine which mapping is necessary and which mapping is unnecessary. Using the proposed l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization method, the mapping structure can be determined to address different needs of different modeling problems. The structure of the final knowledge-based model can be flexible combinations of some or all of linear mapping, nonlinear mapping, input mapping, frequency mapping, and output mapping. In this way, the proposed algorithm is more systematic and can further speed up the knowledge-based modeling process than existing knowledge-based modeling algorithms. The proposed method is illustrated by three microwave filter modeling examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7870723/07778235.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2630059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2630059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7870723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Automated Parametric Modeling Algorithm Using Knowledge-Based Neural Network and ${l}_{1}$ Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Knowledge based systems","Data models","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Optimization","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","equivalent circuits","learning (artificial intelligence)","microwave filters","neural chips","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified automated parametric modeling algorithm","knowledge-based neural network modeling techniques","space-mapping concept","equivalent circuit models","electromagnetic data","mapping structure opology","unified automated model generation algorithm","l1 optimization method","linear mapping","nonlinear mapping","frequency mapping","input mapping","microwave filter modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design automation","electromagnetic (EM) modeling","knowledge-based neural network","microwave filter","parametric model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Automated Parametric Modeling Algorithm Using Knowledge-Based Neural Network and ${l}_{1}$ Optimization","volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7778235/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16721507","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN 122049-09 and STPGP447367-13"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Unified Automated Parametric Modeling Algorithm Using Knowledge-Based Neural Network and ${l}_{1}$ Optimization","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2630059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100369S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7870723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7870723","articleId":"7778235","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7778242,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Seek Choi","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Seek","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0003-1554-3879","id":"37985477400"},{"name":"Xisha Li","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xisha","lastName":"Li","id":"37086196252"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7778242","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":926},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Protocols","Computer architecture","Control systems","Scalability","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","software defined networking","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical distributed topology discovery protocol","software-defined networking","multidomain SDN networks","hierarchical path computation elements","PCE","abstract interdomain topology","intradomain confidential information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Path computation element (PCE)","hierarchical PCE architecture","proactive topology discovery protocol","reactive topology updating protocol"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a hierarchical distributed topology discovery protocol on the use of hierarchical path computation elements (PCEs) for orchestrating multi-domain software-defined networking.

According to the availability of the channel state information (CSI) and system state information (SSI), three scheduling schemes are investigated in terms of the system outage performance. Specifically, for the non-CSI case, we analyze the random scheduling scheme, which serves as a baseline for comparison. For the full CSI case, we propose the Max-Min scheduling scheme, which is theoretically proved to be sub-optimal in the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regime but optimal in the high SINR regime. To minimize the outage probability, we propose the optimal scheduling scheme, which involves the full SSI. In addition, the exact closed-form outage probability expressions corresponding to different schemes are derived under the general independent but not identically distributed channels. The residual self-interference incurred by the FD mode is taken into account. Moreover, independent and identically distributed channels are also considered as special cases. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical results. The results reveal that the Max-Min scheduling and optimal scheduling schemes significantly improve the outage performance compared with the random scheduling scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2637340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2637340","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07778253.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User Scheduling of the Full-Duplex Enabled Two-Way Relay Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User Scheduling of the Full-Duplex Enabled Two-Way Relay Systems","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668634","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7778253/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61531009"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen-Hong Kong Innovative Technology Cooperation Funding","grantNumber":"SGLH20131009154139588"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects","grantNumber":"2015ZX03001035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User Scheduling of the Full-Duplex Enabled Two-Way Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-xia-2637340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115332S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7778253","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7778255,"authors":[{"name":"Kae Won Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7820239/7778255/choi-2637320-small.gif","p":["Kae Won Choi (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree\n in civil, urban, and geosystem engineering in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and\n computer Science in 2003 and 2007, respectively, all from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.

The energy beamforming is a key technology to resolve a low energy transfer efficiency problem of the RF energy transfer system, which is mainly caused by a free-space path loss. The channel gains between transmit and receive antennas should be estimated to use the energy beamforming technique. We propose a received power-based channel estimation scheme that can be implemented by means of a simple power meter at a receiver. In the proposed scheme, the receiver measures the received power of the RF signal and sends a feedback containing the received power measurements to the transmitter. We formulate a channel estimation problem, which is recast into a linear estimation problem by using complex vectorization. Then, this linear estimation problem is solved by the ordinary least squares method and the Kalman filter-based algorithm. We also propose a method to reduce the dimension of the estimation problem when there are a smaller number of receive antennas than transmit antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2637320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2637320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7820239/07778255.pdf","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Received Power-Based Channel Estimation for Energy Beamforming in Multiple-Antenna RF Energy Transfer System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Received Power-Based Channel Estimation for Energy Beamforming in Multiple-Antenna RF Energy Transfer System","volume":"65","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778255/","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16598679","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778255/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Received Power-Based Channel Estimation for Energy Beamforming in Multiple-Antenna RF Energy Transfer System","sourcePdf":"tsp-kim-2637320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12136S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7820239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7820239","articleId":"7778255","onlineDate":"08 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7778265,"authors":[{"name":"Hossam Mosbah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, NS B3H 4R2, Halifax, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/7778259/7778265/mosba-2586939-small.gif","p":["Hossam Mosbah was born in Libya in 1984.

A new approach of multilayer neural networks is applied in composite topologies in order to improve forecasting accuracy. The intent is to study the behavior of diverse composite topologies to compare the best performance indices evaluated by the mean absolute percentage error and mean square error. The performance of different topologies is compared to identify the best connection architecture.

A residential neighborhood of the city of Toronto, Canada, is selected to perform the study based on survey results that showed a high tendency for EV adoption. The two most loaded distribution transformers of such a neighborhood are studied along with their cable feeders via steady-state simulations in CYME software. A worst case scenario of full EV penetration is studied, where all chargers are connected to the system simultaneously at the peak summer or winter load. The effect of increasing the rate of EV adoption on the performance of distribution networks is examined with correlation to the ambient temperature. Finally, the impact of increasing the charger size on system performance is explored. The results send a few warning signals of potential equipment overload to utility companies under certain system loading and EV charging levels as EV use grows, impacting utility future planning and operation. This will assist utilities in taking appropriate measures with respect to operating the existing system and also planning for the future.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2016.2545925","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/7778259/07778266.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2016.2545925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of EV Charger Load on Distribution Network Capacity: A Case Study in Toronto","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Fall  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fall  2016","displayDocTitle":"Impact of EV Charger Load on Distribution Network Capacity: A Case Study in Toronto","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Fall 2016","accessionNumber":"16524435","htmlLink":"/document/7778266/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tornoto Hydro-Electric System Ltd., and Hydro One Networks Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of EV Charger Load on Distribution Network Capacity: A Case Study in Toronto","sourcePdf":"cjece-awadallah-2545925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159804S","chronDate":"Fall  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"7778259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7778259","articleId":"7778266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7778301,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Jalalifar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/7778259/7778301/jalal-2593876-small.gif","p":["Majid Jalalifar (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the K.

The carrier is generated by a low phase noise LC-VCO, and then directly modulated by an NT-ASK modulator. The modulated signal is amplified by a class-E power amplifier and transmitted through an inductive coil. The transmitter achieves a total power consumption of 1.65 mW at 0.5 V, an energy efficiency of 16.5 pJ/b, and a phase noise of -115.7 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset at a center frequency of 2.4 GHz.

The AFM is a powerful tool to measure the topography of a sample at the scale of a few nanometers, where a small sharp tip supported in a micro cantilever scans the surface. In the contact mode the sample's topography is obtained by using the closed-loop control that holds the tip sample force constant. The nonlinear dynamics of the tip-sample system is very complex with different kinds of nonlinear forces that act between the tip and the sample. Here the dominated force depends on the distance tip-sample. In the present work we use a modified Hertz model to describe the nonlinear force when the distance tip-sample is less than 1 nm. First the complex nonlinear tip-sample system is controlled with a nonlinear MRAC of 1st order and after with a nonlinear MRAC of 2nd order. The results of both control strategies were compared in order to see which one gives a better control perfomance. Here a stability proof for both MRAC methods is present. A variety of simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. The procedure is general and can be applied to any nonlinear system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICA-ACCA.2016.7778435","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Automatica (ICA-ACCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Automatica (ICA-ACCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764431/7778382/07778435.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICA-ACCA.2016.7778435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the cantilever-sample system of an atomic force microscope","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the cantilever-sample system of an atomic force microscope","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525684","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778435/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the cantilever-sample system of an atomic force microscope","confLoc":"Curico, Chile","sourcePdf":"033IEEEICAACCA2016paper095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048247S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764431","isNumber":"7778382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764431","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7778382","articleId":"7778435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778445,"authors":[{"name":"Luis D.

In this paper new inverting Nx multilevel Boost converter (Inverting Nx MBC) with mode of operation and conversion ratio is discussed in detail. The proposed converter provides negative N time output voltage of the traditional boost converter. The main feature of this topology provides negative high-conversion ratio without using a transformer, continuous input current, moderate duty cycle operation and modularity. The proposed converter topologies are a combination of traditional boost converters and Cockcroft Walton (CW) multiplier. In this topology, each device block only one voltage level. Hence, low voltage devices may be used. The simulation results are provided which validates the functionality of proposed converter topology.","doi":"10.1109/ICA-ACCA.2016.7778453","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Automatica (ICA-ACCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Automatica (ICA-ACCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764431/7778382/07778453.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICA-ACCA.2016.7778453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778382","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-isolated and inverting Nx multilevel boost converter for photovoltaic DC link applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-isolated and inverting Nx multilevel boost converter for photovoltaic DC link applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778453/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525631","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778453/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-isolated and inverting Nx multilevel boost converter for photovoltaic DC link applications","confLoc":"Curico, Chile","sourcePdf":"051IEEEICAACCA2016paper066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082281S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764431","isNumber":"7778382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764431","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7778382","articleId":"7778453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778502,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis S\u00e1nchez","affiliation":["Mechatronics Engineering Department, Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas - ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador"],"bio":{"p":["Alexis Sanchez.

synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, the translational motion of a target introduces phase error in the echo data and its correction is an important issue. Besides, the rotational motion of strong maneuvering target also introduces time-variant Doppler modulation in short coherent processing interval (CPI) and is necessary to be compensated for well-focused imaging. In this paper, we focus on high-resolution ISAR imaging joint with translational and rotational motion compensation from data of compressed sampling. A chirp-Fourier dictionary is used to represent the maneuverability of rotational motion. Meanwhile, the translational phase error is treated as model error in ISAR imaging. Then, ISAR image formation is constructed by using a hierarchical statistical model to encode a sparsity prior and solved from sparse Bayesian learning, including sparse image reconstruction, parameter estimation and phase error correction. As a result, non-ambiguous imaging with accurate motion compensation can be achieved even by using the data of compressed sampling. Finally, experiments are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAR imaging and motion compensation with sparse Bayesian learning","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Radar Methods and Systems Workshop (RMSW)","doi":"10.1109/RMSW.2016.7778543","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Radar Methods and Systems Workshop (RMSW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764611/7778533/07778543.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RMSW.2016.7778543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"ISAR imaging and motion compensation with sparse Bayesian learning","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778543/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525822","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAR imaging and motion compensation with sparse Bayesian learning","confLoc":"Kiev, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"p02731Gouan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050341S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764611","isNumber":"7778533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764611","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7778533","articleId":"7778543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778569,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Unfortunately, such solutions are impractical from implementation point of view as they lead to an explosion of the number of firewall rules. In a related previous work, we proposed a new approach for performing assisted corrective actions, which in contrast to the-state-of-the-art family of radically disjunctive approaches, does not lead to a prohibitive increase of the configuration size. In this sense, we allow relaxation in the correction process by clearly distinguishing between constructive anomalies that can be tolerated and destructive anomalies that should be systematically fixed. However, a main disadvantage of the latter approach was its dependency on the guided input from the administrator which controversially introduces a new risk for human errors. In order to circumvent the latter disadvantage, we present in this paper a Firewall Policy Query Engine (FPQE) that renders the whole process of anomaly resolution a fully automated one and which does not require any human intervention. In this sense, instead of prompting the administrator for inserting the proper order corrective actions, FPQE executes those queries against a high level firewall policy. We have implemented the FPQE and the first results of integrating it with our legacy anomaly resolver are promising.","doi":"10.1109/NCA.2016.7778596","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764659/7778571/07778596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCA.2016.7778596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778571","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A security Policy Query Engine for fully automated resolution of anomalies in firewall configurations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A security Policy Query Engine for fully automated resolution of anomalies in firewall configurations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526384","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A security Policy Query Engine for fully automated resolution of anomalies in firewall configurations","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062354S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764659","isNumber":"7778571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764659","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7778571","articleId":"7778596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778635,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Natoli","affiliation":["NICTA/Data61-CSIRO, University of Sydney"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Natoli","id":"37086012621"},{"name":"Vincent Gramoli","affiliation":["NICTA/Data61-CSIRO, University of Sydney"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Gramoli","id":"37540967100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3216-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3217-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778635","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2111},"abstract":"Most popular blockchain solutions rely on proof-of-work to guarantee that participants reach consensus on a unique block per index of the chain. As consensus is impossible in the general case, it seems that these blockchain systems require messages are delivered fast and no participant mines faster than the crowd. To date, no experimental settings have however been proposed to demonstrate this hypothesis. In this paper, we identify conditions under which these blockchain systems fail to ensure consensus and present a reproducible execution on our Ethereum private chain. To this end, we introduce the Blockchain Anomaly, the impossibility for the blockchain to guarantee that a committed transaction is not abortable. This anomaly may translate into dramatic consequences for the user of proof-of-work blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like \u201cBob sends money to Carole after he received money from Alice\u201d impossible and may lead to double spending. We also explain how the anomaly differs from a 51-percent attack and how one could avoid it by adapting the Ethereum implementation or by exploiting smart contracts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Online banking","Contracts","Protocols","Cryptography","Transient analysis","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart contracts","Paxos anomaly","proof-of-work blockchains","blockchain systems","blockchain anomaly"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ethereum","Paxos anomaly","smart contract"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778635","doi":"10.1109/NCA.2016.7778635","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764659/7778571/07778635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCA.2016.7778635","startPage":"310","endPage":"317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778571","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Blockchain Anomaly","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Blockchain Anomaly","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778635/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 2 2016","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778635/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16540807","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Blockchain Anomaly","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064795S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764659","isNumber":"7778571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764659","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7778571","articleId":"7778635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7778653,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey W.

This leads to large latencies between the capture of image data and the time at which operators are able to make informed decisions using the results of a survey. As AUV endurance and reliability continue to improve, there is a greater need for real-time data processing to inform on-board adaptive mission planning. In this paper, we present an anomaly detection framework based on saliency and rarity and demonstrate it using existing side-scan sonar datasets collected by an AUV. Salient regions are first identified using a novel method with analogies to keypoint detection in traditional image processing. Models of these regions are then learned to determine rarity using an online approach for real-time use during a mission. The algorithm we present will be implemented in field trials later this year. This approach to adaptive mission planning enables an AUV to both resurvey anomalies at higher resolutions and selectively transmit imagery for operator analysis and feedback within the scope of a single deployment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764615/7778649/07778653.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV)","doi":"10.1109/AUV.2016.7778653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.2016.7778653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time anomaly detection in side-scan sonar imagery for adaptive AUV missions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sonar navigation","Sonar detection","Histograms","Real-time systems","Feature extraction","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","mobile robots","real-time systems","robot vision","sonar imaging","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operator analysis","image processing","adaptive mission planning","real-time data processing","AUV endurance","image data","data intensive","autonomous underwater vehicle operations","adaptive AUV missions","side scan sonar imagery","real-time anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["side-scan sonar","anomaly detection","autonomous underwater vehicle","adaptive mission planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real-time anomaly detection in side-scan sonar imagery for adaptive AUV missions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778653/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526162","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time anomaly detection in side-scan sonar imagery for adaptive AUV missions","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036931S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764615","isNumber":"7778649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764615","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7778649","articleId":"7778653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7778659,"authors":[{"name":"Erlend K.

The conventional manipulation is generally robot arm-based configuration which has singular points. On the other hand, the agent system is an armless manipulation that the agent vehicle works as the end-effector. If the location of the agent can be measured, the end effector is able to be place to any position. To implement this system, the method of an agent vehicle localization is proposed. The method uses the sonar images of moving agent obtained by forward-looking sonar. To detect the location of the agent in the sonar images, the convolutional neural network is applied. We applied the state-of-art object-detection algorithm to the agent vehicle system. The fast object-detection algorithm based on neural network can fulfil the real-time detection and show the remarkable validity. It means the underwater robot can begin navigation under its feed-back. Through field experiment, we confirm the proposed method can detect and track the agent in the successive sonar images.","doi":"10.1109/AUV.2016.7778702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.2016.7778702","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764615/7778649/07778702.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural network-based real-time ROV detection using forward-looking sonar image","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526200","htmlLink":"/document/7778702/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural network-based real-time ROV detection using forward-looking sonar image","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094323S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764615","isNumber":"7778649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764615","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7778649","articleId":"7778702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778722,"authors":[{"name":"Daiwei Li","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Daiwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086063310"},{"name":"Zheng Zeng","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085795231"},{"name":"Junliang Cao","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Junliang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085612008"},{"name":"Di Lu","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086062039"},{"name":"Chengke Xiong","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Chengke","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37086065972"},{"name":"Lian Lian","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Lian","id":"37414832500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2442-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5716-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2443-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6536"}],"articleNumber":"7778722","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propulsion","Turning","Robots","Vehicles","Gravity","Biomembranes","Hydraulic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","environmental monitoring (geophysics)","marine control","marine propulsion","mobile robots","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired underwater glider","aquatic environments long-duration monitoring","water column sampling","undulatory fin propulsion","surface swimming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underwater glider","undulatory fin","water column sampling","bio-inspired robot"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778722","abstract":"This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a bio-inspired underwater glider with undulatory fin, which is highly maneuverable and energy efficient and holds strong promise for long-duration monitoring of aquatic environments.

It is predicted that more and more sensor devices and computing resources will be deployed in access networks because of the Internet of Things (IoT). This movement can create a wide variety of new applications with different requirements of delay, privacy and locality. Smart community dictates less than 10ms communication as a control interval in order not to disturb the lifeline systems, such as power supply. As such, future devices should have the following attributes: low-power, low-latency, and flexibility for various applications. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware, low-latency, and flexible local device, such as gateway or coordinator, which integrates an SoC FPGA with dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) feature to grapple with data anonymization. The data anonymization is important to protect private information in smart community because domestic human activities can be, for example, estimated by exploiting electric power consumption data, which is known as nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM). However, anonymization operations usually require processing cost at the order of O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) where n denotes the number of data in a privacy processing window. In case of encapsulating privacy information in a local network, privacy preserving computation should be achieved in a local device. Hence, we have implemented four primitive operations using DPR for various anonymization purposes. The proposed system achieves 18-328 times better performance and 10-200 times lower power consumption in every primitive anonymization method than Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications

In addition, we consider updating keys to generate spreading codes at smart meters using a physical layer security scheme that is available when the AP is equipped with multiple antennas. We show that the probability of successful attack by an eavesdropper can be low by updating keys.

By using local generation from renewable energy resources, the stress on power generation and supply system can be significantly reduced during high demand periods. However, this also creates a significant challenge for conventional power plants that suddenly need to ramp up quickly when the renewable energy drops off. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption scheduling problem for prosumers to minimize the peak ramp of the system. The optimal schedule of prosumers can be obtained by solving the centralized optimization problem. However, due to the privacy concerns and the distributed topology of the power system, the centralized design is difficult to implement in practice. Therefore, we propose the distributed algorithms to efficiently solve the centralized problem using the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), in which each prosumer independently schedules its energy consumption profile. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence performance of the proposed algorithms as well as the capability of our model in reducing the peak ramp of the system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778757","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778757.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed algorithms for peak ramp minimization problem in smart grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed algorithms for peak ramp minimization problem in smart grid","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526277","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed algorithms for peak ramp minimization problem in smart grid","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p174-nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049578S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778759,"authors":[{"name":"Fengji Luo","affiliation":["School of Civil Engineering, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Fengji Luo (SM'09, M'13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in software engineering and computer science from the Chongqing University, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

A distribution grid is operated in a radial/tree-like structure, determined by switching on or off lines from an underling loopy graph. Due to the presence of limited real-time measurements, the critical problem of fast estimation of the radial grid structure is not straightforward. This paper presents a new learning algorithm that uses measurements only at the terminal or leaf nodes in the distribution grid to estimate its radial structure. The algorithm is based on results involving voltages of node triplets that arise due to the radial structure. The polynomial computational complexity of the algorithm is presented along with a detailed analysis of its working. The most significant contribution of the approach is that it is able to learn the structure in certain cases where available measurements are confined to only half of the nodes. This represents learning under minimum permissible observability. Performance of the proposed approach in learning structure is demonstrated by experiments on test radial distribution grids.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778762","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778762.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"211","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning topology of distribution grids using only terminal node measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning topology of distribution grids using only terminal node measurements","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526223","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning topology of distribution grids using only terminal node measurements","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p205-deka.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081228S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7778766,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9mi Bonnefoi","affiliation":["CentraleSup\u00e9lec/IETR, CentraleSup\u00e9lec Campus de Rennes, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Bonnefoi","id":"37085995967"},{"name":"Christophe Moy","affiliation":["CentraleSup\u00e9lec/IETR, CentraleSup\u00e9lec Campus de Rennes, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Moy","id":"37294411000"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["CentraleSup\u00e9lec/IETR, CentraleSup\u00e9lec Campus de Rennes, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37085675216"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4075-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4076-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778766","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","power engineering computing","smart meters","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT network","Internet of Things network","cellular network","AMI","primary wireless communication network","smart grid communication reliability","cognitive radio","advanced metering infrastructure backhaul reliability improvement"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced metering infrastructure backhaul reliability improvement with cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778766","startPage":"230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778766","abstract":"The monitoring of the smart distribution grid requires a reliable telecommunication system.

We show to which extent reliable information can be obtained for the test subject and investigate the influence of various parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16540704","htmlLink":"/document/7778781/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A diagnostic method for power line networks by channel estimation of PLC devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A diagnostic method for power line networks by channel estimation of PLC devices","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p320-lehmann.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074286S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778782,"authors":[{"name":"Deep Shrestha","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Deep","lastName":"Shrestha","id":"37543021800"},{"name":"Andrea Tonello","affiliation":["Institute of Networked Embedded Systems, Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t, Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Tonello","id":"37296217800"},{"name":"Xavier Mestre","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Mestre","id":"37284392300"},{"name":"Miquel Payar\u00f3","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miquel","lastName":"Payar\u00f3","id":"37294676000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4075-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4076-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778782","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Time-domain analysis","Frequency estimation","Frequency-domain analysis","Smart grids","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","carrier transmission on power lines","frequency-domain analysis","impulse noise","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","phase estimation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous interference cancellation","narrow band interference cancellation","impulsive noise","data transmission","power line communication","NBI cancellation","OFDM based PLC system","frequency domain","multiple signal characterization algorithm","MUSIC algorithm","minimum mean square error estimator","MMSE estimator","amplitude estimation","phase estimation","least square estimator","LS estimator","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulsive noise","LS estimator","MUSIC","MMSE","narrow band interference","power line communication"]}],"abstract":"The two major sources of disturbances for an efficient and reliable data transmission through power lines, known as power line communication (PLC), are impulsive noise (IN) and narrow band interference (NBI). In this paper, we propose an algorithm to cancel the IN and NBI simultaneously for an OFDM based PLC system. The proposed method exploits the duality of the problem, where the IN is sparse in the time domain and the NBI is sparse in the frequency domain. By virtue of this duality, we use multiple signal characterization (MUSIC) algorithm to estimate both the IN support (in time domain) and the frequency of NBI (in frequency domain). Furthermore, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is used to estimate the amplitude and phase of IN samples at the determined locations and the least square (LS) estimator is used to estimate the amplitude and phase of the NBI. Finally, the estimated IN and NBI are canceled out from the received signal, providing noise mitigated samples for demodulation. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified via numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous cancellation of narrow band interference and impulsive noise in PLC systems","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778782","startPage":"326","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778782.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous cancellation of narrow band interference and impulsive noise in PLC systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778782/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16540706","conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous cancellation of narrow band interference and impulsive noise in PLC systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p326-shrestha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080963S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778788,"authors":[{"name":"Jingbo Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering & Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

With larger scale and access of new energy, SGs become more vulnerable and unstable. Under this circumstance, unexpected line outages may cause more harm in SGs than in traditional power grids. Thus, accurate and fast localization of line outages is one of the major tasks and challenges in SGs. By exploiting the sparsity of line outages and phase information from phase measurement units (PMUs), compressive sensing (CS) has been introduced into line outage detection recently. In this paper, we propose a novel block-wise CS based multiple line outage detection scheme for SGs. First, by utilizing the sparsity of line outages and connection relation of the power grid, a new reactance model is derived, making the block-wise CS applicable. Then, we modify the traditional CS algorithm by redefining the selection criterion. The proposed scheme can achieve better precision as well as less complexity compared to the conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778788","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","startPage":"364","endPage":"369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple line outage detection for smart grid: A block-wise compressive sensing perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple line outage detection for smart grid: A block-wise compressive sensing perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778788/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526236","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778788/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple line outage detection for smart grid: A block-wise compressive sensing perspective","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p364-tan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108228S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778794,"authors":[{"name":"Charalampos Kalalas","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Charalampos","lastName":"Kalalas","id":"37085771686"},{"name":"Francisco Vazquez-Gallego","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Vazquez-Gallego","id":"37085487230"},{"name":"Jesus Alonso-Zarate","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Alonso-Zarate","id":"38271790400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4075-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4076-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778794","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Smart grids","Quality of service","Reliability","Substation automation","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","power distribution reliability","quality of service","smart power grids","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level simulator","RACH mechanism","random access channel mechanism","quality-of-service differentiation","power distribution network","information exchange","LTE network","smart grid distribution automation service","handling mission-critical communication","smart metering data exchange","human-type communication","background traffic","DA traffic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778794","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778794.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling mission-critical communication in smart grid distribution automation services through LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778794","abstract":"In this paper, a novel random access mechanism is introduced to enable the integration of smart grid distribution automation (DA) services in public LTE networks. The smart grid paradigm is anticipated to improve grid reliability through extensive and timely information exchange in the power distribution network. LTE appears as a promising communication technology for advanced distribution grid services since it supports extensive coverage, low latency, and quality-of-service differentiation. However, the standardized random access channel (RACH) mechanism of LTE has difficulties to meet the stringent requirements of such services in terms of access latency and reliability. This is the motivation for the contribution in this paper, where a representative DA scenario is considered and the achievable performance is evaluated on a system-level simulator. Extensive simulations of realistic overload scenarios demonstrate that our properly designed RACH mechanism can greatly improve the access performance of DA traffic with negligible impact on background traffic, i.e., human-type communication and smart metering data exchange.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16540703","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778794/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Handling mission-critical communication in smart grid distribution automation services through LTE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling mission-critical communication in smart grid distribution automation services through LTE","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p399-kalalas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038043S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778812,"authors":[{"name":"Hengzhao Tang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"lastName":"Hengzhao Tang","id":"37088146939"},{"name":"Wenhao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wenhao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086154891"},{"name":"Wibowo Hardjawana","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wibowo","lastName":"Hardjawana","id":"37392143300"},{"name":"Branka Vucetic","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Branka","lastName":"Vucetic","id":"37278594000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4075-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4076-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778812","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1045},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778812","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Smart grids","Modulation","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","Internet of Things","MIMO communication","modulation","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","5G Internet-of-Things networks","IoT terminals","cellular base station","smart grid","multiple-input-multiple-output","massive SM-MIMO detection schemes","spatial modulation","software defined radio","signal-interference-plus-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial Modulation","Massive MIMO","Internet of Things Transmissions"]}],"abstract":"The transmission from the IoT terminals to a cellular base station (BS) about the state of critical infrastructure such as Smart Grid requires high reliability and low latency. The combination of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (M-MIMO) and spatial modulation (SM) systems, referred to as massive SMMIMO systems, has been proposed in 5G cellular networks to support these transmissions. Building a practical massive SMMIMO system is very challenging due to the complexity and latency of BS detection schemes, often ignored in theoretical studies. In this paper we develop low-complexity low-latency massive SM-MIMO detection schemes that are validated in real wireless environment by using software defined radio (SDR) platforms.

This paper shows that the power grid topology can be approximately estimated simply by observing multiple power injection measurement data. We formulate the topology estimation problem as a blind convex optimization problem and solve using an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To evaluate the performance, eigenvalue analysis and centrality measures from the complex network theory are used. Experimental results using IEEE test system demonstrate that the estimated grid topology is very close to the original topology and exhibits almost similar patterns and

Two problem formulations described by mixed integer linear programming (MILP) are proposed. Under this framework, interactions between the next placed PMUs and earlier placed PMUs can be considered to be a set of inequality constraints. Effects such as zero injection buses (ZIBs), super zero injection buses (SZIBs), power measurement injections (PMIs), and line flow measurements (FMs) can also be accommodated. Both single stage placement and multi stage placement are studied with the consideration of the DOP.

Cost-effective retailing plans are recommended according to customer's electricity usage pattern. Usage pattern is recognized through classifying daily load profile (DLP) into a certain class, which is obtained in DLP clustering process. Two DLP clustering skills, plan rank-oriented and load feature-oriented clustering are investigated in this paper. Each DLP class is attributed to a typical plan rank, plans in which are more likely to supply good deal for DLPs in this class. Correlative features of DLP are evaluated in DLP classification phase, which enables recommendation accessible to customers with limited features information other than full load profile record. Promising results on plan recommendation for 60 residential customers demonstrate that the proposed strategy could supply effective recommendation to electricity users.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778838","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764633/7778724/07778838.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"673","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recommending electricity plans: A data-driven method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Recommending electricity plans: A data-driven method","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7778838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526304","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778838/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recommending electricity plans: A data-driven method","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p668-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095383S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764633","isNumber":"7778724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764633","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7778724","articleId":"7778838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7778868,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yang","affiliation":["National Defense Information Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086054508"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Wuhan Maritime Communication Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086052680"},{"name":"Mengsi Chen","affiliation":["National Defense Information Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Mengsi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086051507"},{"name":"Hualong Ma","affiliation":["Wuhan Maritime Communication Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hualong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086047816"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8515-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8514-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8513-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8516-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778868","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"In this paper we propose a compressive channel estimation for fast fading channel in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We formulate the sparse compressive sensing (CS) problem by exploiting the delay-Doppler sparse structure of the doubly dispersive channel. To combat the severe inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by the Doppler shift, this estimator is based on the banded matrix model in frequency domain. The band approximation enable the CS technology to obtain a precise estimation of the fast fading channel with feasible complexity. We also utilize the random grouped pilot pattern, which allows a direct construction of measurement matrix for the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gain when the Doppler spread is at high level.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7757193/7778858/07778868.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","doi":"10.1109/CCI.2016.7778868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCI.2016.7778868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive channel estimation using band approximation for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Estimation","Frequency-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Dispersion","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel estimation","compressed sensing","Doppler shift","fading channels","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive channel estimation","band approximation","OFDM systems","fast fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","sparse compressive sensing problem","delay-Doppler sparse structure","doubly dispersive channel","inter-carrier interference","Doppler shift","banded matrix model","frequency domain","random grouped pilot pattern","Doppler spread"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM","compressive sensing","delay-Doppler sparsity","band approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Compressive channel estimation using band approximation for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525387","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive channel estimation using band approximation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"pp010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056054S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7757193","isNumber":"7778858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7757193","xplore-issue":"7778858","articleId":"7778868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778869,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute Technology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086033205"},{"name":"Zhiqun Song","affiliation":["The 54th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Compration"],"firstName":"Zhiqun","lastName":"Song","id":"37086038105"},{"name":"Xuejun Sha","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute Technology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Sha","id":"37294263700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8515-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8514-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8513-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8516-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778869","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Modulation","Interference","Numerical simulation","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","diversity reception","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single carrier modulation system","SCM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","OFDM system","hybrid carrier modulation system","HCM communication systems","doubly selective channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","SCM","HCM","Doubly selective channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analysis the three communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, single carrier modulation (SCM) system and hybrid carrier modulation (HCM) system under doubly selective (DS) channels.

In order to overcome the effect of these outdated CSIs due to feedback delay, we use minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation to predict the SNRs of the source-to-relay links and the relay-to-destination links at the forwarding instant. Along with the relay selection, an effective power allocation method is proposed to optimize the power allocation between the source and the relays.

Through the experimental data for the farmland fertilizer effect, we propose that fertilizer rate is taken as input for the neural network, and ultimately yield is taken as the output, then building the precise fertilization model. By solving the nonlinear programming problem, the model can get the maximum yield and the optimum fertilizer rate at the same time, and can solve the estimating crop yield problem.

It brings opportunities as well as challenges for cloud users, especially for small and medium size IT business. Trust is one of the important issues. In order to receive the high quality services, cloud users must build trust in the cloud providers. Trust model is one of the effective solutions. However, the existed trust models have defects: \u00a9most of the models cannot evaluate the trust in the cloud provider when service is running; \u00a9Although very few of models can do this, they have a common disadvantage: service is provided by single cloud. In other words, it is incapable of seamless shifting from the running service against Service level Agreement (SLA for short) to the other service. So there is a short time when the service is unavailable. Point to this, Stadam is proposed in this paper which is a new SLA trust model based on the anomaly detection and Multi-cloud. In Stadam, cloud consumer synchronously uses multiple services that are real-time monitored if SLA is fulfilled by using anomaly detection algorithm. Then the SLA trust is updated. According to the current trust the number of requests that are sent to service is dynamically changed. So Stadam not only detect abnormal ongoing service, but also seamlessly switch between multiple services.","doi":"10.1109/CCI.2016.7778951","publicationTitle":"2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7757193/7778858/07778951.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCI.2016.7778951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stadam: A new SLA trust model based on anomaly detection and multi-cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778951/","displayDocTitle":"Stadam: A new SLA trust model based on anomaly detection and multi-cloud","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525436","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778951/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stadam: A new SLA trust model based on anomaly detection and multi-cloud","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"pp093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098683S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7757193","isNumber":"7778858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7757193","xplore-issue":"7778858","articleId":"7778951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778952,"authors":[{"name":"Sixiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sixiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085883339"},{"name":"Xiuze Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuze","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086112949"},{"name":"Kewang Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kewang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086016858"},{"name":"Qi Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085875598"},{"name":"Dongxu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongxu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086103898"},{"name":"Chunxiao He","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunxiao","lastName":"He","id":"37086116267"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8515-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8514-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8513-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8516-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778952","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":495},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","Hardware","Neurons","Training","Neural networks","Noise measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","invasive software","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Trojan detection","ELM neural network","dimension reduction","critical characteristics information","extreme learning machine","self-developed FPGA experiment","side channel current information","target chip","MATLAB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware Trojan detection","ELM","neural network","side channel analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778952","abstract":"Currently the researchers use side channel detection method based on dimension reduction to detect the hardware Trojan, which will lost the critical characteristics information of hardware Trojan after filtering or PCA, and caused a huge computation in the subsequent modeling operations.

It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.","doi":"10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962","publicationTitle":"2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7757193/7778858/07778962.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated state transition-Boolean logic model for security analysis in cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7778962/","displayDocTitle":"An integrated state transition-Boolean logic model for security analysis in cloud computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7778962/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525412","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated state transition-Boolean logic model for security analysis in cloud computing","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"pp104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089115S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7757193","isNumber":"7778858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7757193","xplore-issue":"7778858","articleId":"7778962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7778967,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","affiliation":["School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086097311"},{"name":"Jiang Qian","affiliation":["School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085455584"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8515-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8514-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8513-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8516-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7778967","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2003},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Motion pictures","Training","Sentiment analysis","Analytical models","Recurrent neural networks","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","information retrieval","pattern classification","recurrent neural nets","sentiment analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural networks","emotional attributes","emotion analysis","LSTM","sequence information","RNN language model","multiclassification","information extraction","text data","Internet","long short-term memory","text sentiment analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sentiment analysis","RNN","LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7778967","abstract":"With the rapid development of Internet and big explosion of text data, it has been a very significant research subject to extract valuable information from text ocean.

Compared with the traditional RNN language model, LSTM is better in analyzing emotion of long sentences. And as a language model, LSTM is applied to achieve multi-classification for text emotional attributes. So though training different emotion models, we can know which emotion the sentence belongs to by using these emotion models.

Furthermore, many STBC assume the channels are block-wise constant, but these do not always hold. So RBF based receiver is designed in the paper. With respect to the RBF neural network, PCA(Principal Component Analysis) is applied to process the train samples and growing and pruning(GAP) algorithm is adopted as the learning algorithm.

Due to their sparse structure and competitive performance, they provide multiplier-less and faster dimensionality reduction in applications such as data compression. This letter attempts to relate the notion of extremal set theory to the construction of good CS matrices. In particular, we show that extremal set theory is useful for constructing binary sensing matrices and bounding their maximum column size (i.e., number of columns). We also prove the existence of binary sensing matrices whose column size meets the upper bound. Simulation results show that the constructed matrices outperform Gaussian and Bernoulli random matrices, as well as other deterministic binary and bipolar constructions from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2638426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7811334/07779000.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2638426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of Binary Sensing Matrices Using Extremal Set Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Binary Sensing Matrices Using Extremal Set Theory","volume":"24","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16614899","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779000/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Fellowship","grantNumber":"2/40(63)/2015/R&D-II/4270"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005276","fundingName":"National Board for Higher Mathematics, Government of India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Binary Sensing Matrices Using Extremal Set Theory","sourcePdf":"lsp-murthy-2638426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057689S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7811334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7811334","articleId":"7779000","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7779003,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Ando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7837735/7779003/ando-2638019-small.gif","p":["Masato Ando (S\u201915) was born in 1987.

Stray inductance caused by the wiring structures between dc capacitors and power devices is one of the most critical parameters that influences high-speed switching circuits. This paper presents a design procedure of acceptable stray inductance for high-speed switching circuits based on a scaling method. It should be noted that the stray inductance is designed for not minimization but optimization, and also is shown not as an absolute value [H] but as a percentage value [%]. By applying the proposed procedure, a maximum stray inductance can be designed for power electronics circuits, considering the switching period, the voltage, and the current ratings of the circuits. To verify the proposed procedure, the experimental results are demonstrated using a SiC-MOSFET and a SiC-Schottky Barrier Diode, with voltage and current ratings of 500 V and 400 A,

This paper focuses on combining the concepts of these two paradigms by proposing deep dictionary learning and show how deeper architectures can be built using the layers of dictionary learning. The proposed technique is compared with other deep learning approaches, such as stacked autoencoder, deep belief network, and convolutional neural network. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that the proposed technique achieves higher classification and clustering accuracies. On a real-world problem of electrical appliance classification, we show that deep dictionary learning excels where others do not yield at-par performance.

Inspired by these observations, in this paper, we develop a control approach in which the robot automatic control is combined with impedance control using stiffness transferred from human operator. Under the assumption of linear mapping between muscle surface electromyography signal amplitude and human arm stiffness, we employ the incremental stiffness extraction method in operational space with an improved performance by compensation of the nonlinear residual error in the mapping. The teleoperated robotic exoskeleton is able to replicate the impedance of human operator's arm, and simultaneously, compensate for external disturbances by the technique of disturbance observer. Experimental studies have been carried out to test the antidisturbance ability of the proposed approach for the pose maintenance task in the presence of both stable and unstable interactive forces. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2638403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2638403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7924432/07779012.pdf","startPage":"5171","endPage":"5181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human\u2013Robot Coordination Control of Robotic Exoskeletons by Skill Transfers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Human\u2013Robot Coordination Control of Robotic Exoskeletons by Skill Transfers","volume":"64","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16880065","htmlLink":"/document/7779012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573147, 91520201, 61625303, 61422307 and 61673361"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2014Y2-00507"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Research Collaborative Innovation Projects","grantNumber":"2014B090901056 and 2015B020214003"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Project (Application Technology Research Foundation)","grantNumber":"2015B020233006"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Staring Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Ministry of Education of China"},{"fundingName":"National Youth Top-Notch Talent Support Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human\u2013Robot Coordination Control of Robotic Exoskeletons by Skill Transfers","sourcePdf":"tie-xiao-2638403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101907S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7924432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7924432","articleId":"7779012","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779039,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Gerasimenko","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7779039/geras-2638022-small.gif","p":["Mikhail Gerasimenko received the Specialist degree from the Saint-Petersburg University of Telecommunications in 2011 and the M.Sc. degree from the Tampere University of Technology in 2013.

These emerging architectures call for more advanced methods of cross-RAT radio resource allocation, which are the primary focus of this article. In this paper, based on network flow optimization techniques, we adapt the concept of weighted \u03b1-fairness for efficient resource management in future HetNets. The corresponding scheme relies on a certain degree of centralized control of the HetNet architecture and allows to achieve the desired balance between the overall system throughput and the fairness of the resulting resource allocations based on a single parameter. Our analytical findings, validated with detailed system-level simulations, are expected to further advance the understanding of feasible resource control strategies in intelligent multi-radio networks, as well as help optimize the performance of next-generation HetNets.","topic":"Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16705828","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779039/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Resource Management Strategy in Practical Multi-Radio Heterogeneous Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Researcher Grant by the Acadmey of Finland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004181","fundingName":"Jorma Ollila Grant by Nokia Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Resource Management Strategy in Practical Multi-Radio Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-gerasimenko-2638022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09741S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G"],"articleId":"7779039","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7779043,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Bizzarri","affiliation":["DEIB, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Bizzarri","orcid":"0000-0002-6568-6491","id":"37299065400"},{"name":"Angelo Maurizio Brambilla","affiliation":["DEIB, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo Maurizio","lastName":"Brambilla","orcid":"0000-0001-9422-6446","id":"37357295600"},{"name":"Sergio Callegari","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, IT"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Callegari","orcid":"0000-0001-6719-598X","id":"37269711600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7779043","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":505},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Steady-state","Phase frequency detector","Integrated circuit modeling","MOSFET","Frequency conversion","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","frequency dividers","phase locked loops","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u03a3\u0394 modulators","spurious tones","power spectral density","PSD","frequency divider","undesirable nonlinear effects","static mismatch","dynamic mismatch","digital delay","reset path","phase-frequency detector","fractional phase locked loop","spurious tone injection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sigma-delta (\u03a3\u0394) modulator (\u03a3\u0394m)","fractional phase-locked loop (PLL)","quantization noise","spurious tones"]}],"abstract":"In fractional phase-locked loop driven by \u03a3\u0394 modulators there can be spurious tones in the power spectral density (PSD) of output signals even if the PSDs of the sequences used to drive the frequency divider are spur-free.

In addition, a cost-effective and reliable test scheme is introduced so the three approaches can share a single common test board to avoid potential hardware-to-hardware deviation. Measurement results on three software-controlled operation states are compared with respective TIS measured in an anechoic chamber. The best correlation was obtained in the proposed equivalent dipole-moment-based evaluation method and the limitations of the two previous methods are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2016.2633332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/7835246/07779045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2016.2633332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835246","startPage":"633","endPage":"638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of Integrated Circuits Emissions With an Equivalent Dipole-Moment Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of Integrated Circuits Emissions With an Equivalent Dipole-Moment Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16637078","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779045/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of Integrated Circuits Emissions With an Equivalent Dipole-Moment Method","sourcePdf":"temc-hwang-2633332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057692S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"7835246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7835246","articleId":"7779045","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7779046,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Guo","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7872536/7779046/guo-2638425-small.gif","p":["Shu Guo received the MS degree in intelligence science from the\n National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2014.

Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts. The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact. In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space. Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption. Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task. Two lines of embedding strategies are tested, i.e., strategies based on latent distance models and strategies based on tensor factorization techniques. We empirically evaluate SSE on two benchmark tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superiority and generality of SSE.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2016.2638425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/7872536/07779046.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2016.2638425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7872536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSE: Semantically Smooth Embedding for Knowledge Graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"SSE: Semantically Smooth Embedding for Knowledge Graphs","volume":"29","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16742120","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779046/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779046/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402465"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDA06030200"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSE: Semantically Smooth Embedding for Knowledge Graphs","sourcePdf":"tkde-wang-2638425-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147998S","chronDate":"April 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7872536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7872536","articleId":"7779046","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779048,"authors":[{"name":"Daoyuan Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering & New Energy, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Daoyuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085395910"},{"name":"Yanjun Shen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering & New Energy, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Shen","orcid":"0000-0003-2970-3108","id":"37400480600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7779048","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":772},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Nonlinear systems","Delay effects","Delays","Stability analysis","Design methodology","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","continuous systems","delays","discrete systems","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","observers","sampled data systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling period","high gain observer design","triangular nonlinear systems","sampled output measurements","delayed output measurements","transmission delay","hybrid systems","sufficient conditions","continuous-discrete observer","specially constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","observation errors","design methods","continuous sampled-data observer design","time delay","global stability","exponential stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delayed output measurements","high-gain","hybrid systems","sampled-data observer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779048","abstract":"This technical note addresses the problem of high gain observer design for a class of triangular nonlinear systems with sampled and delayed output measurements.

Among these, the scarcity of ramp capability is an important culprit of power balance violations and high scarcity prices. To address this issue, market-based flexible ramping products (FRPs) have been proposed in the industry to improve the availability of ramp capacity. This paper presents an in-depth review of the modeling and implementation of FRPs. The major motivation is that although FRPs are widely discussed in the literature, it is still unclear to many that how they can be incorporated into a co-optimization framework that includes energy and ancillary services. The concept and a definition of power system operational flexibility as well as the needs for FRPs are introduced. The industrial practices of implementing FRPs under different market structures are presented. Market operation issues and future research topics are also discussed. This paper can provide researchers and power engineers with further insights into the state of the art, technical barriers, and potential directions for FRPs.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2637879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2637879","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1664","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8000716/07779055.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Power System Operational Flexibility With Flexible Ramping Products: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Power System Operational Flexibility With Flexible Ramping Products: A Review","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779055/","accessionNumber":"17099261","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779055/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium","grantNumber":"DE-AC36-08GO28308"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Power System Operational Flexibility With Flexible Ramping Products: A Review","sourcePdf":"tii-wang-2637879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149686S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8000716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8000716","articleId":"7779055","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7779064,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ding","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ding","orcid":"0000-0003-0804-6444","id":"37396701500"},{"name":"You-Feng Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"You-Feng","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0002-2527-6615","id":"37085662446"},{"name":"Wei Shao","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shao","id":"37280513300"},{"name":"Hua Li","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Li","id":"38090805600"},{"name":"Bing-Zhong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280506100"},{"name":"Dimitris E.

A pattern reconfigurable technique is used to design the element that enhances scanning gain and decreases the sidelobe level throughout the entire scanning range. The array is comprised of eight elements in a 2\u00d74 arrangement with uniform spacing. The proposed phased array operates at 5.8 GHz and can scan with 3 dB beamwidth the entire upper ground elevation plane from -90\u00b0 to +90\u00b0 enabled by a two-step pattern reconfigurability mechanism consisting of: 1) coarse-angle scanning and 2) line-angle scanning. Significant outcomes also include the reduced sidelobe level (less than 7.8 dB) and the particularly small fluctuation (\u00b10.75 dB) of the gain during scanning over a scanning range of 150\u00b0 (from 75\u00b0 to +75\u00b0 in the elevation plane). With the absence of any structure above the ground level, the high efficiency, and the coverage of the entire upper half-space, this proposed antenna array is very attractive for a variety of phased array applications, particularly those that require a Hush-mounted structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wide-Angle Scanning Planar Phased Array with Pattern Reconfigurable Magnetic Current Element","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2637863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7867877/07779064.pdf","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2637863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7867877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779064","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8/7867877/7779064-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Wide-Angle Scanning Planar Phased Array with Pattern Reconfigurable Magnetic Current Element","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7779064/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16708603","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"#61331007, #61361166008 and #61401065"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"#1310400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000104","fundingName":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, EPSCoR","grantNumber":"#NNX15AM83A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Wide-Angle Scanning Planar Phased Array with Pattern Reconfigurable Magnetic Current Element","sourcePdf":"tap-anagnostou-2637863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054213S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7867877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7867877","articleId":"7779064","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7779070,"authors":[{"name":"Jaemin Lim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaemin","lastName":"Lim","id":"37086196624"},{"name":"Hyunwoo Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunwoo","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085815838"},{"name":"Kiyeon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiyeon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086196253"},{"name":"Minho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086196850"},{"name":"Suk-Bok Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suk-Bok","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-1855-4111","id":"37311342000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7779070","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1132},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Privacy","Internet","Global Positioning System","Delays","Mobile radio mobility management","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location privacy","location-based services","in-car LTE Internet","car-to-car dedicated short-range communications","privacy protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location-based services","location privacy","location tracking protection","vehicular networks"]}],"abstract":"Connected vehicles are at risk of exposing their location history when using potentially untrusted location-based services (LBSs) in the driving process. We propose a method called mutually obfuscating paths (MOP) that enables vehicles to provide highly accurate realtime location updates to LBS while preventing the LBS from tracking vehicles. The instrument is to leverage connected vehicles' two network interfaces: in-car LTE Internet (for accessing LBS) and car-to-car Dedicated short-range communications (DSRC)-communication (for obfuscating their paths). The main idea of MOP is that vehicles, when appropriate, generate made-up but plausible location updates for each other, making their paths continuously branching off from the LBS' viewpoint. We evaluations show that MOP provides strong privacy protection even under continuous and highly accurate location updates.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2637902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2637902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07779070.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preserving Location Privacy of Connected Vehicles With Highly Accurate Location Updates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Preserving Location Privacy of Connected Vehicles With Highly Accurate Location Updates","volume":"21","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779070/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723224","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779070/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung Research Funding Center for Future Technology","grantNumber":"SRFC-IT1402-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A2A01003696"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preserving Location Privacy of Connected Vehicles With Highly Accurate Location Updates","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lee-2637902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081636S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7779070","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779074,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Mishra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Bharti School of Telecommunication, IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37085433827"},{"name":"Swades De","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Bharti School of Telecommunication, IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Swades","lastName":"De","orcid":"0000-0003-3979-1025","id":"37276067100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"7779074","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":936},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779074","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Throughput","Wireless sensor networks","Rician channels","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","energy harvesting","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated information relay","energy supply assisted RF harvesting communication","finite lifetime bottleneck","ubiquitous deployment","low-power wireless devices","Internet-of-Things","cooperative communication","distant energy-constrained wireless nodes","RF energy transfer","i2RES-powered information transfer","delay-limited achievable throughput","Rician channels","time allocation","throughput maximization problem","closed-form approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RF energy harvesting","outage analysis","throughput maximization","generalized-convexity","rate-energy tradeoff"]}],"abstract":"To overcome finite lifetime bottleneck in the ubiquitous deployment of low-power wireless devices in Internet-of-Things, we propose a novel integrated information relay and energy supply (i\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nRES)-assisted RF harvesting co-operative communication model. i\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nRES aids the communication between two distant energy-constrained wireless nodes by: 1) RF energy transfer to the source and 2) relaying source data along with supplying energy to the destination.

Most of these studies adopt activations from a single DCNN layer, usually a fully-connected layer, as the image representation. In this paper, we proposed a novel way to extract image representations from two consecutive convolutional layers: one layer is used for local feature extraction and the other serves as guidance to pool the extracted features. By taking different viewpoints of convolutional layers, we further develop two schemes to realize this idea. The first directly uses convolutional layers from a DCNN. The second applies the pretrained CNN on densely sampled image regions and treats the fully-connected activations of each image region as a convolutional layer's feature activations. We then train another convolutional layer on top of that as the pooling-guidance convolutional layer. By applying our method to three popular visual classification tasks, we find that our first scheme tends to perform better on applications which demand strong discrimination on lower-level visual patterns while the latter excels in cases that require discrimination on category-level patterns. Overall, the proposed method achieves superior performance over existing approaches for extracting image representations from a DCNN. In addition, we apply cross-layer pooling to the problem of image retrieval and propose schemes to reduce the computational cost. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method achieves promising results for the image retrieval task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17256350","pubMedId":"27959804","htmlLink":"/document/7779086/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2017","volume":"39","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cross-Convolutional-Layer Pooling for Image Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Data to Decisions Cooperative Research Centre"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Future Fellowship","grantNumber":"FT120100969"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP160103710 and LP130100156"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Convolutional-Layer Pooling for Image Recognition","sourcePdf":"tpami-shen-2637921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104143S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8055017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8055017","articleId":"7779086","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7779092,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Similarly, in the functional index coding problem, the side information and demands of the clients include disjoint sets of functions of the information messages held by the transmitter instead of disjoint subsets of the messages, as is the case in the conventional index coding problem. It is known that any network coding problem can be transformed into an index coding problem and vice versa. In this paper, we establish a similar relationship between network computation problems and functional index coding problems. We show that any network computation problem can be converted into a functional index coding problem and vice versa. We prove that a solution for a network computation problem exists if and only if a functional index code (of a specific length determined by the network computation problem) for a suitably constructed functional index coding problem exists. Next, we show that a functional index coding problem admits a solution of a specified length if and only if a suitably constructed network computation problem admits a solution.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637922","startPage":"705","endPage":"714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07779096.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Relation Between Network Computation and Functional Index Coding Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Relation Between Network Computation and Functional Index Coding Problems","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16669122","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779096/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, through J.C.

Such architecture mitigates filter resonance and offers good stability under stiff- and weak-grid conditions. However, its merits are offset by requiring many sensors, dedicated control loop to regulate the operating frequency, and high-precision intracycle information of the circuit variables to dictate the states of the switches. A modified cascaded boundary-deadbeat control law with reduced number of current sensors, the use of current band to regulate the operating frequency, and intracycle information recovery mechanism of the filter capacitor voltage for a virtually-grounded three-phase grid-connected inverter with LCL filter is presented. It inherits the merits of allowing the inverter to exhibit fast dynamic response and mitigating filter resonance. The contaminated intracycle information of the filter capacitor voltage is recovered so as to estimate and predict state trajectories accurately. Furthermore, a dc bus voltage feedforward injection scheme with reduced number of voltage sensor is proposed. It utilizes the duty cycle information of the gate signals to compensate the effect of the unbalanced dc bus capacitor voltages on causing modulation saturation and current distortion. The system characteristics under parametric variations will be studied. A 3-kW prototype has been built and evaluated under stiff- and weak-grid conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07779101.pdf","startPage":"8163","endPage":"8180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2637078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Cascaded Boundary-Deadbeat Control for a Virtually-Grounded Three-Phase Grid-Connected Inverter With LCL Filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inverters","Information filters","Capacitors","Sensors","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","feedforward","filters","invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified cascaded boundary-deadbeat control","virtually-grounded three-phase grid-connected inverter","LCL filter","cascaded boundary-deadbeat controller","current sensors","filter resonance","filter capacitor voltage","dc bus voltage feedforward injection scheme","dc bus capacitor voltages","modulation saturation","current distortion","power 3 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundary control","deadbeat control","inverters","LCL filter","second-order switching surface","stiff grid","weak grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modified Cascaded Boundary-Deadbeat Control for a Virtually-Grounded Three-Phase Grid-Connected Inverter With LCL Filter","volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7779101/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"16880342","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China"},{"fundingName":"NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme","grantNumber":"Project N_CityU128/15 and Project 51561165013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Cascaded Boundary-Deadbeat Control for a Virtually-Grounded Three-Phase Grid-Connected Inverter With LCL Filter","sourcePdf":"tpel-chung-2637078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103055S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7779101","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7779107,"authors":[{"name":"Chaudhry Adnan Aslam","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7779107/aslam-2637913-small.gif","p":["Chaudhry Adnan Aslam (S\u201913) received the B.E. degree (Hons.) from the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan, and the M.S. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

The proposed schedules selectively update the edges of the code graph based on the run-time reliability of variable and check nodes. Specifically, new message update is propagated exclusively along the unreliable edges of the code graph. This reduces the decoding complexity of BP algorithm as only a partial set of message updates is computed per decoding iteration. Besides, restricting the flow of message updates may also precludes the occurrence of some short graph cycles, which helps to preserve the BP message independence at certain variable and check nodes. Using numerical simulations, it is shown that the proposed edge-based schedules reduce the BP decoding complexity by more than 90% compared with the prior-art BP schedules, while simultaneously improving the error-rate performance, at medium-to-high signal-to-noise ratio over additive white Gaussian noise channel.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637913","startPage":"525","endPage":"535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07779107.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-Based Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC and RS Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Edge-Based Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC and RS Codes","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16669156","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779107/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NTU Research Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-MIT International Design Center (IDC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-Based Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC and RS Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chaudhry-2637913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123717S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7779107","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7779113,"authors":[{"name":"Naihao Liu","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, School of Electronicand Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Naihao","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-2609-7408","id":"37086094757"},{"name":"Jinghuai Gao","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Offshore Oil Exploration, School of Electronicand Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jinghuai","lastName":"Gao","id":"37310259600"},{"name":"Xiudi Jiang","affiliation":["Research Center of China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiudi","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085935448"},{"name":"Zhuosheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhuosheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086096196"},{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-9298-5913","id":"37086100323"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"7779113","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":786},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"Time-frequency (TF) analysis can reveal local variations in seismic data processing and interpretation, where seismic signals are nonstationary and time varying. High-quality TF representation (TFR) is important for revealing the local information about these nonstationary seismic signals and describing geological structures. Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, traditional TF methods (e.g., short time Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform) cannot get the finest time resolution and the best frequency resolution at the same time, which leads to ambiguous TFR with a negative effect on the seismic signal analysis. Concentration in frequency and time is proposed to distinguish the different TF contents of time-dependent signals with time-varying amplitude and instantaneous frequencies. We introduce this promising TF analysis tool to seismic data processing.

Basic channel evaluation metrics are examined to facilitate the selection of the appropriate communication technique. The ergodic channel capacity is found between 4.1 and 6.1 b/s/Hz and varies significantly with the elevation angle. The capacity is highly correlated with the terminal trajectory and signal reception. The cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is found between 14.2 and 22.5 dB, whereas the cross-polarization isolation (XPI) is found between 12.8 and 21 dB, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation statistics and channel capacities are well approximated by existing stochastic channel models. Finally, from the channel stationarity analysis, large stationarity regions are found, the existence of which is also correlated with the terminal trajectory. The mean quasi-stationarity time is found between 41 and 66 s for different environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

The used third-order tunable diplexer with two independently tuned channels consists of one common varactor-tuned lumped-element dual-resonance resonator and two varactor-tuned LC resonators. The ports of its two channels are connected by a single-pole double-throw switch, so that one port of the tunable BPF is constituted. And its common port serves as the other port of the tunable BPF. In the switched tunable diplexer design, its direct current (dc) bias voltages are also appropriately selected to improve the in-band and out-of-band performances of the tunable BPF. As examples, a third-order tunable diplexer with constant return loss of 15 dB is first designed. The measured results show that the 3 dB cutoff frequency of its lower channel can be tuned from 0.5 to 1.02 GHz, while the 3 dB cutoff frequency of its upper channel can be tuned from 1.01 to 1.78 GHz. Then, a tunable BPF is designed, and its 3 dB cutoff frequency covers from 0.485 to 1.82 GHz.

The FDTD equations for a rectangular region are interpreted as a dynamical system having the magnetic field on the boundary as input and the electric field on the boundary as output. Suitable expressions for the energy stored in the region and the energy absorbed from the boundaries are introduced, and used to show that the FDTD system is dissipative under a generalized Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Based on the concept of dissipation, a powerful theoretical framework to investigate the stability of FDTD-like methods is devised. The new method makes FDTD stability proofs simpler, more intuitive, and modular. Stability conditions can indeed be given on the individual components (e.g., boundary conditions, meshes, and embedded models) instead of the whole coupled setup. As an example of application, we derive a new subgridding scheme with support for material traverse, arbitrary grid refinement, and guaranteed stability. The method is easy to implement and has a straightforward stability proof. Numerical results confirm its stability, low reflections, and ability to handle material traverse.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2637867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07779120.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2637867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dissipative Systems Theory for FDTD With Application to Stability Analysis and Subgridding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779120/","displayDocTitle":"A Dissipative Systems Theory for FDTD With Application to Stability Analysis and Subgridding","volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639068","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779120/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant Program)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dissipative Systems Theory for FDTD With Application to Stability Analysis and Subgridding","sourcePdf":"tap-bekmambetova-2637867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088682S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7779120","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7779125,"authors":[{"name":"Bingxian Mu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China","Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7924432/7779125/mu-2638398-small.gif","p":["Bingxian Mu (S\u201916) was born in Taiyuan, China, in 1985.

The directed and switching communication topologies are considered. The control protocols for the first-order/second-order system dynamics are designed with bounded control gains. The Rotate&Run scheme is proposed to update the vehicles' states: 1) the vehicle calculates its goal orientation and the input of each wheel at the sampling time instants by using the states of itself and the neighbors; 2) the vehicle rotates in place until it aims at the calculated direction; and 3) the vehicle moves forward/backward with the calculated wheel velocities until the next sampling time instant. It is shown that consensus in a group of 2WMRs can be achieved when the switching directed graphs satisfy certain conditions. The convergence analysis of consensus is conducted based on the algebraic graph theory and stochastic matrix analysis. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7779125/","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16880082","volume":"64","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Nonuniform Sampling Cooperative Control on A Group of Two-Wheeled Mobile Robots","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Nonuniform Sampling Cooperative Control on A Group of Two-Wheeled Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tie-shi-2638398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077999S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7924432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7924432","articleId":"7779125","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7779131,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Junaid Farooq","affiliation":["New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Qatar Mobility Innovations Center, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7779131/faroo-2637917-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Junaid Farooq (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, in 2015.

Due to the randomness in both RE generation and mobile traffic at each base station (BS), a surplus or shortfall of energy may occur at any given time. To increase energy self-reliance and minimize the network's energy cost, the operator needs to efficiently exploit the RE generated across all BSs. In this paper, a hybrid energy sharing framework for cellular network is proposed, where a combination of physical power lines and energy trading with other BSs using smart grid is used. Algorithms for physical power lines deployment between BSs, based on average and complete statistics of the net RE available, are developed. Afterward, an energy management framework is formulated to optimally determine the quantities of electricity and RE to be procured and exchanged among BSs, respectively, while considering battery capacities and real-time energy pricing. Three cases are investigated, where RE generation is unknown, perfectly known, and partially known ahead of time. Results investigate the time varying energy management of BSs and demonstrate considerable reduction in average energy cost thanks to the hybrid energy sharing scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07779131.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Energy Sharing Framework for Green Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Energy Sharing Framework for Green Cellular Networks","volume":"65","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779131/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669151","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779131/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP # 6-001-2-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Energy Sharing Framework for Green Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-farooq-2637917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163842S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7779131","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779135,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7779135/zhang-2637926-small.gif","p":["Jiayi Zhang (S\u201908\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in communication engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, China, in 2007 and 2014, respectively.

The so-called higher order statistics (HOS) of the channel capacity is a suitable metric on the system performance. While prior relevant works have improved our knowledge on the HOS characterization of spectrum aggregation systems, an analytical framework encompassing generalized fading models of interest is not yet available. In this paper, we pursue a detailed HOS analysis of \u03ba-\u03bc and \u03ba-\u03bc shadowed fading channels by deriving novel and exact expressions. Furthermore, the simplified HOS expressions for the asymptotically low and high signal-tonoise regimes are derived. Several important statistical measures, such as amount of fading, amount of dispersion, reliability, skewness, and kurtosis, are obtained by using the HOS results. More importantly, the useful implications of system and fading parameters on spectrum aggregation systems are investigated for channel selection. Finally, all derived expressions are validated via Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07779135.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2637926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On High-Order Capacity Statistics of Spectrum Aggregation Systems Over $\\kappa $ - $\\mu $ and $\\kappa $ - $\\mu $ Shadowed Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On High-Order Capacity Statistics of Spectrum Aggregation Systems Over $\\kappa $ - $\\mu $ and $\\kappa $ - $\\mu $ Shadowed Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779135/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669143","htmlLink":"/document/7779135/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601020 and 61371068"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016RC013, 2016JBZ003 and 2014JBZ002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On High-Order Capacity Statistics of Spectrum Aggregation Systems Over $\\kappa $ - $\\mu $ and $\\kappa $ - $\\mu $ Shadowed Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2637926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153987S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7779135","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779137,"authors":[{"name":"Xingguang Wei","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing and Communication Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7779137/wei-2634038-small.gif","p":["Xingguang Wei received the B.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), China, in 2015.

In this paper, we implement a practical downlink NOMA system based on an open-source software defined radio (SDR) platform named as OpenAirInterface (OAI). For comparison purpose, our SDR-based NOMA system follows the basic specifications of long term evolution (LTE). In this system, a codeword-level successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver is implemented. To improve the efficiency of the baseband signal processing in an SIC receiver, a multi-thread processing method is also introduced. Due to the limitation of original downlink control information (DCI) formats in current LTE systems, a new DCI format is dedicatedly designed for signal reconstitution in our developed NOMA system. Furthermore, some parts of upper layer protocols in LTE systems are modified to support the application services over the developed NOMA system. Based on our NOMA system, a series of over-the-air experiments are carried out, and the experiment results demonstrate that the NOMA scheme has a significant throughput gain compared with an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2634038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07779137.pdf","startPage":"9604","endPage":"9613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2634038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Defined Radio Implementation of a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System Towards 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Software Defined Radio Implementation of a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System Towards 5G","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779137/","accessionNumber":"16606944","volume":"4","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A705"},{"fundingName":"China Natural Science Funding","grantNumber":"61271183"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014ZD03-02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Software Defined Radio Implementation of a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System Towards 5G","sourcePdf":"access-zheng-2634038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113253S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7779137","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779139,"authors":[{"name":"Zhezhi He","affiliation":["Department of the Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/7938807/7779139/he-2633966-small.gif","p":["ZHEZHI HE (S\u201916) received the BS degree in information science\n and engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2012 and the ME degree in electrical and computer\n engineering from Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, in 2015.

Different logic functions can be implemented by reconfiguring the weights and threshold of the same TLG circuit. This paper introduces a novel design of reconfigurable Spintronic Threshold Logic Gate (STLG), which employs spintronic weight devices to perform current-mode weighted summation of binary inputs, whereas, the low voltage fast switching spintronic threshold device carries out the threshold operation in an energy efficient manner. The proposed STLG operates at a small terminal voltage of 50 mV, resulting in ultra-low energy consumption. A bottom-up cross-layer simulation framework is developed to synthesize and map large scale digital logic functions to the proposed STLG circuits. The simulation results of ISCAS-85 benchmarks show that the proposed STLG based reconfigurable logic hardware can achieve two orders lower Energy-Delay Product (EDP) compared with state-of-the-art CMOS Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and smaller EDP compared to large scale Memristive Threshold Logic (MTL) based FPGA. Moreover, the ultra-low programming energy of spintronic weight device also leads to three orders lower reconfiguration energy of STLG compared to MTL design.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2016.2633966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","startPage":"223","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7938807/07779139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2016.2633966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Reconfigurable Threshold Logic Circuit with Spintronic Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Magnetic tunneling","Field programmable gate arrays","Strips","Performance evaluation","Magnetic domain walls"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","energy conservation","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","magnetoelectronics","threshold logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient reconfigurable threshold logic circuit","multiple-binary inputs","logic function","TLG circuit","reconfigurable spintronic threshold logic gate","spintronic weight devices","current-mode weighted summation","low-voltage fast switching spintronic threshold device","ultralow-energy consumption","bottom-up cross-layer simulation framework","large-scale digital logic functions","STLG circuits","ISCAS-85 benchmarks","STLG-based reconfigurable logic hardware","two-order lower-energy-delay product","CMOS field programmable gate arrays","CMOS FPGA","large-scale memristive threshold logic-based FPGA","large-scale MTL-based FPGA","ultralow-programming energy","MTL design","voltage 50 mV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic domain wall strip","reconfigurable logic","threshold logic","magnetic tunnel junction","spintronic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Reconfigurable Threshold Logic Circuit with Spintronic Devices","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16931653","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779139/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779139/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007900","fundingName":"UCF"},{"fundingName":"SCEEE Development Fund"},{"fundingName":"Southeastern Association of Electrical Engineering Department Heads"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Reconfigurable Threshold Logic Circuit with Spintronic Devices","sourcePdf":"tetc-he-2633966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10298S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7938807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7938807","articleId":"7779139","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779145,"authors":[{"name":"Raf Appeltans","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium","Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7779145/appel-2633004-small.gif","p":["Raf Appeltans (S\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in industrial sciences: electronic engineering from the Group T International University College Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in collaboration with imec, Leuven, with a focus on the topic of nonvolatile memories in advanced FinFET nodes.","He was a Development Engineer from 2010 to 2012 with imec, where he was involved in processor architecture design for wireless communication."]},"firstName":"Raf","lastName":"Appeltans","orcid":"0000-0003-1617-8228","id":"37589459100"},{"name":"Praveen Raghavan","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7779145/ragha-2633004-small.gif","p":["Praveen Raghavan (S\u201904\u2013M\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2009.","He is currently a Principal Engineer with the Logic Department of imec, Leuven, Belgium.

It suffers, however, from the low resistance difference between the bistable states of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). Variability on MTJ resistance and access transistors makes reliable read-out even more challenging. This triggered the use of complementary cells for low level caches needing high performance. This paper, focusing on the lower level caches, shows an improved 3T 2MTJ cell with a ground grid and a novel three transistor read and write operation to improve area density, sense margin, write performance, and write energy consumption. Despite the cell's three transistors, the improved array configuration reduces the cell area by 22% as compared with the 2T 2MTJ cell, making it only 55% larger than a 1T 1MTJ cell. The novel mismatch tolerant read operation uses all three transistors and increases the sense margin by up to 88%. The novel variation resilient write operation also uses all three transistors and takes advantage of the inherent MTJ characteristics and complementary operation of the cell. This increases the write performance by 2\u00d7 and reduces the write energy by 3\u00d7 compared with the 2T 2MTJ cell and by 1.5\u00d7 compared with the 1T 1MTJ cell.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2633004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7882729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2633004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7882729/07779145.pdf","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Smaller, Faster, and More Energy-Efficient Complementary STT-MRAM Cell Uses Three Transistors and a Ground Grid: More Is Actually Less","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Smaller, Faster, and More Energy-Efficient Complementary STT-MRAM Cell Uses Three Transistors and a Ground Grid: More Is Actually Less","volume":"25","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779145/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16759760","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779145/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Smaller, Faster, and More Energy-Efficient Complementary STT-MRAM Cell Uses Three Transistors and a Ground Grid: More Is Actually Less","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-appeltans-2633004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066382S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7882729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7882729","articleId":"7779145","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779146,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Ramezani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7779146/ramez-2631724-small.gif","p":["Reza Ramezani was born in 1989.

It consists in carrying out the reconfiguration of some tasks within the execution of the previous TG, plus increasing the redundancy level of the early fetched tasks. Experimental results on actual TGs show the positive impacts of the proposed technique. Thus, without deteriorating the execution time (makespan), on average, a 114% MTTF improvement is achieved for no-fault-tolerant TGs, and the improvement is more significant when applying to fault-tolerant TGs. Finally, this paper presents a hardware implementation of a manager that applies these techniques at runtime and steers the execution of the running TGs.

Energy storage is essential in providing flexibility and ensuring system reliability. Storage sizing problem is widely studied for a given demand curve, and the needed storage capacity to achieve a certain level of peak-shaving performance is not analyzed. In this paper, a probabilistic model of storage sizing with peak-shaving policy optimization under required matching probability is established to minimize net cost considering time-variant energy price. Storage is used not only for reducing energy deficit and keeping generation reliable but also for energy shifting to obtain higher profit. A cyclic nonhomogeneous Markov chain (CNHMC) steady-state analysis method is proposed, serving as a more efficient way to test probability constraint than commonly used time-consuming sequential Monte-Carlo simulation. CNHMC is used in stored power modeling representing diurnal variation of wind power and load. Probability constraint is tested by obtained analytical expression of matching probability. Numerical test shows that reliable power supply is achieved with little profit sacrifice, peak/valley net load difference decreases with little increment on storage capacity, and the proposed solution method is fast and accurate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16969801","htmlLink":"/document/7779148/","displayDocTitle":"Storage Sizing With Peak-Shaving Policy for Wind Farm Based on Cyclic Markov Chain Model","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0901904"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1301254, 61473218 and 61304212"},{"fundingName":"111 International Collaboration Program, of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Storage Sizing With Peak-Shaving Policy for Wind Farm Based on Cyclic Markov Chain Model","sourcePdf":"tste-dong-2637916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109474S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7953694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7953694","articleId":"7779148","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7779151,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Stuckman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/24/7867805/7779151/stuck-2630503-small.gif","p":["Jeffrey Stuckman (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree from Case\n Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park,\n MD, USA, both in computer science.","His research interests include software security data collection, software measurement, and the actionability of\n information from software predictive models."]},"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Stuckman","id":"38232778700"},{"name":"James Walden","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northern Kentucky University, Highland Heights, KY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/24/7867805/7779151/walde-2630503-small.gif","p":["James Walden (M\u201906) received the Ph.D. degree from Carnegie\n Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.","He is an Associate Professor at Northern Kentucky University, Newport, KY, USA.

Two aspects of vulnerability prediction models have a profound impact on their performance: 1) the features (i.e., the characteristics of the software) that are used as predictors and 2) the way those features are used in the setup of the statistical learning machinery. In a previous work, we compared models based on two different types of features: software metrics and term frequencies (text mining features). In this paper, we broaden the set of models we compare by investigating an array of techniques for the manipulation of said features. These techniques fall under the umbrella of dimensionality reduction and have the potential to improve the ability of a prediction model to localize vulnerabilities. We explore the role of dimensionality reduction through a series of cross-validation and cross-project prediction experiments. Our results show that in the case of software metrics, a dimensionality reduction technique based on confirmatory factor analysis provided an advantage when performing cross-project prediction, yielding the best F-measure for the predictions in five out of six cases. In the case of text mining, feature selection can make the prediction computationally faster, but no dimensionality reduction technique provided any other notable advantage.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2016.2630503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7867805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2016.2630503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/7867805/07779151.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Dimensionality Reduction on Software Vulnerability Prediction Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Dimensionality Reduction on Software Vulnerability Prediction Models","volume":"66","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779151/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16707499","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779151/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"United States Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N000141210147"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Dimensionality Reduction on Software Vulnerability Prediction Models","sourcePdf":"tr-stuckman-2630503-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197569S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7867805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7867805","articleId":"7779151","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7779152,"authors":[{"name":"Xinmiao Zhang","affiliation":["Western Digital Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xinmiao Zhang (S\u201904\u2013M\u201905\u2013SM\u201910) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 2005.","She joined SanDisk (Western Digital) Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA, in 2013.

The encoding of these codes is traditionally done by multiplying the message vector with a generator matrix consisting of dense circulant submatrices. To reduce the encoder complexity, this paper introduces two schemes making use of finite Fourier transform. We focus on QC-LDPC codes whose circulant submatrices are of dimension (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sup>\n - 1) \u00d7 (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sup>\n - 1) and the entries are elements of GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sup>\n), where p divides r, and hence, GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sup>\n) is a subfield of GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sup>\n).

Making use of conjugacy constraints, low-complexity architectures are developed for finite Fourier and inverse transforms over subfields in this paper.

Our approach contributes to the big data field with parallel algorithms tailored for GPU architectures. We remove the data dependency between frames and achieve pixel-level parallelism. Due to the large size, the entire dataset cannot fit into cached memory. Frames have to be streamed through the memory hierarchy (disk to CPU main memory and then to GPU memory), partitioned, and processed as batches, where each batch is small enough to fit into the GPU. To reconnect the feature regions that are separated due to data partitioning, we present a novel batch merging algorithm to extract the region connection information across multiple batches in a parallel fashion. The information is organized in a memory-efficient structure and supports fast indexing on the GPU. Our experiment uses a commodity workstation equipped with a single GPU. The results show that our approach can efficiently process a weather dataset composed of terabytes of time-varying radar images. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated by comparing to the performance of an efficient CPU cluster implementation which is being used by the weather scientists.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-Accelerated Approach for Feature Tracking in Time-Varying Imagery Datasets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2016.2637904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/8023908/07779153.pdf","startPage":"2262","endPage":"2274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2637904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8023908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779153","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/2945/8023908/7779153-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A GPU-Accelerated Approach for Feature Tracking in Time-Varying Imagery Datasets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7779153/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2017","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169249","pubMedId":"27959814","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 1464323"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"NVIDIA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006302","fundingName":"UAH"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A GPU-Accelerated Approach for Feature Tracking in Time-Varying Imagery Datasets","sourcePdf":"tvcg-peng-2637904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157864S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"8023908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8023908","articleId":"7779153","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7779154,"authors":[{"name":"Qinglai Wei","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8359228/7779154/wei-2623766-small.gif","p":["Qinglai Wei (M\u201911) received the B.S. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2002 and 2009, respectively.","From 2009 to 2011, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, where he is currently a Professor.

The present local iterative ADP algorithm permits an arbitrary positive semidefinite function to initialize the algorithm. Employing a state-dependent learning rate function, for the first time, the iterative value function and iterative control law can be updated in a subset of the state space instead of the whole state space, which effectively relaxes the computational burden. A new analysis method for the convergence property is developed to prove that the iterative value functions will converge to the optimum under some mild constraints. Monotonicity of the local value iteration ADP algorithm is presented, which shows that under some special conditions of the initial value function and the learning rate function, the iterative value function can monotonically converge to the optimum. Finally, three simulation examples and comparisons are given to illustrate the performance of the developed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2623766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8359228/07779154.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2623766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-Time Local Value Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming: Convergence Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779154/","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-Time Local Value Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming: Convergence Analysis","volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17754559","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779154/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61233001, 61273140, 61374105, 61503379, 61304079, 61673054, 61533017 and U1501251"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"FRF-TP-15-056A3"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Project from SKLMCCS","grantNumber":"20150104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-Time Local Value Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming: Convergence Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wei-2623766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197703S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8359228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8359228","articleId":"7779154","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7779155,"authors":[{"name":"Anggoro Primadianto","affiliation":["Electrical Energi Transaction, PLN Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8012582/7779155/prima-2632156-small.gif","p":["Anggoro Primadianto received the M.S. degree in electrical\n engineering from National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan in 2015.

Power networks are undergoing a transition from the traditional model of centralised generation towards a smart decentralised network of renewable sources and ES systems, organised into autonomous microgrids. ES systems can provide a range of services, particularly when distributed throughout the power network. The introduction of distributed ES represents a fundamental change for power networks, increasing the network control problem dimensionality and adding long time-scale dynamics associated with the storage systems' state of charge levels. Managing microgrids with many small distributed ES systems requires new scalable control strategies that are robust to power network and communication network disturbances. This paper reviews the range of services distributed ES systems can provide, and the control challenges they introduce. The focus of this paper is a presentation of the latest decentralised, centralised and distributed multi-agent control strategies designed to coordinate distributed microgrid ES systems. Finally, multi-agent control with agents satisfying Wooldridge's definition of intelligence is proposed as a promising direction for future research.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2637958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07779156.pdf","startPage":"3652","endPage":"3666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2637958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Strategies for Microgrids With Distributed Energy Storage Systems: An Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Control Strategies for Microgrids With Distributed Energy Storage Systems: An Overview","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779156/","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857374","htmlLink":"/document/7779156/","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Strategies for Microgrids With Distributed Energy Storage Systems: An Overview","sourcePdf":"tsg-morstyn-2637958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.241593S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7779156","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7779157,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Tai Do","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7779157/do-2638420-small.gif","p":["Tan Tai Do (S\u201908\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electronics and radio engineering from KyungHee University, South Korea, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, in 2015.

Various realistic assumptions are incorporated into the problem, which make the study valuable for performance assessment of real cellular networks to identify potentials for performance improvements in practical receiver designs. We assume that the continuous-time received signal is first discretized by mismatched filtering based on the imperfect CSIR. The resulting discrete-time signals are then decoded considering two different decoding strategies, i.e., an optimal decoding strategy based on specific statistics of channel estimation errors and a sub-optimal decoding strategy treating the estimation error signal as additive Gaussian noise. Motivated by the proposed decoding strategies, we study the performance of the decision feedback equalizer for finite constellation inputs, in which inter-stream interferences are treated either using their true statistics or as Gaussian noise. Numerical results are provided to exemplify the benefit of exploiting the knowledge on the statistics of the channel estimation errors and inter-stream interferences. Simulations also assess the effect of the CSI imperfectness on the achievable rate, which reveal that finite constellation inputs are less sensitive to the estimation accuracy than Gaussian input, especially in the high SNR regime.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07779157.pdf","startPage":"1107","endPage":"1119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2638420","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2638420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779157","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Channel estimation","Decoding","Estimation error","Uplink","Decision feedback equalizers","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","decoding","filtering theory","Gaussian noise","telecommunication channels","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["practical receiver designs","interstream interferences","decision feedback equalizer","additive Gaussian noise","estimation error signal","channel estimation errors","optimal decoding strategy","discrete-time signals","imperfect CSIR","mismatched filtering","continuous-time received signal","cellular networks","performance assessment","imperfect channel state information at the receiver","finite constellation input","uplink waveform channel capacity limit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite constellation input","imperfect CSI","mismatched filtering","uplink waveform channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Waveform Channel With Imperfect Channel State Information and Finite Constellation Input","accessionNumber":"16668640","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779157/","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2016R1C1B1014069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Waveform Channel With Imperfect Channel State Information and Finite Constellation Input","sourcePdf":"twc-do-2638420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119334S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7779157","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7779159,"authors":[{"name":"Nor Shahida Mohamad Yusop","affiliation":["Faculty of Science, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia","Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Science, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/8038906/7779159/moham-2638427-small.gif","p":["Nor Shahida Mohamad Yusop received the MSc degree in computer science\n - real time software engineering from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, in 2004.

No matter how they are discovered, these defects must be tracked and reported. However, empirical studies indicate that usability defects are often not clearly and fully described. This study aims to identify the state of the art in reporting of usability defects in the software engineering and usability engineering literature. We conducted a systematic literature review of usability defect reporting drawing from both the usability and software engineering literature from January 2000 until March 2016. As a result, a total of 57 studies were identified, in which we classified the studies into three categories: reporting usability defect information, analysing usability defect data and key challenges. Out of these, 20 were software engineering studies and 37 were usability studies. The results of this systematic literature review show that usability defect reporting processes suffer from a number of limitations, including: mixed data, inconsistency of terms and values of usability defect data, and insufficient attributes to classify usability defects. We make a number of recommendations to improve usability defect reporting and management in software engineering.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2016.2638427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/8038906/07779159.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2016.2638427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8038906","startPage":"848","endPage":"867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reporting Usability Defects: A Systematic Literature Review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reporting Usability Defects: A Systematic Literature Review","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17171544","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7779159/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000163","fundingName":"ARC Discovery projects scheme, the Deakin Software Technology Innovation Lab"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reporting Usability Defects: A Systematic Literature Review","sourcePdf":"tse-vasa-2638427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177374S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"8038906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8038906","articleId":"7779159","onlineDate":"09 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7779279,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Enrico de Falco","affiliation":["University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Paolo Enrico","lastName":"de Falco","id":"37086011814"},{"name":"James Birchall","affiliation":["University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Birchall","id":"37298545800"},{"name":"Laurence Smith","affiliation":["University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Laurence","lastName":"Smith","id":"37086210067"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7779279","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"abstract":"The single-ended RF power amplifier (PA) is a standard design approach in the RF engineer's tool kit, but high efficiency and good linearity may only be achieved if the harmonic terminations and biasing conditions are carefully examined. This is demonstrated in a single-ended PA using class-AB \"sweet spots\" and an optimized third harmonic termination, which won first place at the 2016 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) International Microwave Symposium's high-efficiency PA student design competition, sponsored by Technical Committee MTT-5. A linear, single-ended PA operating at 3 GHz was designed by exploiting the sweet spots present in class-AB amplifier responses and optimizing the third-harmonic termination. The improvements to PAE and IMD3 from the third-harmonic tuning are clear from the simulation results, and the class-AB sweet spots were shown in both simulation and measurement. The actual measured performance was 44% two-tone PAE at -30 dBc IMD3, giving a FOM of 58.8; this is a good result considering the variable-envelope signal used, which supports the proposed methodology. While the PA was unable to reach the outstanding FOM performance shown in previous years, the single-ended design is simpler and more cost effective than a linear DPA. The good agreement seen between the simulation results and measured data also demonstrates the value of the design method when applied through the use of suitable CAD tools.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Power amplifiers","Harmonic analysis","Power generation","Load modeling","Solid modeling","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","microwave power amplifiers","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency power amplifier","single-ended RF power amplifier","RF engineer tool kit","harmonic terminations","biasing conditions","class-AB sweet spots","2016 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","International Microwave Symposium","high-efficiency PA student design competition","technical committee MTT-5","class-AB amplifier","third-harmonic tuning","variable-envelope signal","CAD tools","frequency 3 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MMM.2016.2616183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/7779182/07779279.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2016.2616183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hitting the Sweet Spot: A Single-Ended Power Amplifier Exploiting Class AB Sweet Spots and Optimized Third Harmonic Termination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hitting the Sweet Spot: A Single-Ended Power Amplifier Exploiting Class AB Sweet Spots and Optimized Third Harmonic Termination","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779279/","volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779279/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16524221","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hitting the Sweet Spot: A Single-Ended Power Amplifier Exploiting Class AB Sweet Spots and Optimized Third Harmonic Termination","sourcePdf":"18mmm01-defalco-2616183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03697S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"7779182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7779182","articleId":"7779279","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7779280,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Palazzi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Palazzi","id":"37085431793"},{"name":"Massimo Del Prete","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Del Prete","id":"37085394914"},{"name":"Marco Fantuzzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Fantuzzi","id":"37085379680"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7779280","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2379},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectennas","Rectifiers","Bandwidth","Broadband antennas","Impedance","Reflection coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","energy harvesting","radiotelephony","rectennas","rectifiers","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy scavenging","rectenna design","wireless energy harvesting","UHF mobile telephony bands","distributed electronic devices","ubiquitous electronic devices","home automation","intelligent transportation systems","personal entertainment","health-care applications","noninvasive biomedical parameter monitoring","industrial applications","military applications","commercial telephony frequency","broadband slot antenna","thin flexible substrate","rectifier design","matching network"]}],"abstract":"The development of distributed and ubiquitous electronic devices is an achievement of modern technology that has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of human life.

The system, being based on a broadband slot antenna and a thin flexible substrate, weighs fewer than 15 g, which is far below the competition requirements and makes the harvester particularly appealing for realistic scenarios.

We investigate the most difficult and important problem where all the users have the same power constraint and the same rate. For the case of 2 users we use a known scheme and analyze it by means of simulations. We found the optimal relation between the number of inner and outer iterations. We further extend the scheme for the case of any number of users and investigated the cases of 3 and 4 users by means of simulations.

Maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm for SCMA detection has very high complexity and can not be implemented in real-time applications. Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) has smaller complexity, but it is still high. In this paper, we propose a new SCMA detector for AWGN channel which complexity is smaller than that of simplified log-domain MPA. This algorithm is based on antipodal symmetry of codewords in codebooks. Because of this property decoding process is reduced to the solution of a small number of overdetermined systems of linear equations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is equivalent to Max-Log-MPA with 2-3 iterations. The implementation of the algorithm is well parallelized, calculations of inverse matrices are performed in advance and obtained results are stored in memory, i. e. operations with very high computational complexity need not be performed in real-time application.","doi":"10.1109/RED.2016.7779331","publicationTitle":"2016 XV International Symposium Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems (REDUNDANCY)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XV International Symposium Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems (REDUNDANCY)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756108/7779315/07779331.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RED.2016.7779331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity SCMA detector for AWGN channel based on solving overdetermined systems of linear equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779331/","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity SCMA detector for AWGN channel based on solving overdetermined systems of linear equations","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779331/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525195","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity SCMA detector for AWGN channel based on solving overdetermined systems of linear equations","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"Kli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055984S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756108","isNumber":"7779315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756108","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7779315","articleId":"7779331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779333,"authors":[{"name":"Evgenii Krouk","affiliation":["Saint-Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation, Saint-Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Evgenii","lastName":"Krouk","id":"37326370600"},{"name":"Andrei Ovchinnikov","affiliation":["Saint-Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation, Saint-Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Ovchinnikov","id":"37837453800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4231-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4230-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4232-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779333","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779333","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Generators","Redundancy","Public key cryptography","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["private key cryptography","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permutation preserving code","equivalent code generator matrices","McEliece cryptosystem","one-structural attack"]}],"abstract":"In this paper an attack on McEliece cryptosystem is considered.

Actually, receiving side usually estimates channel state using special pilot elements incorporated into the signal structure. Transmission of these redundant pilot signals requires extra power and time-frequency resource, that reduces spectral and energy efficiency of the communication system, so the number of pilots should be minimized. The paper describes two views on the reception of short data packets transmitted using quadrature amplitude modulation. On the one hand, coherent reception with semi-blind channel estimation is considered, namely, signal level and phase offset estimation is performed by blind algorithms using all symbols of the packet, and pilot symbols are only used to resolve ambiguity inherent for blind estimates of phase offset. On the other hand, the whole packet can be treated as a signal from a signal set suitable for noncoherent reception. High-correlation approximation for bit error probability is evaluated and compared with results obtained for coherent reception with channel estimation. Computer simulation showed that even for moderately short QAM packets bit error probability for semi-blind channel estimation is close to achievable limits for noncoherent reception of the packet as a whole with a loss about 0.4 dB.","doi":"10.1109/RED.2016.7779348","publicationTitle":"2016 XV International Symposium Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems (REDUNDANCY)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 XV International Symposium Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems (REDUNDANCY)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7756108/7779315/07779348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RED.2016.7779348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779315","startPage":"137","endPage":"141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-blind approach to reception of short QAM data packets with pilot symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semi-blind approach to reception of short QAM data packets with pilot symbols","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779348/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525169","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7779348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-blind approach to reception of short QAM data packets with pilot symbols","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"Ser.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048042S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7756108","isNumber":"7779315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7756108","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7779315","articleId":"7779348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779358,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Zhilin","affiliation":["Inst. for Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Zhilin","id":"38494236900"},{"name":"Alexey Kreschuk","affiliation":["Inst. for Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Kreschuk","id":"37085999591"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4231-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4230-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4232-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779358","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Redundancy","Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Complexity theory","Concatenated codes","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error correction codes","flash memories","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","BCH code","error correction code","NAND-flash memory","optical channels","generalized concatenated code constructions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779358","abstract":"We propose an error-correcting code construction that allows constructing codes with low overhead (less than 20%) and long length (10000 bits and more) that have good error correction performance and relatively low decoding complexity.

However, a lot of time is consumed in execution and learning from the humongous datasets. In the last decade General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) have revolutionized the computing industry by their capability to process data in parallel and hence speedup the entire process. This paper aims to showcase a generic model which can be used as a reference to convert implementations of serial machine learning algorithms to parallel implementations. Because of varying types of machine learning algorithms, the model was developed with a broad mindset to support most of them. After development, for the purpose of testing the correctness of the model, a few machine learning algorithms of different kinds are experimented with. They were processed step-by-step in accordance with the model and their original serial implementations in C and the resultant parallel implementations in CUDA were compared w.r.t. the computation time. Also, the serial implementations and parallel implementations were mapped to check if they gave the exact same results i.e. whether perfectly correct parallelism was obtained. The results obtained showed that the model when used for parallelization, gave absolutely correct parallel implementations, without any losses due to parallelization. The model gave highly efficient outcomes for non-neural network based supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with a speedup of 146\u00d7 achieved in K-NN algorithm and 75\u00d7 achieved in K-Means algorithm. The model also gave a correct parallel implementation for Backpropagation algorithm, however here the parallel implementation could not execute faster than the serial implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764574/7779360/07779378.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS)","doi":"10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revolutionizing machine learning algorithms using GPUs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Acceleration","Robots","Irrigation","Hardware","Optimization","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","graphics processing units","parallel architectures","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","general purpose graphics processing units","GPGPU","parallel data processing","serial machine learning algorithms","CUDA","nonneural network based unsupervised learning","K-NN algorithm","K-Means algorithm","parallel implementation","backpropagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["backpropogation","graphics processing unit (GPU)","K-means","K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)","machine learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Revolutionizing machine learning algorithms using GPUs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779378/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525788","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revolutionizing machine learning algorithms using GPUs","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"A119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092879S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764574","isNumber":"7779360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764574","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7779360","articleId":"7779378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779434,"authors":[{"name":"Ayush Kapoor","affiliation":["VI Semester, Sir MVIT, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Ayush","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37086207956"},{"name":"Suchetha I Bhat","affiliation":["CSE Department, Sir MVIT, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Suchetha I","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37086200992"},{"name":"Sushila Shidnal","affiliation":["VI Semester, Sir MVIT, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Sushila","lastName":"Shidnal","id":"37085831570"},{"name":"Akshay Mehra","affiliation":["VI Semester, Sir MVIT, Bangalore"],"firstName":"Akshay","lastName":"Mehra","id":"37086207116"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1022-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1020-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1021-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1023-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779434","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4027},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MATLAB","Sensors","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agricultural engineering","crops","environmental factors","fertilisers","image processing","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","environmental factor","man-made factor","IoT sensing network","leaf lattice","MATLAB software","histogram analysis","agriculture","Internet of Things","smart agriculture","pesticides","fertilizers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things (IoT)","Image Processing","Sensing network","MATLAB"]}],"abstract":"Internet of Things and Image processing have been so far been applied for various applications independently.

Using an IoT sensing network which takes the readings of the crucial environmental factors and the image of the leaf lattice, it is processed under MATLAB software by the help of histogram analysis to arrive at conclusive results.","doi":"10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779434","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764574/7779360/07779434.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) and Image processing in smart agriculture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779434/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) and Image processing in smart agriculture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16525773","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779434/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) and Image processing in smart agriculture","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"S105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031069S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764574","isNumber":"7779360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764574","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7779360","articleId":"7779434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779461,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongwen Li","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongwen","lastName":"Li","id":"37085669091"},{"name":"Chuanzhi Zang","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chuanzhi","lastName":"Zang","id":"37085622656"},{"name":"Peng Zeng","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37313616100"},{"name":"Haibin Yu","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086086131"},{"name":"Jing Bian","affiliation":["Lab. of Networked Control Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Jing Bian","id":"37085758218"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779461","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Lenses","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","distributed power generation","hierarchical systems","optimal control","power generation control","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power generation reliability","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["islanded microgrid","renewable energy source","RES","hierarchical strategy","ED","economic dispatch","AGC","MG economic efficiency decrement","distributed optimal automatic generation control","OAGC algorithm","local measurement","single point failure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed algorithm","droop control","Microgrid","multi-agent system (MAS)","optimal automatic generation control (OAGC)"]}],"abstract":"Microgrids (MGs) have been receiving more and more attention, as it can environmentally and reliably integrate intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). Conventionally, an islanded MG is controlled and optimized in a hierarchical strategy, i.e., primary droop control, second automatic generation control (AGC), and tertiary economic dispatch (ED). ED has large time-scale while AGC has small time-scale. Thus the gap between ED and AGC may decrease the economic efficiency of a MG. In this paper, a distributed optimal automatic generation control (OAGC) algorithm is proposed to integrate the gap between ED and AGC, i.e., the MG can realize AGC and ED at the same time. In order to implement the OAGC algorithm, each DG is assigned with an agent and the agents only require the local measurements and communicate with its neighbors. The proposed OAGC algorithm is fully distributed, which involves low costs related to modify the architecture of a MG and robust against single point failure. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779461","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764660/7779453/07779461.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully distributed optimal automatic generation control for an islanded microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fully distributed optimal automatic generation control for an islanded microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779461/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16526501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779461/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully distributed optimal automatic generation control for an islanded microgrids","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"A1-O-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074348S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764660","isNumber":"7779453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764660","xplore-issue":"7779453","articleId":"7779461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7779473,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshitha Naranpanawe","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Lakshitha","lastName":"Naranpanawe","id":"37086107413"},{"name":"Tapan Saha","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Tapan","lastName":"Saha","id":"37275926200"},{"name":"Chandima Ekanayake","affiliation":["Gold Coast Campus, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia"],"firstName":"Chandima","lastName":"Ekanayake","id":"37403460100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779473","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Clamps","Fluctuations","Moisture","Steel","Temperature sensors","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","moisture","power transformers","temperature","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moisture effects","temperature effects","power transformer winding clamping pressure","finite element modelling","mechanical properties","field-installed autotransformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-density pressboard","Moisture","Progressive loss of winding clamping pressure","Temperature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779473","abstract":"This paper presents findings from a finite element modelling based simulation study conducted to understand the moisture and temperature dependency of power transformer winding clamping pressure.

Various type of programming optimization techniques are frequently used to find best optimal relay settings of over-current relays in modern distribution systems. The goal of this paper is to discuss optimization of over-current relays coordination for internal faults protection over transmission lines in radial network via Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is one of the capable heuristic techniques to solve constrained optimization problems. PSO algorithm objective is to achieve proper coordination between each main and its back-up relays. Based on the variables obtained during normal operation and three phases' faults conditions from DigSILENT software simulation on IEEE 15 nodes radial system, PSO algorithm is applied to properly identify suitable relays settings namely Time Multiplier Setting (TMS) and Plug Setting (PS) for all Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) over-current relays. The collected data are conveniently examined using the PSO algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The obtained TMS and PS settings of each relay show the effectiveness of the proposed PSO technique in terms of accuracy and speed in a large scale radial network configuration.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779575","startPage":"604","endPage":"608","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779453","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764660/7779453/07779575.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The optimal coordination of over-current relay protection in radial network based on Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779575/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The optimal coordination of over-current relay protection in radial network based on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779575/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16540995","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The optimal coordination of over-current relay protection in radial network based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"D4-O-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071663S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764660","isNumber":"7779453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764660","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7779453","articleId":"7779575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7779577,"authors":[{"name":"Ke-yan Liu","affiliation":["Power Distribution Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ke-yan Liu","id":"37079967200"},{"name":"Wanxing Sheng","affiliation":["Power Distribution Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wanxing Sheng","id":"37290204700"},{"name":"Yongmei Liu","affiliation":["Power Distribution Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yongmei Liu","id":"37086081344"},{"name":"Feng Gao","affiliation":["Ningxia Electric Power Research Institute, Yinchuan, Ningxia Province, China"],"lastName":"Feng Gao","id":"37086080084"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779577","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving coordinated voltage optimization in distribution network based on a robust sequential quadratic programming algorithm","abstract":"This paper investigates the optimal operation problem for distribution networks with the integration of distributed generation (DG).

From the points of the transmission network, a VSC-HVDC in electric power network influences the two end nodes' injection power of DC transmission line virtually and the injection power will further influence the distribution of branch power. The elimination of overload in electric power network that caused by VSC-HVDC has been considered when making transmission network expansion planning. A fast optimization model for power of transmission network including VSC-HVDC is built to minimize the network power loss. A new genetic operation called shift operation which will change the order of chromosome's local coding is added to the algorithm to keep the diversity of population. Garver-6 system is taken as an example to verify the correctness of the fast optimization model and prove that the genetic algorithm with shift operation can avoid local convergence more effectively. The genetic algorithm with shift operation is a beneficial attempt to improve the global convergence of genetic algorithm. The fast optimization model for power of transmission network including VSC-HVDC is proved to be

It is effective to apply the Long Short-Term Memory model to the field of wind power prediction.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779672","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1152","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764660/7779453/07779672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term prediction of wind power based on deep Long Short-Term Memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Wind power generation","Data models","Principal component analysis","Machine learning","Training","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","numerical analysis","power engineering computing","principal component analysis","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term wind power prediction","deep long short-term memory model","wind power prediction model","deep learning method","mass data generalization","principal component analysis","PCA","LSTM prediction model","numerical weather prediction","NWP","BP neural network","support vector machine model","SVM model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","Long Short-Term Memory","numerical weather prediction","principal component analysis","wind power prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-term prediction of wind power based on deep Long Short-Term Memory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16540827","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7779672/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779672/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term prediction of wind power based on deep Long Short-Term Memory","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"P2-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054935S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764660","isNumber":"7779453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764660","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7779453","articleId":"7779672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779769,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqing Wei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Intelligent Dispatch and Control of Ministry of Education (Shandong University) Shandong, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Zhiqing Wei","id":"37087617532"},{"name":"Mengxia Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Intelligent Dispatch and Control of Ministry of Education (Shandong University) Shandong, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Mengxia Wang","id":"37087683640"},{"name":"Xueshan Han","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Intelligent Dispatch and Control of Ministry of Education (Shandong University) Shandong, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Xueshan Han","id":"37087338443"},{"name":"Haicheng Zhang","affiliation":["Binzhou Power Supply Company of State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company Shandong, Binzhou, China"],"lastName":"Haicheng Zhang","id":"37087464515"},{"name":"Qiang Zhang","affiliation":["Shandong Electric Power Dispatching and Control Center Shandong, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Zhang","id":"37087251485"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779769","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779769","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Conductors","Wind forecasting","Probabilistic logic","Power transmission lines","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","power generation dispatch","power overhead lines","power system measurement","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic forecast method","quantile regression method","dynamic thermal rating","DTR technology","overhead power transmission lines","probability distribution function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["capacity forecast","dynamic line rating","overhead line","probability distribution function","quantile regression"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic thermal rating (DTR) is an effective technique to improve the ampacity of overhead power transmission lines based on the monitoring of real-time environmental conditions. With DTR technology being introduced, the thermal rating of transmission line is no longer constant but time-dependent. To fully utilize the transfer capability of transmission lines, it is necessary to provide operators with probabilistic forecasting information of DTR to make dispatch decision. In this paper, a new probabilistic forecast method based on the quantile regression analysis theory is proposed to realize the probabilistic prediction of DTR. The weather parameters which have significant influence on the real-time ampacity and historical line ratings are embedded in the quantile regression prediction model. The proposed method can not only give the point prediction and interval prediction result, but also can provide the forecasting results of probability distribution function. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is illustrated by case studies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779769","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764660/7779453/07779769.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1635","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic forecasting for the ampacity of overhead transmission lines using quantile regression method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic forecasting for the ampacity of overhead transmission lines using quantile regression method","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7779769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16540910","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779769/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic forecasting for the ampacity of overhead transmission lines using quantile regression method","confLoc":"Xi'an","sourcePdf":"P3-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045259S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764660","isNumber":"7779453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764660","xplore-issue":"7779453","articleId":"7779769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7779793,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxue Rong","affiliation":["Ji'nan Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Ji'nan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"Rong","id":"37085994176"},{"name":"Bo Wang","affiliation":["Ji'nan Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Ji'nan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089060984"},{"name":"Chuanjun Shao","affiliation":["Ji'nan Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Ji'nan, China"],"firstName":"Chuanjun","lastName":"Shao","id":"37085993786"},{"name":"Guangyuan Yu","affiliation":["Ji'nan Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Ji'nan, China"],"firstName":"Guangyuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085991983"},{"name":"Yan'an Wang","affiliation":["Ji'nan Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Ji'nan, China"],"firstName":"Yan'an","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089065825"},{"name":"Qiming Sun","affiliation":["Ji'nan Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Ji'nan, China"],"firstName":"Qiming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085989975"},{"name":"Zhaohong Bie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohong","lastName":"Bie","id":"37281856700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Substations","Charging stations","Mathematical model","Power grids","Optimization","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle charging","genetic algorithms","load flow","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated charging","electric vehicle charging station","linear power flow","genetic algorithm","electric vehicles","EV charging station","EV batteries","substation","switching station","power flow linearization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coordinated charging strategy","electric vehicle","linear power flow","power network limits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779793","abstract":"To reduce the negative effects caused by electric vehicles (EVs), this paper proposes a coordinated charging strategy for batteries in EV charging station.

Different from traditional signal acquisition processing methods, compressed sensing is a promising method being widely used in emerging areas such as image processing, biotechnology, and communication, etc. This method significantly reduces the sampling rate at signal acquisition, and the compressed signals can be recovered in an accurate way. Numerous studies illustrate that conventional compressed sensing is effectively used in the static system. However, the delay of the static system is very large, which restricts its application in highly real-time control applications. With the continuous expansion of smart grid, electric power department needs to adjust the price and other controllable variables in real-time to accommodate the electric consumption of residents. Increasing demand of real-time control strategy with fast, reliable and stable properties becomes the core issue that need to be solved urgently. Simulation results verify that the proposed strategy can recover signal in real-time effectively using less amount of data through a dynamic sliding window.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779795","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764660/7779453/07779795.pdf","startPage":"1782","endPage":"1786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing based real-time control in a smart grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779795/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing based real-time control in a smart grid","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16540956","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7779795/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing based real-time control in a smart grid","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"P4-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107756S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764660","isNumber":"7779453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764660","xplore-issue":"7779453","articleId":"7779795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7779832,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xu","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085551507"},{"name":"Haihong Yu","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haihong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086192616"},{"name":"Yi Lu","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085554859"},{"name":"Peng Qiu","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086189807"},{"name":"Kai Tong","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Tong","id":"37086193162"},{"name":"Jiazhuo Xuan","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiazhuo","lastName":"Xuan","id":"37086188649"},{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086190582"},{"name":"Xiaoming Huang","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086190275"},{"name":"Daozhuo Jiang","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Daozhuo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37275554300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779832","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HVDC transmission","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Switches","Topology","Hybrid power systems","Arresters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","fault location","HVDC power transmission","insulated gate bipolar transistors","investment","power grids","power transmission control","power transmission economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault analysis","HVDC breaker topology","HVDC breaker control","HVDC systems","H-bridge type HVDC breaker","fault isolation strategies","negative poles","positive poles","hybrid HVDC breaker","current flow direction characteristics","IGBT","fault clearing capability","investment cost","three-terminal monopolar HVDC grid","PSCAD/EMTDC modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H-bridge type HVDC breaker","fault isolation","current interrupting capacity","economy","HVDC gird"]}],"abstract":"In order to reduce the cost of the expensive hybrid HVDC breaker, a H-bridge type HVDC breaker is proposed in this paper, and different fault isolation strategies are studied in the combination of positive and negative poles.

modeling strategy","abstract":"This paper develops a customized residential load scheduling system to minimize electricity expenditure through optimizing the switching-on times of large energy-consuming appliances. Probability model of scheduled appliance is extracted from smart meter measurements using kernel density estimation method. Constrained switching-on time intervals as well as operation parameters of the appliance are then derived from the probability model. With time constraint and operation parameters, load scheduling is executed by solving a constraint optimization problem to minimize electricity expenditure under time-of-use tariff. The data-drive modeling strategy enables the load scheduling system to be adaptive to the diversity of residential customers. A customized time schedule thus can be produced in order to maximize economic benefits while meet the comfort requirement of residential customer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7779841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7779841/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16526478","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Customized residential load scheduling based on data-driven appliance modeling strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customized residential load scheduling based on data-driven appliance modeling strategy","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"P5-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047359S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764660","isNumber":"7779453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764660","xplore-issue":"7779453","articleId":"7779841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7779863,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Operation and Control of Renewable Energy & Storage Systems, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haiyan Tang","id":"37087315889"},{"name":"Wei He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wei He","id":"37087792810"},{"name":"Yongning Chi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Operation and Control of Renewable Energy & Storage Systems, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yongning Chi","id":"37087790397"},{"name":"Xinshou Tian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Operation and Control of Renewable Energy & Storage Systems, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xinshou Tian","id":"37087792303"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Operation and Control of Renewable Energy & Storage Systems, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Li","id":"37087265180"},{"name":"Yukun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Operation and Control of Renewable Energy & Storage Systems, China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yukun Wang","id":"37088017639"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5418-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5419-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7779863","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":451},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Voltage control","Damping","Stators","Wind farms","Rotors","Wind power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","compensation","damping","optimal control","power capacitors","power convertors","power generation control","power grids","rotors","stators","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC capacitor voltage dynamic characteristics","stator-side active power","rotor-side active power","transfer characteristics","optimal control","grid side converter control","series compensation","wind farm","doubly-fed induction generator","wind power integrated system","subsynchronous oscillation phenomena","wind power penetration","damping control","DFIG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFIG","sub-synchronous oscillation","grid side converter","additional control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7779863","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779453","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764660/7779453/07779863.pdf","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of grid side converter of DFIG on sub-synchronous oscillation and its damping control","abstract":"Along with the increasing of wind power penetration, the sub-synchronous oscillation phenomena may happen in wind power integrated system.
