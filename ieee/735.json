In this paper a pilot protection scheme, known as permissive overreaching transfer trip, is used. This structure combine two different protection relays: directional overcurrent relay, a backup protection for phase-earth faults, and distance relay for phase-phase faults. An intelligent method was developed to the optimal coordination of protection relays in meshed networks like transmission networks. The proposed method employs the genetic algorithm as optimization procedure that considers network characteristics (maximum load current and minimum fault current) and adjustment parameters of overcurrent and distance relays. Two testing networks, one of 8-bus and other of 39-bus, were used to evaluate the proposed method that obtained feasible and good solutions for the coordination problem.","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2015.7350048","startPage":"2975","endPage":"2982","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel7/9907/7350023/07350048.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2015.7350048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Coordination of Overcurrent Directional and Distance Relays in Meshed Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Protective relaying","Biological system modeling","IEC","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","overcurrent protection","power transmission faults","power transmission lines","power transmission protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent method","phase-phase faults","phase earth faults","backup protection","directional overcurrent relay","protection relays","pilot protection scheme","power system operation","transmission lines protection","genetic algorithm","meshed networks","distance relays","optimal coordination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Modeling of numerical relay","Optimal coordination","Overcurrent and distance relays","Power system protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Coordination of Overcurrent Directional and Distance Relays in Meshed Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","volume":"13","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15676991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Coordination of Overcurrent Directional and Distance Relays in Meshed Networks Using Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"13TLA9_25Marcolino.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040781S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","isNumber":"7350023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"6","articleId":"7350048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7350094,"authors":[{"name":"Remus Narcis Beres","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7394954/7350094/beres-2507203-small.gif","p":["Remus Narcis Beres (S\u201913) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Transilvania University of Brasov, Brasov, Romania, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree in wind power systems from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in power filters.","He was with Distribution Network Operator, Electrica Distribution South Transylvania, Brasov, from 2010 to 2011.

However, the filter resonance peaks may require the use of passive dampers to stabilize the interactions between the load and source impedances. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect is more difficult to be guaranteed for cost-optimized filters, which are characterized by low-inductance and high-capacitance passive components. In this paper, several passive filter topologies used to interface voltage-source converters with the utility grid are reviewed and evaluated in terms of damping capability, stored energy in the passive components, and power loss in the damping circuit. In addition, the influences of different switching frequencies of power converters on the passive filter design are discussed in the range 1-15 kHz. Illustrative design examples of the passive filters and experimental data are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2507203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/7394954/07350094.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2507203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Passive Power Filters for Three-Phase Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Passive Power Filters for Three-Phase Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350094/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15754612","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350094/","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Program (FP/2007-2013)/ERC","grantNumber":"321149-Harmony"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Review of Passive Power Filters for Three-Phase Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters","sourcePdf":"jestpe-beres-2507203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204254S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7394954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"7394954","articleId":"7350094","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7350096,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Xi","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xi","id":"37399891500"},{"name":"Jun Zhao","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37405211200"},{"name":"James R.

Methods: In an ideal CT-MRI scanner, CT and MRI acquisitions would occur simultaneously, and would be inherently registered in space and time. Alternatively, separately acquired CT and MRI scans can be fused to simulate an instantaneous acquisition. In this study, structural coupling and compressive sensing techniques are combined to unify CT and MRI reconstructions. A bidirectional image estimation method was proposed to connect images from different modalities. Hence, CT and MRI data serve as prior knowledge to each other for better CT and MRI image reconstruction than what could be achieved with separate reconstruction. Significance: Combined CT-MRI imaging has the potential for improved results in existing preclinical and clinical applications, as well as opening novel research directions for future applications. Results: Our integrated reconstruction methodology is demonstrated with numerical phantom and real-dataset-based experiments, and has yielded promising results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7471384/07350096.pdf","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2487779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2487779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7471384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous CT-MRI Reconstruction for Constrained Imaging Geometries Using Structural Coupling and Compressive Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image reconstruction","Estimation","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","computerised tomography","image reconstruction","image registration","medical image processing","phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous CT-MRI image reconstruction","unified reconstruction framework","CT-MRI scanner","MRI acquisitions","CT acquisitions","constrained imaging geometry","structural coupling","compressive sensing","computed tomography","magnetic resonance imaging","bidirectional image estimation method","numerical phantom","real-dataset-based experiments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computed Tomography","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Compressed Sensing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Phantoms, Imaging","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]},{"kwd":["Compressed sensing","computed tomography (CT)","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous CT-MRI Reconstruction for Constrained Imaging Geometries Using Structural Coupling and Compressive Sensing","volume":"63","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7350096/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16002623","pubMedId":"26672028","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000050","fundingName":"NHLBI","grantNumber":"HL098912"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"813716234"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2010CB834302"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical Engineering Cross Research","grantNumber":"YG2014ZD05 and YG2013MS30"},{"fundingName":"CT Department of Public Health","grantNumber":"#2011-0139 and #2015-1169"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009429","fundingName":"NRSA","grantNumber":"T32HL098069"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous CT-MRI Reconstruction for Constrained Imaging Geometries Using Structural Coupling and Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"tbme-wang-2487779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079701S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7471384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7471384","articleId":"7350096","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7350097,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Martin Ibanez","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Department, Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones T\u00e9cnicas de Gipuzkoa, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7526337/7350097/ibane-2506462-small.gif","p":["Federico Martin Ibanez was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1982.

A comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon in the timedomain and in the state plane is presented. Based on the latter, an expression that estimates m and shows the influences of the parameters is obtained. With the aid of this expression, a solution that mitigates that effect is presented and implemented in a prototype, which is part of a bidirectional power chain for supercapacitors.

A new computing architecture called Ising computing and implemented using CMOS circuits is proposed. This computing maps the problems to an Ising model, a model to express the behavior of magnetic spins, and solves combinatorial optimization problems efficiently exploiting its intrinsic convergence properties. In the computing, \u201cCMOS annealing\u201d is used to find a better solution for the problems. A 20k-spin prototype Ising chip is fabricated in 65 nm process. The Ising chip achieves 100 MHz operation and its capability of solving combinatorial optimization problems using an Ising model is confirmed. The power efficiency of the chip can be estimated to be 1800 times higher than that of a general purpose CPU when running an approximation algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685055","htmlLink":"/document/7350099/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 20k-Spin Ising Chip to Solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems With CMOS Annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 20k-Spin Ising Chip to Solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems With CMOS Annealing","sourcePdf":"jssc-yamaoka-2498601-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062626S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7368951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7368951","articleId":"7350099","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350103,"authors":[{"name":"Zunaira Babar","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Zunaira","lastName":"Babar","id":"37070429400"},{"name":"Panagiotis Botsinis","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Botsinis","id":"38667372100"},{"name":"Dimitrios Alanis","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Alanis","id":"37085567135"},{"name":"Soon Xin Ng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Soon","lastName":"Xin Ng","id":"37273462100"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7350103","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350103","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Cascading style sheets","Phase change materials","Bismuth","Error correction codes","Decoding","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","parity check codes","quantum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum LDPC codes","row-circulant quasi-cyclic low-density parity check matrices","nondual-containing Calderbank-Shor-Steane-type quantum low-density parity check codes","balanced incomplete block design-based row-circulant QC-LDPC codes","entanglement-assisted-QLDPC code","quantum error correction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Error Correction","Low Density Parity Check Codes","Iterative Decoding"]},{"kwd":["Quantum error correction","low density parity check codes","iterative decoding"]}],"abstract":"Classical row-circulant quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity check (LDPC) matrices are known to generate efficient high-rate short and moderate-length QC-LDPC codes, while the comparable random structures exhibit numerous short cycles of length-4.

The need for a highly accurate indoor positioning system is rapidly increasing. In the past couple of years, several positioning systems based on visible light communications that achieve good positioning accuracy have been proposed. Some of these systems are based on assumptions such as complete knowledge of the height of the receiver, and exact alignment of the transmitter and receiver normals to the normal of the ceiling. Some other systems do not support user mobility because they require a user to vary the receiver orientation at a fixed location. Another common assumption is that the transmitters are at the same height from the ground. In order to support user mobility, this paper proposes a novel positioning system using multiple optical receivers that provides coordinates and an orientation of the mobile receiver. The remarkable features of the system are as follows: 1) the receiver can be mobile; 2) the positioning is done within 2.5 ms in our experimental setup; 3) the heights of the transmitters need not be the same; 4) the receiver's height need not be known; and 5) the receiver's normal need not be aligned with those of the transmitters. Experimental results show that mean position errors of less than 0.06 m is achievable even when the average receiver speed is 1.3 m/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15, 15 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350107/","volume":"34","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7350107/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15786204","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Position Tracking Using Multiple Optical Receivers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","grantNumber":"VTC 2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Position Tracking Using Multiple Optical Receivers","sourcePdf":"jlt-yasir-2507182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06821S","chronDate":"Feb.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7404301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7404301","articleId":"7350107","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7350109,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Morant","affiliation":["Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Maria Morant (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912) received the M.Sc. degree\n in telecommunication engineering in 2008 and the International Ph.D. degree from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de\n Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain, in 2012.

The experimental test-bed comprises a 150-m optical fronthaul of four-core homogeneous MCF, which can be configured with different bending radius for analysis. Performance of linear crosstalk in MCF media is evaluated by simulation and validated by the experimental work in the laboratory with the radio-over-fiber transmission of full-standard LTE-A wireless signals considering both SISO and MIMO configurations. The optical fronthaul analysis evaluates both same-propagation and counter-propagation spatial multiplexing, i.e., all cores propagating in the same direction and two versus two cores propagating in opposite directions, corresponding to a dual LTE-A roof-mounted system. The performance of the MCF optical fronthaul system is evaluated using a single 20-MHz LTE-A carrier and also carrier-aggregated signals with 16QAM and 64QAM subcarrier modulation. The experimental results indicate that intercore crosstalk (IC-XT) increases up to 9.6 dB when raising the bending radius from 35 to 67 cm, being the bending radius a key parameter in MCF fronthaul systems. The demonstration performed at 1550.12 nm reported an increase of IC-XT of 4.6 dB with the bending radius, which deteriorates the quality of the SISO LTE-A signal up to 8.1 dB error vector magnitude (EVM). This IC-XT impairment can be mitigated using 2\u00d72 MIMO processing, which reduces the EVM impact to less than 1 dB when increasing the MCF bending radius from 35 to 67 cm. The experimental results indicate that 3GPP MIMO LTE-A algorithms already in-place in the wireless LTE-A standard can be used to compensate the IC-XT in the 150-m multicore optical fronthaul system with spatial multiplexing.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2507137","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7405362/07350109.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2507137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Suitability of Multicore Fiber for LTE\u2013Advanced MIMO Optical Fronthaul Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Suitability of Multicore Fiber for LTE\u2013Advanced MIMO Optical Fronthaul Systems","volume":"34","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15786103","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350109/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350109/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spain the National Plan Projects HIDRASENSE","grantNumber":"RTC-2014\u20132232\u20133"},{"fundingName":"MODAL","grantNumber":"TEC2012\u201338558-C02\u201301"},{"fundingName":"UPV postdoc PAID-10\u201314"},{"fundingName":"F.P.I.","grantNumber":"BES-2013\u2013062952"},{"fundingName":"Programa de Valoraci\u00f3n y Recursos Conjuntos de I+D+I VLC/CAMPUS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001700","fundingName":"Spain Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Suitability of Multicore Fiber for LTE\u2013Advanced MIMO Optical Fronthaul Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-morant-2507137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063186S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7405362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7405362","articleId":"7350109","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7350112,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey S.

Here, we propose a planar solution realized with a single multi-layer PCB, with consequent reduction in cost and complexity of the array. It consists of an array of connected slots backed by a metallic reflector and loaded with superstrates. Artificial dielectric layers (ADLs) are used in place of real dielectrics to realize the superstrates, as they are characterized by very low surface-wave losses. For the unit-cell design, we developed an analysis tool based on closed-form expressions and thus requiring minimal computational resources. Finite-array simulations are also performed by generalizing the analysis method to account for the truncation effects. The presence of the ADL superstrate allows reducing the distance between the array plane and the backing reflector while maintaining good matching performance. A realistic feed structure is also proposed, which consists of a microstrip line connected to a coaxial feed. Such a solution does not require balanced-to-unbalanced transitions, which often limit the achievable bandwidth. The proposed structure achieves in simulations more than an octave bandwidth (6.5-14.5 GHz), within a scanning range of \u00b150\u00b0 in all azimuth planes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband,

based on microstrip magnetic dipole is presented in this communication. Microstrip magnetic dipoles are employed as the driven elements in the phased array. Meanwhile, coupling patches are embedded between the adjacent driven elements, and coupling energy is transferred between driven elements by the coupling patches. Strong coupling has been constructed between elements as the driven element spacing is only about 0.35 \u03bb . With the influence of adjacent elements, the 3-dB beamwidth (BW) of each active element can reach over \u00b180\u00b0 in the elevation plane. From simulation and measurement, the main lobe scanning ranges of an 8-element and a 16-element phased arrays can both extend over \u00b180\u00b0 in the elevation plane with a gain fluctuation less than 3 dB. Furthermore, in order to keep the SLL low in the scanning, especially at the low elevation angles, genetic algorithm (GA) has been used, and the SLL has been decreased to the value of -9 dB in the full scanning range of \u00b177\u00b0 for the eight-element array.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wide-Angle Scanning and Low Sidelobe Level Microstrip Phased Array Based on Genetic Algorithm Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2507173","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7396973/07350131.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2507173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Wide-Angle Scanning and Low Sidelobe Level Microstrip Phased Array Based on Genetic Algorithm Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7350131/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755276","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331007, 61361166008 and 61401065"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20120185130001"},{"fundingName":"EHF Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science Project","grantNumber":"A03010023801171003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wide-Angle Scanning and Low Sidelobe Level Microstrip Phased Array Based on Genetic Algorithm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tap-wen-2507173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057445S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7396973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7396973","articleId":"7350131","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350133,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Seok Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7331739/7350133/choi-2507402-small.gif","p":["Jae-Seok Choi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2014.

To generate such HR images and a video of UHD resolutions in limited computing devices with hardware and software, low complex but excellent SR methods are particularly required. In this paper, we present a novel and fast SR method, called super-interpolation (SI), by unifying an interpolation step and a quality-enhancement step. The proposed SI method utilizes edge-orientation (EO)-based pre-learned kernels, which inherits the simplicity of interpolation and the quality enhancement of SR. It performs SR directly from the initial resolution of an input image to the target resolution of an up-scaled output image without requiring any intermediate interpolated image. The proposed SI method involves offline training and online up-scaling phases. In the offline training phase, training LR image patches are clustered based on their edge orientations into different EO classes for which class-dependent linear mapping functions are learned between training LR and HR image patches. In up-scaling phase, an HR output image patch for each LR input image patch is generated by applying an appropriate linear mapping function selected based on the EO of LR input image patch. Our proposed SI method is intensively compared with the ten state-of-the-art SR methods for common image sets and many HD/UHD images. The experimental results show that the SI method yields the smallest running time and requires relatively small hardware resources. It outperforms the six state-of-the-art methods in average (peak signal-to-noise ratio) PSNR/(structural similarity) SSIM, and exhibits competitive or somewhat lower PSNR/SSIM performance compared with the others.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15675994","pubMedId":"26672039","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7350133/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Super-Interpolation With Edge-Orientation-Based Mapping Kernels for Low Complex <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> Upscaling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"End Run Project 2015 within the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"N01150563"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Interpolation With Edge-Orientation-Based Mapping Kernels for Low Complex <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> Upscaling","sourcePdf":"tip-kim-2507402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1113S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7331739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7331739","articleId":"7350133","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":7350141,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/7581001/7350141/liu-2503422-small.gif","p":["Jianhua Liu (M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Jianxi Normal University, Nanchang, China, in 1990; the M.Sc. degree in computer science from Guanxi Normal University, Guiling, China, in 2000; and the Ph.D. degree in information science from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2009.","He was a Lecturer and an Associate Professor with Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China, from 2000 to 2010.

There have been intensive studies of the inertia weight in continuous optimization, but little attention has been paid to the binary case. This paper comprehensively investigates the effect of the inertia weight on the performance of binary PSO (BPSO), from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. A mathematical model is proposed to analyze the behavior of BPSO, based on which several lemmas and theorems on the effect of the inertia weight are derived. Our research findings suggest that in the binary case, a smaller inertia weight enhances the exploration capability while a larger inertia weight encourages exploitation. Consequently, this paper proposes a new adaptive inertia weight scheme for BPSO. This scheme allows the search process to start first with exploration and gradually move toward exploitation by linearly increasing the inertia weight. The experimental results on 0/1 knapsack problems show that the BPSO with the new increasing inertia weight scheme performs significantly better than that with the conventional decreasing and constant inertia weight schemes. This paper verifies the efficacy of increasing inertia weight in BPSO.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/7581001/07350141.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis of the Inertia Weight Parameter for Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2015.2503422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7581001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2015.2503422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of the Inertia Weight Parameter for Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16355187","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7350141/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503082"},{"fundingName":"Provincial Key Science and Technology Foundation of Fujian, China","grantNumber":"2012H0002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of the Inertia Weight Parameter for Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-mei-2503422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123439S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7581001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7581001","articleId":"7350141","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350142,"authors":[{"name":"Yujian Li","affiliation":["Institute of Lightwave Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7396973/7350142/yujli-2507170-small.gif","p":["Yujian Li (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) was born in Hunan, China, in 1987.

Good radiation characteristics, including almost identical unidirectional radiation patterns in two orthogonal planes, frontto-back ratio larger than 20 dB, cross-polarization levels less than -23 dB, and a stable gain around 8 dBi over the operating band, are achieved. By employing the proposed radiating element, a 2 \u00d7 2 wideband antenna array working at the 60GHz band is designed, fabricated, and tested, which can generate two-dimensional (2-D) multiple beams with dual polarization. A measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth wider than 22% and a gain up to 12.5 dBi are obtained. Owing to the superiority of the ME dipole, the radiation pattern of the array is also stable over the operating frequencies and nearly identical in two orthogonal planes for both of the polarizations.

The proposed dual bit associative memory with match error and mask control (EMDBAM) consumes low power and selects the valid value on matchline through match error controller.

By regarding the flexible dynamics as equivalent disturbances, the vehicle model can be split into three functional subsystems, namely, horizontal translation subsystem, vertical translation subsystem, and rotation subsystem. Then, for each subsystem, a disturbance observer is utilized to estimate the lumped effect of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator faults, while a novel auxiliary system combined with the command prefilter is constructed to handle the physical constraints on actuators. Furthermore, sliding mode control is employed to design control commands for the three subsystems, sequentially. The proposed controller modifies the reference trajectories dynamically when one or more actuators become constrained, and can steer the AHV to the desired trim finally. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350157/","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7350157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985717","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Back-Stepping Fault-Tolerant Control of the Flexible Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61525303 and 61503099"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570293"},{"fundingName":"Self-Planned Task of State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System (HIT)","grantNumber":"201505B"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Back-Stepping Fault-Tolerant Control of the Flexible Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tmech-liu-2507186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132899S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7463574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"7463574","articleId":"7350157","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7350164,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communication, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37708317000"},{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K."],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278653500"},{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Krikidis","id":"37275149300"},{"name":"Xuchu Dai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communication, Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuchu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37279595200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7350164","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":474},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the buffer-aided relay selection problem for a decode-and-forward cooperative wireless network with K relays. We propose a new relay selection scheme that incorporates the status of the relay buffers and the instantaneous strength of the wireless links. Specifically, each link is assigned with a weight related to the buffer status; then, the best relay is selected with the largest weight among all the qualified source-relay and relay-destination links. We derive the closed-form expression for the outage probability and the diversity gain by introducing several Markov chains (MCs) to model the evolution of the buffer status. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the optimal diversity gain 2K for a small L (i.e., L \u2265 3), an improvement in comparison with the existing max-link scheme that achieves the optimal diversity gain only when L is sufficiently large, where L denotes the buffer size of each relay. The provided theoretical and numerical results confirm the performance gain of the proposed relay selection scheme over the existing max-link scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07350164.pdf","startPage":"8788","endPage":"8794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2507360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2507360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Optimal Diversity Gain in Buffer-Aided Relay Networks With Small Buffer Size","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity methods","Cooperative systems","Analytical models","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Markov processes","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","Markov processes","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer-aided relay networks","optimal diversity gain","small buffer size","buffer-aided relay selection problem","decode-and-forward cooperative wireless network","relay buffers","instantaneous strength","wireless links","source-relay","relay-destination links","outage probability","Markov chains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buffer aided","cooperative networks","diversity gain","Markov chain (MC)","relay selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Optimal Diversity Gain in Buffer-Aided Relay Networks With Small Buffer Size","volume":"65","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7350164/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378650","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471334"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB329004"},{"fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570544"},{"fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1"},{"fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus","grantNumber":"FUPLEX CY-IL/0114/02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Optimal Diversity Gain in Buffer-Aided Relay Networks With Small Buffer Size","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2507360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112861S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7350164","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350211,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7350211/li-2499271-small.gif","p":["Yong Li (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in electronics and information engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2012.

Network function virtualization (NFV) is proposed to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure software on commodity and general hardware. NFV allows flexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the software-defined NFV architecture as the state of the art of NFV and present relationships between NFV and SDN. Then, we provide a historic view of the involvement from middlebox to NFV. Finally, we introduce significant challenges and relevant solutions of NFV, and discuss its future research directions by different application domains.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2499271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2499271","startPage":"2542","endPage":"2553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07350211.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-Defined Network Function Virtualization: A Survey","topic":"Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Software-Defined Network Function Virtualization: A Survey","volume":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15638885","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2015","htmlLink":"/document/7350211/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB329105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61300224, 61301080, 61171065, 61273214, 91338203 and 91338102"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Collaboration Program through the Ministry of Science and Technology, China, and National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2014DFT10070 and 61572220"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Software-Defined Network Function Virtualization: A Survey","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2499271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.195549S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks"],"articleId":"7350211","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7350216,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Sarafis","affiliation":["National Centre of Scientific Research Demokritos, Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7350216/saraf-2500339-small.gif","p":["Panagiotis Sarafis was born in 1985.

The goal of this study was to detect sensory events from tactile afferent signals continuously in real time using a novel unsorted spike-based pattern recognition method. The tactile afferent signals were recorded with a 16-channel microelectrode in the dorsal root ganglion, and unsorted spike-based feature vectors were extracted as a novel combination of the time and time-frequency domain features. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, and a multilayer perceptron classifier was used to detect sensory events. The proposed method showed good performance for classification accuracy, and the processing time delay of sensory event detection was less than 200 ms. These results indicated that the proposed method could be applicable for sensory feedback in closed-loop control systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Unsorted Spike-Based Pattern Recognition Method for Real-Time Continuous Sensory Event Detection from Dorsal Root Ganglion Recording","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2490739","endPage":"1320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7471384/07350222.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"1310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2490739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7471384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350222","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Electrodes","Neurons","Event detection","Muscles","Sensors","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","closed loop systems","medical control systems","medical disorders","medical signal processing","microelectrodes","multilayer perceptrons","neuromuscular stimulation","pattern recognition","principal component analysis","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsorted spike-based pattern recognition method","real-time continuous sensory event detection","dorsal root ganglion recording","functional neuromuscular stimulation systems","sensory information-based closed-loop control systems","hemiplegia patients","quadriplegia patients","tactile afferent signals","16-channel microelectrode","time-frequency domain features","principal component analysis","feature vectors","multilayer perceptron classifier","classification accuracy","sensory event detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensory event detection","pattern recognition","sensory feedback","unsorted spike"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Animals","Feedback, Sensory","Ganglia, Spinal","Male","Models, Neurological","Neural Pathways","Pattern Recognition, Physiological","Physical Stimulation","Principal Component Analysis","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley"]},{"kwd":["Pattern recognition","sensory event detection","sensory feedback","unsorted spike"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Unsorted Spike-Based Pattern Recognition Method for Real-Time Continuous Sensory Event Detection from Dorsal Root Ganglion Recording","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","volume":"63","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7350222/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2016","accessionNumber":"16002602","pubMedId":"26672029","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Pioneer Research Center Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"20100019348"},{"fundingName":"Korea Health Technology R&D Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003710","fundingName":"Korea Health Industry Development Institute"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008903","fundingName":"Ministry of Health & Welfare","grantNumber":"HI14C3477"},{"fundingName":"Korea Institute of Science and Technology Institutional Program","grantNumber":"2E25505"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Unsorted Spike-Based Pattern Recognition Method for Real-Time Continuous Sensory Event Detection from Dorsal Root Ganglion Recording","sourcePdf":"tbme-youn-2490739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075643S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7471384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7471384","articleId":"7350222","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7350223,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran M.

Unlike the commonly used approach to DPC where the coding scheme involves concatenation of a channel code and a quantization code, the proposed method embodies a unified approach that emulates the binning method used in the proof of the DPC result. Auxiliary bits are used to create the desired number of code vectors in each bin. Sum codes are obtained when information sequences augmented with auxiliary bits are encoded using linear block codes. Sum-code-based DPC schemes can be implemented using any linear block code, and entail a relatively small increase in decoder complexity when compared to standard communication schemes. They can also lead to significant reduction in transmit power in comparison to standard schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2499278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

As for the PM voltage balancing of this MMC, the switching frequency must be kept low to reduce the losses and the accurate calculation of the PM switching frequency is of great importance to the design of the cooling system. This letter presented a low-switching frequency PM balancing method by introducing the balancing adjusting number (BAN). The PM switching frequency calculation method is also presented with different BANs.

With the click data collected from the users' searching behavior, existing approaches take either one-to-one paired data (text-image pairs) or ranking examples (text-query-image and/or image-query-text ranking lists) as training examples, which do not make full use of the click data, particularly the implicit connections among the data objects. In this paper, we treat the click data as a large click graph, in which vertices are images/text queries and edges indicate the clicks between an image and a query. We consider learning a multimodal representation from the perspective of encoding the explicit/implicit relevance relationship between the vertices in the click graph. By minimizing both the truncated random walk loss as well as the distance between the learned representation of vertices and their corresponding deep neural network output, the proposed model which is named multimodal random walk neural network (MRW-NN) can be applied to not only learn robust representation of the existing multimodal data in the click graph, but also deal with the unseen queries and images to support cross-modal retrieval. We evaluate the latent representation learned by MRW-NN on a public large-scale click log data set Clickture and further show that MRW-NN achieves much better cross-modal retrieval performance on the unseen queries/images than the other state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15683738","pubMedId":"26672038","htmlLink":"/document/7350243/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning of Multimodal Representations With Random Walks on the Click Graph","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning of Multimodal Representations With Random Walks on the Click Graph","sourcePdf":"tip-wu-2507401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098246S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7362298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7362298","articleId":"7350243","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350250,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Alghassi","affiliation":["Transport and Manufacturing, Cranfield University, bedford, bedfordshire, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/24/7480880/7350250/7350250-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alirezza Alghassi received the B.Sc. degree in electrical power engineering in Iran, the B.Sc. degree in control system engineering from Sheffield University, U.K., and the M.Sc. degree in power electronic engineering from Nottingham University.

Hence, the reliability of these power electronic components is critical to reducing the maintenance cost of these assets. It is vital that the health of these components is monitored for increasing the safety and availability of a system. The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostic technique for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of power electronic components. There is a need for an efficient prognostic algorithm that is embeddable and able to support on-board real-time decision-making. A time delay neural network (TDNN) is used in the development of failure modes for an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Initially, the time delay neural network is constructed from training IGBTs' ageing samples. A stochastic process is performed for the estimation results to compute the probability of the health state during the degradation process. The proposed TDNN fusion with a statistical approach benefits the probability distribution function by improving the accuracy of the results of the TDDN in RUL prediction. The RUL (i.e., mean and confidence bounds) is then calculated from the simulation of the estimated degradation states. The prognostic results are evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) and relative accuracy (RA) prognostic evaluation metrics.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/7480880/07350250.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic RUL Calculation Enhanced With TDNN-Based IGBT Failure Modeling","doi":"10.1109/TR.2015.2499960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7480880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2015.2499960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic RUL Calculation Enhanced With TDNN-Based IGBT Failure Modeling","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16034873","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7350250/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic RUL Calculation Enhanced With TDNN-Based IGBT Failure Modeling","sourcePdf":"tr-alghassi-2499960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083685S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7480880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7480880","articleId":"7350250","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350251,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Systems Information Science, Future University Hakodate, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan","School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7502194/7350251/7350251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanyu Zhang received the B.S. degree in software engineering and M.S. degree in computer science from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

Understanding the security performance of wireless communications lays the foundation for the security management of IoT. Eavesdropper collusion represents a significant threat to wireless communication security, while physical-layer security serves as a promising approach to providing a strong form of security guarantee. This paper studies the important secrecy outage performance of wireless communications under eavesdropper collusion, where the physical layer security is adopted to counteract such attack. Based on the classical Probability Theory, we first conduct analysis on the secrecy outage of the simple noncolluding case in which eavesdroppers do not collude and operate independently. For the secrecy outage analysis of the more hazardous M-colluding scenario, where any M eavesdroppers can combine their observations to decode the message, the techniques of Laplace transform, keyhole contour integral, and Cauchy Integral Theorem are jointly adopted to work around the highly cumbersome multifold convolution problem involved in such analysis, such that the related signal-to-interference ratio modeling for all colluding eavesdroppers can be conducted and thus the corresponding secrecy outage probability can be analytically determined. Finally, simulation and numerical results are provided to illustrate our theoretical achievements. An interesting observation suggests that the SOP increases first superlinearly and then sublinearly with M.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Secure Wireless Communications for IoT Under Eavesdropper Collusion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2015.2497663","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7502194/07350251.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2015.2497663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7502194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"On Secure Wireless Communications for IoT Under Eavesdropper Collusion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7350251/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16122735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Secure Wireless Communications for IoT Under Eavesdropper Collusion","sourcePdf":"tase-yong-2497663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137188S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7502194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7502194","articleId":"7350251","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7350260,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy Palomo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Wireless and Microwave Information Systems (WAMI), Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7370835/7350260/7350260-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timothy Palomo (S\u201912) was born in Maracay, Venezuela, on October 5, 1990.

This paper utilizes a hybrid (circuit and electromagnetic simulation) model for time efficient simulations and introduces fourth-order bandpass filter designs for the first time to extend the applicability of the technique to higher order frequency-agile RF filter design. The paper introduces novel microfluidic channel and resonator configurations to demonstrate that the proposed filters can serve application specific footprint needs. By resorting to a selectively metallized plate approach, the reliability issue associated with synchronized movement of multiple metallized plates has been resolved. The filters are incorporated with micropumps to enable their automated control. Specifically, the concepts are demonstrated through design, fabrication, and testing of two fourth-order bandpass filters exhibiting different resonator arrangement layouts. The filters were measured to operate over ~ 2:1 (60%) frequency tuning range (0.8 GHz -1.5 GHz) with better than 4.5 dB IL, ~ 5% constant fractional bandwidth (FBW), and >40 dB out of band rejection implying a good agreement with the simulation based performance predictions. For the selected micropumps and investigated microfluidic channel layouts, the best tuning speed was measured to be 2.12 MHz per millisecond.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7370835/07350260.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7370835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microfluidically Reconfigurable Metallized Plate Loaded Frequency-Agile RF Bandpass Filters","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/22/7370835/7350260-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Microfluidically Reconfigurable Metallized Plate Loaded Frequency-Agile RF Bandpass Filters","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685005","htmlLink":"/document/7350260/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Microfluidically Reconfigurable Metallized Plate Loaded Frequency-Agile RF Bandpass Filters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-palomo-2504473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070374S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7370835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7370835","articleId":"7350260","onlineDate":"09 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7350261,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Qiu","affiliation":["Center for Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN), The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia","Hunan provincial Engineering Research Center of Electric transportation and smart distributed network, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7546948/7350261/7350261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Qiu (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) obtained his B.Eng. degree in control engineering from Shandong University, China, M.Sc. degree in environmental policy and management, majoring in carbon financing in the power sector, from The University of Manchester, U.K., and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from The University of Newcastle, Australia.","He is now a Research Associate at the Center for Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN), The University of Newcastle, Australia.

The reliable and affordable gas supply hence becomes an important factor to consider in power system planning. Meanwhile, the installation of GPG units should take into account not only the fuel supply constraints but also the capability of sending out the generated power. In this paper, a novel expansion co-planning (ECP) model is proposed, aiming to minimize the overall capital and operational costs for the coupled gas and power systems. Moreover, linear formulations are introduced to deal with the nonlinear nature of the objective functions and constraints. Furthermore, the physical and economic interactions between the two systems are simulated by an iterative process. The proposed linear co-planning approach is tested on a simple six-bus power system with a seven-node gas system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system with a 14-node gas system. Numerical results have demonstrated that our co-planning approach can allow systematic investigations on supporting cost-effective operating and planning decisions for power systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7546948/07350261.pdf","startPage":"3594","endPage":"3606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

These filters have a wide range of applications because of their characteristics. They are easy to be designed, they have guaranteed bounded input-bounded output (BIBO) stability and can be designed to present linear phase at all frequencies. Traditional optimization methods based on gradient are susceptible to getting trapped on a local optima solution when they are applied to optimize multimodal problems, such as the FIR filter design. Here, to overcome this drawback, the aforementioned metaheuristics are adopted to obtain the coefficients of low pass FIR filters of order 20 and 24. The performance of BA and PSO algorithms are compared with the classical Parks and McClellan (PM) filter design algorithm, which is a deterministic procedure. For this comparison is considered the filters pass band and stop band ripples, transition width and statistical data. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed filter design approach using BA algorithm outperforms PM and PSO.","startPage":"207","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347170/7347907/07350468.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7347907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of digital low pass Finite Impulse Response filter using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bat Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Frequency response","Simulation","Chebyshev approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FIR Filter Design","Bat Algorithm","Particle Swarm","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of digital low pass Finite Impulse Response filter using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bat Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/7350468/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of digital low pass Finite Impulse Response filter using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bat Algorithm","confLoc":"Colmar, France","sourcePdf":"ICINCO2015144CR.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095881S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347170","isNumber":"7347907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347170","xplore-issue":"7347907","articleId":"7350468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SCITEPRESS","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7350618,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Igarashi","affiliation":["Research & Development Group, Center for Technology Innovation-Systems Engineering"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Igarashi","id":"37085609210"},{"name":"Matti Hiltunen","affiliation":["AT &T Labs - Research"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Hiltunen","id":"37273276300"},{"name":"Kaustubh Joshi","affiliation":["AT &T Labs - Research"],"firstName":"Kaustubh","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37267824700"},{"name":"Richard Schlichting","affiliation":["AT &T Labs - Research"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Schlichting","id":"37273276500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9942-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-9941-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home automation","Cloud computing","Sensors","Actuators","Cameras","Quality of service","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","home automation","security","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource-constrained devices","CEHC architecture","cloud-enhanced home controller","local home controller","automation systems","home security","cloud offloading","extensible home automation architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud","Offload","Home automation","Application ecosystem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350618","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2015.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2015.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350553","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7349016/7350553/07350618.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Extensible Home Automation Architecture Based on Cloud Offloading","abstract":"Current home security and automation systems are typically structured as a collection of sensors and actuators connected to a local home controller. While new and more capable sensors are driving increasingly sophisticated applications such as video surveillance that require significant computing resources, home controllers are often resource-constrained devices that are not easy to upgrade or replace at scale. To address these limitations, we present a new Cloud-Enhanced Home Controller (CEHC) architecture where the resources of the local home controller are augmented with external cloud resources accessed over the network. While such cloud offloading has been studied in the context of other resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, we posit that home control applications pose a new set of requirements unique to this domain. Here, we describe these requirements, propose an application ecosystem that enables the seamless use of both local and remote resources, and describe a decision engine that schedules applications under constraints imposed by the home controller, the network, and the costs associated with the cloud service provider.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7350618/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15662342","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Extensible Home Automation Architecture Based on Cloud Offloading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extensible Home Automation Architecture Based on Cloud Offloading","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"9942a187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047889S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7349016","isNumber":"7350553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7349016","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7350553","articleId":"7350618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7350621,"authors":[{"name":"Yosuke Kikuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Kikuchi","id":"37085563878"},{"name":"Yoshitaka Shibata","affiliation":["Faculty of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University, Iwate, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Yoshitaka","lastName":"Shibata","id":"37269452500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9942-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-9941-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350621","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Monitoring","Information systems","Mobile communication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","delay tolerant networks","disasters","emergency management","geology","information systems","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","delay tolerant network protocol","geological condition","Japan Island","resilient oriented network infrastructure","disaster information system","disaster server resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disaster Information System","Cloud Computing","System Virtualization","Delay Tolerant Networking"]}],"abstract":"From the geological condition of Japan Island, many serious disasters such as earthquake, tsunami and typhoon occurred in history.

The larger number of appliances of different power rating for each type of load is considered in this work. The focus of this work is to minimize the Peak to Average Ratio (PAR) to increase the efficiency of SG, by increasing the utilization of spinning reserves. On the other hand, our aim is to minimize the electricity consumption cost. Tackling the large number of appliances in an SG is a challenging task, because it increases the complexity of the problem. However, in literature the focus is on small number of appliance. In this work, the load scheduling problem is mathematically formulated and solved by using genetic algorithm. The simulation results show that the propose algorithm reduces the cost, while reducing the peak load demand of the

become a useful tool for malicious users. With Tor, the users are able to compromise the non-repudiation principle of computer security. Also, the potentially hackers may launch attacks such as DDoS or identity theft behind Tor. For this reason, there are needed new systems and models to detect the intrusion in Tor networks. In this paper, we present the application of Neural Networks (NNs) for intrusion detection in Tor networks. We used the Back-propagation NN and constructed a Tor server and a Deep Web browser (client). Then, the client sends the data browsing to the Tor server using the Tor network. We used Wireshark Network Analyzer to get the data and then used the Backpropagation NN to make the approximation. We present many simulation results for different number of hidden units. The simulation results show that our simulation system has a good approximation and can be used for intrusion detection in Tor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350690/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15662271","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350690/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection System for Tor Networks Considering different Hidden Units","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of a Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection System for Tor Networks Considering different Hidden Units","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"9942a620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066545S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7349016","isNumber":"7350553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7349016","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7350553","articleId":"7350690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350759,"authors":[{"name":"Michel B\u00e4tz","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Ntirnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"B\u00e4tz","id":"37424271400"},{"name":"Andrea Eichenseer","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Ntirnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Eichenseer","id":"37076798900"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Seiler","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Ntirnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Seiler","id":"37569803900"},{"name":"Markus Jonscher","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Jonscher","id":"37085359549"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Kaup","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Ntirnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Kaup","id":"37285096200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350759","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":551},"abstract":"Achieving a higher spatial resolution is of particular interest in many applications such as video surveillance and can be realized by employing higher resolution sensors or applying super-resolution methods.

The mask is computed from the motion information utilized in the multi-image super-resolution part. This concept is shown to work for one particular setup but is also extensible toward other combinations of single-image and multi-image super-resolution algorithms as well as other merging metrics. Simulation results show an average luminance PSNR gain of up to 0.85 dB and 0.59 dB for upscaling factors of 2 and 4, respectively.

As opposed to synthesis dictionary learning, transform learning allows for cheap computations, and has been demonstrated to perform well in applications such as image denoising. Very recently, we proposed methods for online sparsifying transform learning, which are particularly useful for processing large-scale or streaming data. Online transform learning has good convergence guarantees and enjoys a much lower computational cost than online synthesis dictionary learning. In this work, we present a video denoising framework based on online 3D spatio-temporal sparsifying transform learning. The proposed scheme has low computational and memory costs, and can potentially handle streaming video. Our numerical experiments show promising performance for the proposed video denoising method compared to popular prior or state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350771","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350771.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video denoising by online 3D sparsifying transform learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350771/","displayDocTitle":"Video denoising by online 3D sparsifying transform learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653764","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350771/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video denoising by online 3D sparsifying transform learning","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3882tCV301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068933S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350781,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085339290"},{"name":"Roozbeh Jafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Jafari","id":"37279246000"},{"name":"Nasser Kehtarnavaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Kehtarnavaz","id":"37085445299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350781","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":243,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3085},"abstract":"Human action recognition has a wide range of applications including biometrics, surveillance, and human computer interaction.

These modalities include RGB videos, depth videos, skeleton positions, and inertial signals from a Kinect camera and a wearable inertial sensor for a comprehensive set of 27 human actions. Experimental results are provided to show how this database can be used to study fusion approaches that involve using both depth camera data and inertial sensor data.

Subsequent clustering of the posterior class distributions computed at training allows for sharp reduction of large binary tests sets memory footprint, while preserving their high accuracy. Our validation considers a smart metering applicative scenario, and demonstrates that up to 80% of the memory usage can be saved, at constant accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350793","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350793.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350793","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","startPage":"227","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating memory requirements for random trees/ferns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating memory requirements for random trees/ferns","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350793/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350793/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654201","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating memory requirements for random trees/ferns","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3883yh9151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06356S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350800,"authors":[{"name":"Yunye Gong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yunye","lastName":"Gong","id":"37085690430"},{"name":"Peter C.

To bridge the gap between academic research accomplishment and industrial needs, high efficiency BIQA approaches that allow for real-time computation are highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a novel BIQA method by selecting statistical features extracted from binary patterns of local image structures. This allows us to largely reduce the feature space to eventually one dimension. Somewhat surprisingly, such a single feature, faster-than-real-time approach named local pattern statistics index (LPSI) exhibits impressive generalization ability across different distortion types and achieves competitive quality prediction performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches on public databases such as LIVE II and TID2008.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350816","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","startPage":"339","endPage":"343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350816.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Image quality","Training","Feature extraction","Nonlinear distortion","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TID2008","LIVE II","quality prediction performance","generalization ability","LPSI","local pattern statistics index","statistical feature extraction","BIQA approach","blind image quality assessment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image quality assessment","blind image quality assessment","local binary pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A highly efficient method for blind image quality assessment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350816/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350816/","accessionNumber":"15654108","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly efficient method for blind image quality assessment","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3885fbJ81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074444S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7350827,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjung Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngjung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085429625"},{"name":"Sunghwan Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37598991000"},{"name":"Changjae Oh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Changjae","lastName":"Oh","id":"38468058800"},{"name":"Kwanghoon Sohn","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kwanghoon","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37287181100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350827","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Color","Sensors","Optimization","Image color analysis","Robustness","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","image resolution","image sampling","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["majorize-minimize approach","high-quality depth upsampling","nonconvex model","depth measurement","video rate","low resolution","optimization","robust potential function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth map upsampling","depth sensor","time of flight camera","optimization","majorization-minimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350827","abstract":"This paper describes a non-convex model that is carefully designed for high quality depth upsampling. Modern depth sensors such as time-of-flight cameras provide a promising depth measurement with video rate, but suffer from noise and low resolution. To tackle these limitations, we formulate an optimization problem using a robust potential function. In this formulation, a nonlocal principle established in the high-dimensional feature space is used to disambiguate the up-sampling problem. We also derive a numerical algorithm based on the majorization-minimization approach for efficient optimization. The proposed model iteratively creates a new affinity space that determines the influence of neighboring pixels by jointly considering spatial distance, appearance, and current estimates. This behavior enables one to significantly reduce annoying artifacts on a variety of range dataset, including a challenging real measurement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350827","startPage":"392","endPage":"396","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350827.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A majorize-minimize approach for high-quality depth upsampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A majorize-minimize approach for high-quality depth upsampling","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350827/","accessionNumber":"15654573","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350827/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A majorize-minimize approach for high-quality depth upsampling","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3885ysu151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044555S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7350836,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Yuan","affiliation":["Real Communications Inc.

Both the predictor and the noisy pixel are input into the linear denoiser to finally remove the noise. This framework only refers the information of the neighborhood of a noisy pixel and explores the best spatial and temporal denoising ratio adaptive to its local characteristics. Experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms the traditional block based denoising method by 1\u20133 dB of PSNR in denoising quality and also achieves a 1\u20133 dB gain when using it in HEVC encoder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Noise measurement","Hardware","Correlation","Encoding","Prediction algorithms","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image filtering","image motion analysis","image texture","mean square error methods","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion-texture aware denoising","economic hardware design","parallel hardware design","linear denoising filter","minimum mean square error","MMSE","HEVC encoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video denoising","spatial-temporal analysis","hardware design","HEVC encoder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350836","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350836.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion-texture aware denoising for economic hardware design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A motion-texture aware denoising for economic hardware design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350836/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350836/","accessionNumber":"15653958","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion-texture aware denoising for economic hardware design","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3886J58151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070939S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7350839,"authors":[{"name":"Sue Han Lee","affiliation":["Fac.

As prior information, a dictionary (light field atoms), which was learned from training datasets, was used in the current state of the art. Meanwhile, it was reported that general bases such as DCT were not suitable to efficiently represent prior information.

In this paper, we novelly address the blurred image recognition task from the perspective of domain adaptation (DA). The scenario is that, the training set (source domain) only comprises of the labelled clear images, and the test set (target domain) is composed of the unlabelled blurred images. DA is executed to eliminate the domain shift by subspace alignment. In this way, the clear and blurred image domains are pushed closer in the feature space. The supervised LMDR metric learning method is employed by us to construct the source domain subspace for further performance enhancement, compared to the unsupervised one (i.e., PCA). The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that, the proposed DA-based blurred image recognition mechanism can significantly enhance the performance of different kinds of visual descriptors, especially when the blurring degree is strong.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350855.pdf","startPage":"532","endPage":"536","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blurred image recognition using domain adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Measurement","Training","Visualization","Principal component analysis","Face","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blurred image recognition","domain adaptation","DA","training set","source domain","labelled clear image","test set","target domain","unlabelled blurred images","subspace alignment","feature space","supervised LMDR metric learning method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blurred image recognition","domain adaptation","subspace alignment","LMDR metric learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Blurred image recognition using domain adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350855/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653771","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blurred image recognition using domain adaptation","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3887JY2151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089206S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350865,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Ni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

Besides, the homogeneity of land covers' distribution, that neighboring pixels usually belong to the same class, is also an important spatial information in HSI analysis. In this paper, a novel classification method in a sample set perspective is proposed to jointly exploit the spectral and the spatial information. More specifically, the proposed method treats the neighboring pixels as a sample set from the same class, and then classifies the set in the affine subspace spanned by the samples of the set using sparse representation based classification. In order to reduce the impact of possible outliers in the set, a weighted affine constraint is enforced on the combination coefficients. With this remedy, the proposed method is not only effective in exploiting the complementary information among the neighboring pixels of the same class, but also robust to possible outliers caused by neighbors of other classes. Experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches for HSI classification with limited training samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7350865/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653879","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sample set perspective on the classification of hyperspectral image with weighted affine constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sample set perspective on the classification of hyperspectral image with weighted affine constraint","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"38887Dj3012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059432S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350869,"authors":[{"name":"Ramakalavathi Marapareddy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS, USA","Ueosvstems Research Institute, Mississitmi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Ramakalavathi","lastName":"Marapareddy","id":"37085703200"},{"name":"James V.

Cameras mounted on a moving vehicle such as a hi-rail vehicle or a geometry inspection car can generate large volumes of high resolution images. Extracting accurate information from those images has been challenging due to background clutter in railroad environments. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to visual track inspection using material classification and semantic segmentation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). We show that DCNNs trained end-to-end for material classification are more accurate than shallow learning machines with hand-engineered features and are more robust to noise. Our approach results in a material classification accuracy of 93.35% using 10 classes of materials.

The most frequent precancerous cancer lesions are polyps characterized by abnormal tissue growth in the human bowel. There are also anomalies such as inflammation and bleeding area. Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a recent promising technology which enables to obtain videos of the inside of the intestine via an on board digital camera. The small capsule ingested by the patient is recuperated after it passes through the whole gastrointestinal track. Expert gastroenterologists analyze the video sequence visually in order to find out frames containing abnormalities related to cancer. This process is labor intensive and time consuming. In this paper we propose an algorithm that provides automatic video analysis in order to classify tissue regions in images into two categories: normal and abnormal. In order to achieve high correct classification rates, we first pre-process the image data by removing the noise in it and by normalizing the intensity values of the image pixels. Next, we use the well-known SIFT descriptor algorithm with Bag of Feature (BoF) approach for feature extraction. For training, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on the extracted features using the training dataset. Finally a testing data set is used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The early experimental results are very encouraging and show high correct classification rates, reaching up to 98.25% for images with polyps. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the combination of using specific SIFT features with Bof and the vignetting correction to capture the local characteristics of the abnormalities in capsule video endoscopy images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350962","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350962.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic detection of colonoscopic anomalies using capsule endoscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350962/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic detection of colonoscopic anomalies using capsule endoscopy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653753","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350962/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic detection of colonoscopic anomalies using capsule endoscopy","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388AZLw151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071514S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350972,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Che","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Che","id":"37085553273"},{"name":"Xinwei Gao","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xinwei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37065165200"},{"name":"Xiaopeng Fan","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37401467700"},{"name":"Feng Jiang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37414830600"},{"name":"Debin Zhao","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277017000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350972","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video sequences","Compressed sensing","Correlation","Image reconstruction","Sparse matrices","Approximation methods","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data compression","gradient methods","image reconstruction","image representation","matrix algebra","spatiotemporal phenomena","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residual domain based video CS reconstruction approaches","still-image CS recovery algorithms","gradient descent","low-rank matrix approximation problem","video CS recovery","low dimensional subspace description","spatial-temporal sparse representation based recovery","temporal correlations","spatial correlations","error propagation","hierarchical frame based video CS framework","hierarchical frame based video compressed sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video compressed sensing","hierarchical structure framework","spatial-temporal sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the hierarchical frame based video compressed sensing (CS) framework is proposed, which outperforms the traditional framework through the better exploitation of frames correlation with reference frames, the unequal sample subrates setting among frames in different layers and the reduction of the error propagation. By considering the spatial and temporal correlations of the video sequence, a spatial-temporal sparse representation based recovery is proposed for this framework. The similar blocks in both the current frame and these recovered reference frames are composed as a spatial-temporal group, which is defined as the unit of the sparse representation. By exploiting the low dimensional subspace description of each group, the video CS recovery is converted as a low-rank matrix approximation problem, which can be solved by exploiting the hard thresholding and the gradient descent. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance against both the state-of-art still-image CS recovery algorithms and the existing residual domain based video CS reconstruction approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350972","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350972.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-temporal recovery for hierarchical frame based video compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7350972/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-temporal recovery for hierarchical frame based video compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653795","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7350972/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-temporal recovery for hierarchical frame based video compressed sensing","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388bCa7151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078366S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7350972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7350981,"authors":[{"name":"Changil Kim","affiliation":["Disney Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Changil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085490277"},{"name":"Kartic Subr","affiliation":["Disney Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Kartic","lastName":"Subr","id":"37705970500"},{"name":"Kenny Mitchell","affiliation":["Disney Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Kenny","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"38235714800"},{"name":"Alexander Sorkine-Hornung","affiliation":["Disney Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sorkine-Hornung","id":"37075470300"},{"name":"Markus Gross","affiliation":["ETH, Zurich","Disney Research, Zurich"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Gross","id":"37275694700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7350981","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image resolution","Cameras","Algorithm design and analysis","Rendering (computer graphics)","Reconstruction algorithms","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","image reconstruction","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online view sampling","depth estimation","geometric information","image sampling","analysis model","light field depth reconstruction","visibility","depth resolvability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7350981","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07350981.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online view sampling for estimating depth from light fields","abstract":"Geometric information such as depth obtained from light fields finds more applications recently.

Moreover, the classification of InSAR images with a feature vector composed of GGD parameters shows a performance comparable to that of a non-parametric feature vector.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351023","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351023.pdf","startPage":"1364","endPage":"1368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of interferometric SAR images based on parametric modeling in the fractional fourier transform domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351023/","displayDocTitle":"Classification of interferometric SAR images based on parametric modeling in the fractional fourier transform domain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654510","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351023/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of interferometric SAR images based on parametric modeling in the fractional fourier transform domain","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388cQ99141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056375S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351026,"authors":[{"name":"Suren Vagharshakyan","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Suren","lastName":"Vagharshakyan","id":"37085665307"},{"name":"Robert Bregovic","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Bregovic","id":"37565697700"},{"name":"Atanas Gotchev","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Atanas","lastName":"Gotchev","id":"37267439600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351026","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Cameras","Rendering (computer graphics)","Frequency-domain analysis","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image representation","image restoration","image segmentation","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image based rendering technique","sparse representation","densely sampled light field reconstruction","rectified cameras","perspective views","intermediate views","epipolar-plane image inpainting","shearlet-domain representation","directional filters","directional selectivity","shearlet-domain sparsity condition","iterative thresholding algorithm","synthetic visual data","real visual data","depth-image based rendering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Light field","sparse reconstruction","shearlet","image based rendering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351026","abstract":"In this paper we propose a method for reconstructing a densely sampled light field from a given sparse set of perspective views from rectified cameras without an explicit estimation of the scene depth. The desired intermediate views are synthesized by inpainting of epipolar-plane images, utilizing their sparsity in the shearlet domain. For the purpose of shearlet-domain representation, compactly supported shearlets have been constructed using different directional filters for different scales in an attempt to provide better directional selectivity at lower scales. The reconstruction procedure with shearlet-domain sparsity condition is implemented through an iterative thresholding algorithm. The performance of the method is quantified by tests on synthetic and real visual data and compared favorably against depth-image based rendering.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351026","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1383","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351026.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image based rendering technique via sparse representation in shearlet domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Image based rendering technique via sparse representation in shearlet domain","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351026/","accessionNumber":"15653756","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351026/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image based rendering technique via sparse representation in shearlet domain","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388cTT4301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058175S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351053,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Real-time PAT imaging is limited by the number of parallel data acquisition channels and pulse repetition rate of the laser. Typical photoacoustic signals afford sparse representation.

In this work, we formulate photoacoustic signal recovery in the Distributed Compressed Sensing (DCS) framework to exploit this correlation.

Guided inpainting techniques can be very useful in settings where one has access to the ground truth information like most multiview coding applications. We propose a new auxiliary information based on patch clustering, which is used to refine the candidate exemplar set in the inpainting. For that purpose, a new recursive clustering method based on locally linear embedding (LLE) is introduced. We then design the guided inpainting solution based on LLE with clustered patches, which contrains the reconstruction to operate in one patch cluster only. The index of the appropriate cluster considered as auxiliary information. Experimental results show that our clustering algorithm provides clusters that are well suited to the inpainting problem. They also show that the auxiliary information enables to significantly improve the quality of the inpainted image for a small coding cost. This work is the first study to show that effective inpainting can be performed when the auxiliary information is properly adapted to the characteristics of both the hole and the known texture.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1706","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351091.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guided inpainting with cluster-based auxiliary information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Image reconstruction","Yttrium","Matching pursuit algorithms","Artificial intelligence","Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image restoration","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guided inpainting algorithm","cluster-based auxiliary information","exemplar-based approach","image synthesis applications","multiview coding applications","patch clustering","recursive clustering method","locally linear embedding","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Guided inpainting","auxiliary information","clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Guided inpainting with cluster-based auxiliary information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351091/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351091/","accessionNumber":"15653985","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided inpainting with cluster-based auxiliary information","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388eCoa151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048198S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351093,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Sorensen","affiliation":["Video/Image Modeling and Synthesis (VIMS) Lab Computer and Information Sciences University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Sorensen","id":"37073918500"},{"name":"Abhishek Kolagunda","affiliation":["Video/Image Modeling and Synthesis (VIMS) Lab Computer and Information Sciences University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Kolagunda","id":"37085646324"},{"name":"Philip Saponaro","affiliation":["Video/Image Modeling and Synthesis (VIMS) Lab Computer and Information Sciences University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Saponaro","id":"37392770400"},{"name":"Chandra Kambhamettu","affiliation":["Video/Image Modeling and Synthesis (VIMS) Lab Computer and Information Sciences University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Chandra","lastName":"Kambhamettu","id":"37085367435"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351093","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Ray tracing","Cameras","Mathematical model","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","ray tracing","refraction","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D points","light refraction modeling","3D reconstruction techniques","refractive surface pose problems","underwater objects","underwater structures reconstruction","refractive stereo ray tracing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater","Stereo Vision","Refraction"]}],"abstract":"Underwater objects behind a refractive surface pose problems for traditional 3D reconstruction techniques. Scenes where underwater objects are visible from the surface are commonplace, however the refraction of light causes 3D points in these scenes to project non-linearly. Refractive Stereo Ray Tracing allows for accurate reconstruction by modeling the refraction of light. Our approach uses techniques from ray tracing to compute the 3D position of points behind a refractive surface.

Experimental results show that up to 5.6% bit rate reduction can be achieved by the proposed loop filter when compared with HEVC reference software HM13.0.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351132.pdf","startPage":"1905","endPage":"1909","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance loop filter for HEVC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Transforms","Estimation","Yttrium","Optimization","Encoding","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image restoration","inverse problems","maximum likelihood estimation","optimisation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loop filtering problem","HEVC","frame restoration","inverse problem","maximum a posteriori estimation","optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC","MAP","Loop Filter","ICT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"High performance loop filter for HEVC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351132/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654519","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance loop filter for HEVC","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388fFU3141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043958S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351147,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas A.

The depth of these supervised networks has enabled learning deeper and hierarchical representation of features. In parallel, unsupervised deep learning such as Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN) has also achieved state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. However, there is very limited research on jointly exploiting the strength of these two approaches. In this paper, we investigate the learning capability of both methods. We compare the output of individual layers and show that many learnt filters and outputs of the corresponding level layer are almost similar for both approaches. Stacking the DCNN on top of unsupervised layers or replacing layers in the DCNN with the corresponding learnt layers in the CDBN can improve the recognition/classification accuracy and training computational expense. We demonstrate the validity of the proposal on ImageNet dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351206","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351206.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving deep convolutional neural networks with unsupervised feature learning","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654452","htmlLink":"/document/7351206/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving deep convolutional neural networks with unsupervised feature learning","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388HueR111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075781S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351216,"authors":[{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["School of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","id":"37986098300"},{"name":"Paul Fieguth","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Fieguth","id":"37265544300"},{"name":"Matti Pietik\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Pietik\u00e4inen","id":"37270106100"},{"name":"Songyang Lao","affiliation":["School of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Songyang","lastName":"Lao","id":"37396789600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351216","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Histograms","Nickel","Smoothing methods","Sensitivity","Image matching","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","image classification","image sampling","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["median robust extended local binary pattern","texture classification","high-performance texture feature","MRELBP","multiscale LBP-type descriptor","sampling scheme","Outex test suites","image noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Texture classification","Feature extraction","Local binary pattern","Local descriptors","Median filtering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351216","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351216.pdf","startPage":"2319","endPage":"2323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Median robust extended local binary pattern for texture classification","abstract":"Local Binary Patterns (LBP) are among the most computationally efficient amongst high-performance texture features. However, LBP is very sensitive to image noise and is unable to capture macrostructure information. To best address these disadvantages, in this paper we introduce a novel descriptor for texture classification, the Median Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern (MRELBP). In contrast to traditional LBP and many LBP variants, MRELBP compares local image medians instead of raw image intensities. We develop a multiscale LBP-type descriptor by efficiently comparing image medians over a novel sampling scheme, which can capture both microstructure and macrostructure. A comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets reveals MRELBP's remarkable performance (robust to gray scale variations, rotation changes and noise) relative to state-of-the-art algorithms, but nevertheless at a low computational cost, producing the best classification scores of 99.82%, 99.38% and 99.77% on three popular Outex test suites. Furthermore, MRELBP is also shown to be highly robust to image noise including Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, Salt-and-Pepper noise and random pixel corruption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7351216/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653841","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Median robust extended local binary pattern for texture classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Median robust extended local binary pattern for texture classification","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388io95101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085398S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351217,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Zuo","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Zuo","id":"38006120600"},{"name":"Ping An","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"An","id":"37284544000"},{"name":"Shuai Zheng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085620759"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279640000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351217","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351217","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Color","Image color analysis","Image resolution","Robustness","Markov random fields","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image colour analysis","image resolution","image sampling","image texture","Markov processes","optimisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture-copy artifacts","high-resolution color image","labeling optimization","edge-based depth map super-resolution method","video processing applications","3D image processing applications","depth information","time-of-flight sensors","edge-misaligned artifacts","Markov random fields","depth upsampling method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["depth map upsampling","Markov Random Field (MRF)","depth recovery"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the widely use of time-of-flight sensors captures depth information for dynamic scenes in real time, which promotes the developing of many 3D image or video processing applications.

In this work, a new BIQA model is proposed to utilize local normalized multi-scale difference of Gaussian (DoG) response in distorted images as features which show a high correlation with perceptual quality. Then, a three-step-framework based deep neural network (DNN) is designed and employed as the pooling strategy. Compared with the support vector machine (SVM), the proposed three-step-framework DNN can excavate better feature representation, leading to more accurate predictions and stronger generalization ability. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two authoritative databases and excellent generalization ability in cross database experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351221","startPage":"2344","endPage":"2348","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351221.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Difference of Gaussian statistical features based blind image quality assessment: A deep learning approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Feature extraction","Image quality","Distortion","Databases","Neural networks","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross database","authoritative databases","generalization ability","feature representation","DNN","three-step-framework based deep neural network","perceptual quality","high-correlation features","distorted images","DoG response","local normalized multiscale difference-of-Gaussian response","pooling strategy decision","feature mining","machine learning","BIQA models","NSS-based blind image quality assessment models","natural scene statistics","deep learning approach","difference-of-Gaussian statistical features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind image quality assessment","deep neural network","stacked auto-encoder","DoG"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Difference of Gaussian statistical features based blind image quality assessment: A deep learning approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654422","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Difference of Gaussian statistical features based blind image quality assessment: A deep learning approach","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388ixbD151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075955S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7351223,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Mousavi","affiliation":["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Liguria, IT"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Mousavi","id":"38185511900"},{"name":"Moin Nabi","affiliation":["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Liguria, IT"],"firstName":"Moin","lastName":"Nabi","id":"37085633409"},{"name":"Hamed Kiani","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Kiani","id":"37646279700"},{"name":"Alessandro Perina","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Perina","id":"37397765700"},{"name":"Vittorio Murino","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Murino","id":"37085369469"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351223","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking","Binary codes","Histograms","Training","Manganese","Heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","motion estimation","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision task","abnormal detection","tracklet-based commotion measure","crowd motion monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video analysis","abnormal detection","motion commotion","tracklets"]}],"abstract":"Abnormal detection in crowd is a challenging vision task due to the scarcity of real-world training examples and the lack of a clear definition of abnormality.

Inspired by the great success of GoogleLeNet with a deeper network and VGG networks with smaller receptive fields in the ImageNet competition, in this paper, we adopt a much deeper network with up to 15 layers and smaller receptive fields (3\u00d73) to learn better features for scene text recognition. Particularly, even without additional training data, our model can achieve better performance.

Experiments show that the proposed approach compares well to other recent online tracking systems on various datasets.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","startPage":"2414","endPage":"2418","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online multi-person tracking based on global sparse collaborative representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7351235/","displayDocTitle":"Online multi-person tracking based on global sparse collaborative representations","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654285","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online multi-person tracking based on global sparse collaborative representations","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388Jf7B151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078155S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7351239,"authors":[{"name":"Hanhe Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Hanhe","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085728491"},{"name":"Jeremiah D.

Recently, graph-based approaches have been proposed to address this issue, but the cost of transmitting graph topology often overcome the gain of such techniques. In this work we propose a new Superpixel-driven Graph Transform (SDGT) that uses clusters of superpixels, which have the ability to adhere nicely to edges in the image, as coding blocks and computes inside these homogeneously colored regions a graph transform which is shape-adaptive. Doing so, only the borders of the regions and the transform coefficients need to be transmitted, in place of all the structure of the graph. The proposed method is finally compared to DCT and the experimental results show how it is able to outperform DCT both visually and in term of PSNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351279.pdf","startPage":"2631","endPage":"2635","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superpixel-driven graph transform for image compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Image edge detection","Symmetric matrices","Image segmentation","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","graph theory","image coding","image colour analysis","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape-adaptive graph transform","homogeneously colored regions","coding blocks","superpixel clusters","arbitrary shaped discontinuities","block-based compression","image compression","superpixel-driven graph transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image compression","graph transform","superpixels","clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Superpixel-driven graph transform for image compression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351279/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653996","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superpixel-driven graph transform for image compression","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388kBTx151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066682S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351280,"authors":[{"name":"Zinelabidine Boulkenafet","affiliation":["Center for Machine Vision Research, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Zinelabidine","lastName":"Boulkenafet","id":"37074648300"},{"name":"Jukka Komulainen","affiliation":["Center for Machine Vision Research, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jukka","lastName":"Komulainen","id":"37076012500"},{"name":"Abdenour Hadid","affiliation":["Center for Machine Vision Research, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Abdenour","lastName":"Hadid","id":"37270104300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351280","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":144,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Image color analysis","Databases","Gray-scale","Histograms","Feature extraction","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color texture analysis","face spoofing detection","face image luminance analysis","chrominance information","face anti-spoofing method","color local binary pattern descriptor","feature histogram","image band","CASIA face anti-spoofing","replay-attack database"]}],"abstract":"Research on face spoofing detection has mainly been focused on analyzing the luminance of the face images, hence discarding the chrominance information which can be useful for discriminating fake faces from genuine ones.

In general, a square-sized patch is used to find the LR-HR correspondences in the dictionaries. However, this may be a difficult issue because the LR input image and the dictionaries are of different scales. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel self-example-based SR method, using context-dependent multi-shaped subpatches. Each LR input patch is segmented into multiple subpatches according to the context of the patch, enabling us to extract the better LR-HR correspondences. Our experimental results show that the proposed subpatch-based SR generates competitive high-quality HR images compared to state-of-the-art methods, with visually sharper edges that result in better visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351320","startPage":"2835","endPage":"2839","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351320.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single image super-resolution based on self-examples using context-dependent subpatches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Single image super-resolution based on self-examples using context-dependent subpatches","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351320/","accessionNumber":"15654392","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351320/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single image super-resolution based on self-examples using context-dependent subpatches","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388mASF301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049119S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351325,"authors":[{"name":"Masatoshi Kimura","affiliation":["Chubu University 1200, Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37085648284"},{"name":"Takayoshi Yamashita","affiliation":["Chubu University 1200, Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai"],"firstName":"Takayoshi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37085338365"},{"name":"Yuji Yamauchi","affiliation":["Chubu University 1200, Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37528280700"},{"name":"Hironobu Fujiyoshi","affiliation":["Chubu University 1200, Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai"],"firstName":"Hironobu","lastName":"Fujiyoshi","id":"37270300700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351325","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Face","Robustness","Neural networks","Real-time systems","Shape","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","neural nets","object detection","pose estimation","real-time systems","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial point detection","convolutional neural network","optimal minibatch procedure","CNN","facial pose","real-time processing","subset with augmentation","random selection","fixed-person subset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural network","mini-batch","facial points","random selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351325","abstract":"We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method to ensure both robustness to variations in facial pose and real-time processing.

We demonstrate a manner of providing samples that results in a better network. We consider four methods: 1) subset with augmentation, 2) random selection, 3) fixed-person subset, and 4) the conventional approach. Experimental results indicate that the subset with augmentation technique has sufficient variations and quantity to obtain the best performance. Our CNN-based method is robust under facial pose variations, and achieves better performance.

Conventional deep neuron networks were generally trained by the end-to-end supervised learning framework, whose performance is restricted by the training problems, such as the gradient vanishing problem, leading to less discriminative features, especially in lower layers. Instead, we build a novel objective function with two kinds of companion losses. The advantages of this framework are as follows: Firstly, it facilities the optimization by solving the gradient vanishing problem. Secondly, both kinds of companion supervised information contribute to obtain more discriminative features. Finally, a good initialization for fine-tuning could be obtained with the aid of the companion supervised training.

Our main goal with this work is to show the accuracy and efficiency improvements that these relatively new techniques can provide for the segmentation of breast masses from mammograms. We also propose an easily reproducible quantitative analysis to assess the performance of breast mass segmentation methodologies based on widely accepted accuracy and running time measurements on public datasets, which will facilitate further comparisons for this segmentation problem. In particular, we use two publicly available datasets (DDSM-BCRP and INbreast) and propose the computation of the running time taken for the methodology to produce a mass segmentation given an input image and the use of the Dice index to quantitatively measure the segmentation accuracy. For both databases, we show that our proposed methodology produces competitive results in terms of accuracy and running time.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351343","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351343.pdf","startPage":"2950","endPage":"2954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep structured learning for mass segmentation from mammograms","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351343/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351343/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep structured learning for mass segmentation from mammograms","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388mtsA11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048308S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7351352,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Ito","affiliation":["Research Division of Intelligence and Information Sciences, Utsunomiya Univ., Utsunomiya, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Ito","id":"37270018600"},{"name":"Shungo Yasaka","affiliation":["Research Division of Intelligence and Information Sciences, Utsunomiya Univ., Utsunomiya, Japan"],"firstName":"Shungo","lastName":"Yasaka","id":"37085745830"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Yamada","affiliation":["Research Division of Intelligence and Information Sciences, Utsunomiya Univ., Utsunomiya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37336767700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351352","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Fourier transforms","Trajectory","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MR image reconstruction","undersampled signal","quadratic phase scrambling","fast image reconstruction method","random sampling","CS","aliasing artifact","under-sampling","Fourier transform imaging","sampling trajectory","signal-to-noise ratio","compressed sensing reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aliasing","compressed sensing","sampling","Fresnel transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351352","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new fast image reconstruction method in which a regularly undersampled signal is used instead of random sampling, as is used in compressed sensing (CS).

We observe that the approach based on random hyperplanes produces the best results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351371","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351371.pdf","startPage":"3087","endPage":"3091","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time dynamic texture recognition using random sampling and dimension reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time dynamic texture recognition using random sampling and dimension reduction","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7351371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654368","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351371/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time dynamic texture recognition using random sampling and dimension reduction","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388nUaS141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089346S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351375,"authors":[{"name":"Yea-Shuan Huang","affiliation":["Deptartment of CSIE, Chung-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yea-Shuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536895300"},{"name":"Suen-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Deptartment of CSIE, Chung-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Suen-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085615161"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":708},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face","Feature extraction","Image recognition","Databases","Encoding","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","face recognition","image matching","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Feret face databases","bilateral recognition score","geometrical models","image matching","feature point search","reference image","feature point detection","backward recognition","forward recognition","BR approach","feature-point bilateral recognition approach","enrolled face image","input face image","weighting mechanism","LVP","local vector pattern","two-stage face recognition method","geometrical-model-based face recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Geometrical Model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel two-stage face recognition method. The first stage implements a newly proposed feature, called Local Vector Pattern (LVP), and with a weighting mechanism, LVP is used to compute the distance between an input face image and each enrolled face image, so that M possible face candidates can be decided. Then, the second stage uses a novel feature-point Bilateral Recognition (BR) approach to produce the final face recognition result from the M candidates. Bilateral recognition contains both forward and backward recognition, and each recognition uses the feature points detected in its reference image, and searches their individual corresponding feature points in its matched image. The geometrical models of the detected feature points and their matched ones are respectively constructed and compared. By summing up the scores of both forward and backward recognition, a bilateral recognition score is obtained and is used to produce the final recognition result. Experiments on the famous Feret face databases show that the proposed algorithm produce an excellent recognition result and performs much better than two other well-known face recognition methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A geometrical-model-based face recognition","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351375","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351375.pdf","startPage":"3106","endPage":"3110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A geometrical-model-based face recognition","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351375/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A geometrical-model-based face recognition","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388o25S301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058563S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351377,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher A.

The last three decades have seen extensive research devoted to this arena, and as a result, today's denoisers are highly optimized algorithms that effectively remove large amounts of additive white Gaussian noise. A compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired from a small number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms can be cast as iteratively estimating a signal from a perturbed observation. This paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic denoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, we develop a denoising-based approximate message passing (D-AMP) algorithm that is capable of high-performance reconstruction. We demonstrate using the high performance BM3D denoiser that D-AMP offers state-of-the-art CS recovery performance for natural images (on average 9dB better than sparsity-based algorithms), while operating tens of times faster than the only competitive method. A critical insight in our approach is the use of an appropriate Onsager correction term in the D-AMP iterations, which coerces the signal perturbation at each iteration to be very close to the white Gaussian noise that denoisers are typically designed to remove. On the analytical side, we develop a new state evolution framework for deterministic signals that accurately predicts the performance of D-AMP and enables us to derive several useful theoretical features.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351377","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351377.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351377","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","startPage":"3116","endPage":"3120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BM3D-AMP: A new image recovery algorithm based on BM3D denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"BM3D-AMP: A new image recovery algorithm based on BM3D denoising","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351377/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351377/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654423","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BM3D-AMP: A new image recovery algorithm based on BM3D denoising","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388o6oE151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118165S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7351383,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Am\u00e1vel Pinheiro","affiliation":["Dept. of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miguel Am\u00e1vel","lastName":"Pinheiro","id":"37085481933"},{"name":"Jan Kybic","affiliation":["Dept. of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kybic","id":"37271777700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351383","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351383","abstract":"Many medical images contain graph-like geometrical structures such as blood vessels and neuronal networks.

The underlying hypothesis that we ought to validate is that traffic images are heavily characterized by their 2D spatial textures. In that perspective, we tested different 2D texture features and machine learning methods to see how accurate such an approach can be. We also performed a regression on the image descriptor in order to estimate traffic density. Experimental results obtained on the UCSD traffic dataset reveal that our approach generalizes well to various weather and lighting conditions.

Although many algorithms have been proposed to remove the haze, not much effort has been made on quality assessment of dehazed images. In this paper, we first build a database that contains 25 hazy images as well as dehazed images created by eight dehazing algorithms. A subjective user study is then carried out based on the database, from which we have several useful findings. First, considerable agreement between human subjects on the perceived quality of hazy and dehazed images is observed. Second, not a single dehazing algorithm performs the best for all test images. Third, existing objective image quality assessment (IQA) models are very limited in providing proper quality predictions of dehazed images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351475","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351475.pdf","startPage":"3600","endPage":"3604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual evaluation of single image dehazing algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351475/","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual evaluation of single image dehazing algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654548","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351475/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual evaluation of single image dehazing algorithms","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388rtJM2312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072937S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351481,"authors":[{"name":"Qingxiang Feng","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Qingxiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37890138700"},{"name":"Chun Yuan","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37289486000"},{"name":"Jiawen Huang","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085664058"},{"name":"Weifeng Li","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Weifeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37309719300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Linear regression","Databases","Training","Face recognition","Classification algorithms","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","matrix algebra","regression analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["center-based weighted kernel linear regression classification","image classification","linear regression representation","kernel ridge regression classification","KRRC","KLRC","nearest regularized subspace","NRS","CWKLR","Tikhonov matrix","Coil100 object database","Eth80 object database","GT face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear Regression","Ridge Regression","Nearest Regularized Subspace","Object Recognition","Face Recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351481","abstract":"Recently, the linear regression classification (LRC) has been proposed. LRC uses linear regression representation of each class for classification. Based on LRC, a few improved methods are proposed, such as kernel linear regression classification (KLRC), kernel ridge regression classification (KRRC) and nearest regularized subspace (NRS). Motivated by the LRC, KLRC, KRRC and NRS, center-based weighted kernel linear regression (CWKLR) is proposed for image classification in this paper. CWKLR firstly constitutes the center-based kernel matrix based on the KLRC and KRRC. Next, CWKLR utilizes the Tikhonov Matrix to solve the weighted projection coefficients for classification. Experiments on Coil100 object database, Eth80 object database and GT face database are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve better recognition rate than some state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351481","startPage":"3630","endPage":"3634","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351481.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Center-based weighted kernel linear regression for image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Center-based weighted kernel linear regression for image classification","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351481/","accessionNumber":"15653791","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351481/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Center-based weighted kernel linear regression for image classification","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388rXdP151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063586S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351501,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085682840"},{"name":"Ronggang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"],"firstName":"Ronggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37422840900"},{"name":"Wenmin Wang","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wenmin","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085689098"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351501","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2701},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Mathematical model","Standards","Image enhancement","Image segmentation","Noise measurement","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gradient methods","image denoising","image enhancement","image filtering","image segmentation","image texture","smoothing methods","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dehazing process","adaptive enhancement parameter","detail-preserved image","noise-free image","structural filter","inverted image","first order differential","layer extraction","BM3D filter","smooth base layer","noise-texture level estimation","local gradients","local standard deviation","superpixels","low-light image segmentation","contrast enhancement","contrast enlarging","image denoising","low-light image enhancement method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contrast enhancement","adaptive denoising","superpixel","dark channel","BM3D"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel united low-light image enhancement framework for both contrast enhancement and denoising is proposed. First, the low-light image is segmented into superpixels, and the ratio between the local standard deviation and the local gradients is utilized to estimate the noise-texture level of each superpixel. Then the image is inverted to be processed in the following steps. Based on the noise-texture level, a smooth base layer is adaptively extracted by the BM3D filter, and another detail layer is extracted by the first order differential of the inverted image and smoothed with the structural filter. These two layers are adaptively combined to get a noise-free and detail-preserved image. At last, an adaptive enhancement parameter is adopt into the dark channel prior dehazing process to enlarge contrast and prevent over/under enhancement.

However, degraded face images, acquired in the real-world, make face recognition difficult. In this paper, we propose a new face image quality assessment that aims to realize a robust and reliable face recognition system. The proposed method considers two factors for face image quality, i.e., visual quality and mismatch between training and test face images. A face image quality assessor is learned based on the two factors to discriminate useful faces from unuseful ones. The proposed face image quality assessment model is robust and adaptive to face recognition systems by employing a learned assessment. Our experimental results on a challenging database show significant improvement in face recognition accuracy by the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351562","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","startPage":"4027","endPage":"4031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face image assessment learned with objective and relative face image qualities for improved face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face image assessment learned with objective and relative face image qualities for improved face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351562/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654518","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7351562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face image assessment learned with objective and relative face image qualities for improved face recognition","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388uHe3291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059393S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351567,"authors":[{"name":"Fania Mokhayeri","affiliation":["LIVIA, Universit\u00e9 du Ou\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Fania","lastName":"Mokhayeri","id":"37085735636"},{"name":"Eric Granger","affiliation":["LIVIA, Universit\u00e9 du Ou\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Granger","id":"37352096000"},{"name":"Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau","affiliation":["LITIV, Poly technique Montreal, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Guillaume-Alexandre","lastName":"Bilodeau","id":"37424340100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351567","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"In still-to-video face recognition (FR), the faces captured with surveillance cameras are matched against reference stills of target individuals enrolled to the system. FR is a challenging problem in video surveillance due to uncontrolled capture conditions (variations in pose, expression, illumination, blur, scale, etc.), and the limited number of reference stills to model target individuals. This paper introduces a new approach to generate multiple synthetic face images per reference still based on camera-specific capture conditions to deal with illumination variations. For each reference still, a diverse set of faces from non-target individuals appearing in the camera viewpoint are selected based on luminance and contrast distortion. These face images are then decomposed into detail layer and large scale layer using an edge-preserving image decomposition to obtain their illumination dependent component. Finally, the large scale layers of these images are morphed with each reference still image to generate multiple synthetic reference stills that incorporate illumination and contrast conditions. Experimental results obtained with the ChokePoint dataset reveal that these synthetic faces produce an enhanced face model. As the number of synthetic faces grows, the proposed approach provides a higher level of accuracy and robustness across a range of capture conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Lighting","Cameras","Video surveillance","Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","face recognition","image capture","image matching","image morphing","image segmentation","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational conditions","video surveillance","still-to-video face recognition","face capture","surveillance camera","face matching","pose variation","expression variation","illumination variation","blur","synthetic face image generation","reference still","camera-specific capture condition","camera viewpoint","luminance distortion","contrast distortion","face image decomposition","detail layer","large scale layer","edge-preserving image decomposition","illumination dependent component","image morphing","ChokePoint dataset","face model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Surveillance","Face Recognition","Image Morphing","Synthetic face generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351567","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351567.pdf","startPage":"4052","endPage":"4056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic face generation under various operational conditions in video surveillance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic face generation under various operational conditions in video surveillance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351567/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351567/","accessionNumber":"15654193","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic face generation under various operational conditions in video surveillance","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388uM2g141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058829S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351579,"authors":[{"name":"ZongYuan Ge","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia","Australian Centre for Robotic Vision, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"ZongYuan","lastName":"Ge","id":"37086431296"},{"name":"Chris McCool","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia","Australian Centre for Robotic Vision, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"McCool","id":"38274733400"},{"name":"Conrad Sanderson","affiliation":["NICTA, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Conrad","lastName":"Sanderson","id":"37269421000"},{"name":"Peter Corke","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia","Australian Centre for Robotic Vision, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Corke","id":"37279654600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351579","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":504},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351579","abstract":"We propose a local modelling approach using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fine-grained image classification. Recently, deep CNNs trained from large datasets have considerably improved the performance of object recognition. However, to date there has been limited work using these deep CNNs as local feature extractors. This partly stems from CNNs having internal representations which are high dimensional, thereby making such representations difficult to model using stochastic models. To overcome this issue, we propose to reduce the dimensionality of one of the internal fully connected layers, in conjunction with layer-restricted retraining to avoid retraining the entire network. The distribution of low-dimensional features obtained from the modified layer is then modelled using a Gaussian mixture model. Comparative experiments show that considerable performance improvements can be achieved on the challenging Fish and UEC FOOD-100 datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351579","startPage":"4112","endPage":"4116","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351579.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling local deep convolutional neural network features to improve fine-grained image classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Adaptation models","Training","Covariance matrices","Protocols","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image classification","mixture models","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local deep convolutional neural network feature modelling approach","fine-grained image classification","deep CNN","object recognition","local feature extractors","stochastic models","dimensionality reduction","layer-restricted retraining","low-dimensional feature distribution","Gaussian mixture model","Fish datasets","UEC FOOD-100 datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fine-grained classification","deep convolutional neural networks","session variation modelling","Gaussian mixture models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modelling local deep convolutional neural network features to improve fine-grained image classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351579/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15653831","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling local deep convolutional neural network features to improve fine-grained image classification","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388uXjF131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07978S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7351598,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Jia","affiliation":["University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, US"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Jia"},{"name":"Keigo Hirakawa","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Hirakawa","id":"37295032600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351598","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Fourier transforms","Arrays","Image color analysis","Sensors","Yttrium","Hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","hyperspectral imaging","image colour analysis","image filtering","image resolution","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband filtering","SFA","spectral filter array","spatial resolution","MSI","material spectral characteristics","HSI","hyperspectral imaging","color imaging","single-shot Fourier transform multispectroscopy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","multispectral imaging","spectral filter array","demosaicking"]}],"abstract":"Compared to color imaging, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has a significant advantage in identifying the objects based on their material spectral characteristics.

The performance of the proposed scheme is verified using both synthetic data and natural images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351628.pdf","startPage":"4352","endPage":"4356","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-resolution compressed sensing reconstruction via approximate message passing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Sparse matrices","Sensitivity","Signal resolution","Compressed sensing","Message passing","Reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image resolution","mean square error methods","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution compressed sensing reconstruction","approximate message passing","high resolution signal","low resolution signal","AMP-based solution","MR-AMP","mean squared error","MSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","approximate message passing","multi-resolution","state evolution","phase transition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-resolution compressed sensing reconstruction via approximate message passing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351628/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654335","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-resolution compressed sensing reconstruction via approximate message passing","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388WAEw291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07729S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351632,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Zheng","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085413842"},{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085385864"},{"name":"Sunil Prasad Jaiswal","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Sunil Prasad","lastName":"Jaiswal","id":"38239921200"},{"name":"Oscar C.

Then, we employ a graph cut algorithm to efficiently solve the global labeling problem with candidate labels.

Locations of object occurrences are returned as spatio-temporal trajectories in the 3D video volume. Despite much work on object instance search in image datasets, these methods locate the object independently in each image, therefore do not preserve the spatio-temporal consistency in consecutive video frames. This results in sub-optimal performance if directly applied to videos, as will be shown in our experiments. We propose to locate the object jointly across video frames using spatio-temporal search. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a consumer video dataset consisting of crawled YouTube videos and mobile captured consumer clips. Our method significantly improves the localized search accuracy over the baseline, which treats each frame independently. Moreover, it is able to find the top 100 object trajectories in the 5.5-hour dataset within 30 seconds.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351634","startPage":"4381","endPage":"4385","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351634.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast object instance search in videos from one example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast object instance search in videos from one example","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351634/","accessionNumber":"15654434","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351634/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast object instance search in videos from one example","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388wLin301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065404S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7351640,"authors":[{"name":"Vladan Popovic","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vladan","lastName":"Popovic","id":"38546880900"},{"name":"Yusuf Leblebici","affiliation":["Ecole Poly technique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Leblebici","id":"37085363266"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351640","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351640","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Random access memory","Clocks","Real-time systems","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal downsampling","pyramidal image decomposition","FPGA hardware accelerator","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a pyramidal decomposition system suitable for high frame rate and real-time applications.

The visual content is commonly represented by N texture and depth map pairs that capture different viewpoints. A server selects an appropriate subset of M \u2264 N views for transmission, so that the user can freely navigate in the corresponding window of viewpoints without being affected by network delay. During navigation, a user can synthesize any intermediate virtual view image in the navigation window via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) using two nearby camera views as references. When the available bandwidth is too small to transmit all camera views typically used to synthesize views in the navigation window, we propose to synthesize intermediate virtual views as new references for transmission - a resampling of viewpoints for the 3D scene - so that the synthesized view distortion within the navigation window is minimized. We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem to find the best set of M virtual views to synthesize as new references, and show that the problem is NP-hard. We approximate the original problem with a new reference view equivalence model and derive in this case an optimal dynamic programming algorithm to determine the best set of M views to be transmitted to each user. Experimental results show that synthesizing virtual views as new references for client-side view synthesis can outperform simple selection from camera views by up to 0.73dB in synthesized view quality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Cameras","Navigation","Servers","Streaming media","Three-dimensional displays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

The HSI data cube is first modeled as a dense low-rank tensor plus a sparse tensor. Based on the obtained low-rank tensor, LTDD further decomposes the low-rank tensor using Tucker decomposition to extract the core tensor which is treated as the \u201csupport\u201d of the anomaly spectral signatures. LTDD then adopts an unmixing approach to the reconstructed core tensor for anomaly detection.

In BCS, reconstructing the sparse signal and estimating the sparsifying basis proceeds simultaneously. Best results in CS based dynamic MRI reconstruction have been achieved when both spatial correlation and temporal redundancies were exploited. Prior studies in BCS dynamic MRI reconstruction either accounted for spatial redundancy or temporal correlation, but not both. In this work, we propose to jointly exploit spatio-temporal correlation within the BCS framework. The improvement in reconstruction results is significant compared to prior BCS techniques in dynamic MRI.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351668","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","startPage":"4550","endPage":"4554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning space-time dictionaries for blind compressed sensing dynamic MRI reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning space-time dictionaries for blind compressed sensing dynamic MRI reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351668/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654194","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7351668/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning space-time dictionaries for blind compressed sensing dynamic MRI reconstruction","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388xGrj121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076668S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351679,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Sanchez","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37394525300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351679","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351679","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Videos","Prediction algorithms","Image edge detection","Optimization","Standards","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","optimisation","prediction theory","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEVC intraprediction coding","computational complexity","rate distortion optimization","DPCM-based angular intraprediction","SC video lossless coding","sample-wise intraprediction method","SAP-ME","sample-based angular prediction","screen content video generation","sample-wise edge prediction","sample-wise median prediction","lossless screen content coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC lossless intra-prediction coding","screen content","DPCM","edge predictor","median predictor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351679","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351679.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","startPage":"4604","endPage":"4608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless screen content coding in HEVC based on sample-wise median and edge prediction","abstract":"The generation of screen content (SC) videos has considerably increased with the popularity of multimedia applications such as video conferencing, remote desktop sharing and remote education. SC videos, as opposed to natural video sequences, are challenging to compress due to the high number of sharp edges. This paper proposes the sample-based angular prediction with median and edge prediction (SAP-ME), a novel intra-prediction method for lossless coding of SC videos. SAP-ME incorporates the advantages of three types of sample-wise intra-prediction; namely, DPCM-based angular intra-prediction, median prediction and edge prediction. By using rate distortion optimization, SAP-ME selects among these three types of predictions to accurately predict directional patterns, smooth regions and sharp edges, with a low computational complexity. Evaluation results on a variety of SC videos show that SAP-ME attains average bit-rate reductions of 16.13% over current HEVC intra-prediction coding for lossless coding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351679/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15654579","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351679/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lossless screen content coding in HEVC based on sample-wise median and edge prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless screen content coding in HEVC based on sample-wise median and edge prediction","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388xP9m151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071809S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7351687,"authors":[{"name":"Luis G.

From a lenselet image, light field can be reconstructed, with which we can render images with different viewpoints and focal length. Because of large volume data, high efficient image compression scheme for storage and transmission is urgent. Containing 4D light field information, lenselet images have much more redundant information than traditional 2D images.

Here, each CNN column takes input from one of the regions discovered. The column of the CNN is gated such that in the backpropagation of the learning process, classification error due to less relevant attributes do not over influence the learning process. In the experiment, we manually labeled each image in the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark dataset with 40 face attributes and obtained significant performance improvement over other state-of-the art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face attribute classification using attribute-aware correlation map and gated convolutional neural networks","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351743","startPage":"4922","endPage":"4926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350743","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7328364/7350743/07351743.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Face attribute classification using attribute-aware correlation map and gated convolutional neural networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351743/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15654094","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face attribute classification using attribute-aware correlation map and gated convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388Zavs311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052709S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351749,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Tsung Peng","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"firstName":"Yan-Tsung","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085998714"},{"name":"Xiangyun Zhao","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088046808"},{"name":"Pamela C.

It employs some new coding tools and algorithms (including palette coding mode, intra block copy mode, adaptive color transform, adaptive motion compensation precision, etc.), and outperforms HEVC by over 40% bitrate reduction on typical screen contents. However, enormous computational complexity is introduced on encoder primarily due to heavy optimization processing, especially rate distortion optimization (RDO) for Coding Unit (CU) partition decision and mode selection. This paper proposes a novel machine learning based approach for fast CU partition decision using features that describe CU statistics and sub-CU homogeneity. The proposed scheme is implemented as a \"preprocessing\" module on top of the Screen Content Coding reference software (SCM-3.0). Compared with SCM-3.0, experimental results show that our scheme can achieve 36.8% complexity reduction on average with only 3.0% BD-rate increase over 11 JCT-VC testing sequences when encoded using \"All Intra\" (AI) configuration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351753/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15653782","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7351753/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast CU partition decision using machine learning for screen content compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast CU partition decision using machine learning for screen content compression","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"388ZquY151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057855S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7328364","isNumber":"7350743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7328364","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7350743","articleId":"7351753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":7351765,"authors":[{"name":"Hashan R.

The communication overhead of these systems becomes a bottleneck as the number of processing elements in the network and workload increase. State-of-the art in decentralised resource management techniques address this issue by allowing individual or clusters of nodes to make decisions at runtime to manage the dynamic workload. The primary contribution of this paper is using a bio-inspired, distributed, task remapping technique to manage dynamic multiple video stream decoding workloads. Our proposed technique has a low-communication overhead and is used to reduce the cumulative job lateness of the video streams. Secondary contributions include, several improvements to an existing clusterbased resource management approach to introduce awareness of task blocking and relocation distance. We evaluate these two remapping methods by comparing the improvement of job lateness, communication overhead and distribution of utilisation via simulation of several workload patterns.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired distributed task remapping for multiple video stream decoding on homogeneous NoCs","publicationTitle":"2015 13th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems For Real-time Multimedia (ESTIMedia)","doi":"10.1109/ESTIMedia.2015.7351765","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 13th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems For Real-time Multimedia (ESTIMedia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7312647/7351757/07351765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTIMedia.2015.7351765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7351757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired distributed task remapping for multiple video stream decoding on homogeneous NoCs","conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351765/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"October 2015","accessionNumber":"15663600","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired distributed task remapping for multiple video stream decoding on homogeneous NoCs","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"2_R1_2_pp19_28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070637S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7312647","isNumber":"7351757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7312647","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7351757","articleId":"7351765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7351771,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Lifa","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Lifa","id":"37945932200"},{"name":"Petru Eles","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petru","lastName":"Eles","id":"37278884400"},{"name":"Zebo Peng","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zebo","lastName":"Peng","id":"37278887200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8164-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9395-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351771","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351771","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Real-time systems","Computer architecture","Energy consumption","Processor scheduling","Optimization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","graphics processing units","microprocessor chips","power aware computing","processor scheduling","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-the-fly energy minimization","multimode real-time systems","heterogeneous platforms","multimedia systems","heterogeneous architectures","complex multimedia applications","automotive systems","image processing","active-safety features","real-time multimode systems","computational requirements","intelligent online resource management","heterogeneous resources","energy-efficient system","real-time constraints","resource manager","run-time policies","on-the-fly task admission","active task mapping","energy consumption minimization","CPU","GPU","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"The increasing computational demands of next generation multimedia systems require innovative optimization methods. Modern heterogeneous architectures bring together multiple general-purpose CPUs and multiple GPUs and FPGAs, in an attempt to answer the performance, energy-efficiency and flexibility requirements of today's complex multimedia applications. However, in order to leverage the advantages of such architectures, careful optimization is essential. In modern systems, more and more multimedia applications need real-time support (e.g. automotive systems that use image processing for active safety features). Real-time multi-mode systems are a good model for a wide range of applications that dynamically change their computational requirements over time. In this context, intelligent on-line resource management is needed, such that the heterogeneous resources are used in an energy-efficient manner, while meeting the real-time constraints.

The designs' scalability allows the user to program and implement different applications with variable number of neurons, starting from one neuron to the maximum number of neurons in any layer, this is performed with programming-like ease and flexibility.

The Neural Network has witnessed significant improvement since 1943 to date. However, modifications on the Neural Network mainly focus on the structure itself, not the activation function despite the critical role of activation function in the performance of the Neural Network. In this paper, we present the modification of Neural Network activation function to improve the performance of the Neural Network. The theoretical background of the modification, including mathematical proof is fully described in the paper. The modified activation function is code name as SigHyper. The performance of SigHyper was evaluated against state of the art activation function on the crude oil price dataset. Results suggested that the proposed SigHyper was found to improved accuracy of the Neural Network. Analysis of variance showed that the accuracy of the SigHyper is significant. It was established that the SigHyper require further improvement. The activation function proposed in this research has added to the activation functions already discussed in the literature. The study may motivate researchers to further modify activation functions, hence, improve the performance of the Neural Network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351806/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15662235","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7351806/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modified Neural Network Activation Function","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Neural Network Activation Function","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"7910a008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128892S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7347855","isNumber":"7351793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347855","xplore-issue":"7351793","articleId":"7351806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7351809,"authors":[{"name":"Abdollah Ansari","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Bangi Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abdollah","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37085744570"},{"name":"Azuraliza Abu Bakar","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence Technology (CAIT), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Bangi Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Azuraliza Abu","lastName":"Bakar","id":"37684581000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7910-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7909-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351809","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":725},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Job shop scheduling","Optimization","Artificial intelligence","Fuzzy logic","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","neural nets","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence techniques","genetic algorithm","neural network","fuzzy logic","scheduling problem","scheduling process","academic institutes","time optimization","time table","resource consumption optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence; Scheduling Problem; Genetic Algorithm; Neural Network; Fuzzy logic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7351809","abstract":"Since scheduling process is an important and complicated process, many programmers have been searching and working on this issue for years.

During PSC, the P-V characteristic becomes more complex with multiple maximum power points (MPP). Most of the conventional MPPT approaches will be trapped at the local MPP and hence limiting the maximum power generation. As such, the investigation on particle swarm optimization (PSO) based MPPT is carried out to maximize the PV generated power principally under PSC operation. The performances of conventional MPPT approach and the proposed PSO-MPPT are investigated particularly on the transient and steady state responses under various shaded conditions. The simulation results show that the PSO-MPPT is able to facilitate the PV array to reach the global MPP as well as to assist the PV array to produce more stable output power compared to the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICAIET.2014.48","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347855/7351793/07351842.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"252","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology","publicationTitle":"2014 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIET.2014.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7351793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Power Point Tracking of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Arrays Using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7351842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Power Point Tracking of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Arrays Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15655021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7351842/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Power Point Tracking of Partially Shaded Photovoltaic Arrays Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"7910a247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.176504S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7347855","isNumber":"7351793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347855","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7351793","articleId":"7351842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7351895,"authors":[{"name":"Mazen Al Haddad","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Mazen Al","lastName":"Haddad","id":"37085750586"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37085353909"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7186-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7185-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7351895","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Interference","Power control","Power measurement","Propagation losses","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","environmental factors","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["green power control framework","high dense neighboring femtocell grid","dense HetNet","5G communication","macrocell BS","macro-femto interference mitigation problem","femto-femto interference mitigation problem","network capacity","power consumption reduction","CO2 footprint reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Small Cells","Femtocell Technology","LTE Advanced","HetNet","RES"]}],"abstract":"High dense neighboring Femtocells are seen as future low-cost solution to significantly gain capacity compared to Macro-only deployment. Dense HetNet, which requires progressive introduction of Femtocells, offers scalable networks towards 1000 fold gains in capacity as per technology vision for 5G. In such dense networks, the problem of interference comes between the Macrocells and Femtocells as well as among the Femtocells themselves. Valuable insights in the Macro-Femto interference are available, while the Femto-Femto interference aspects remain partially addressed. This paper outlines this problem and points potential solution strategies to mitigate the Femto-Femto interference, increase the network capacity, decrease the power consumption and likewise reduce the CO2 footprint. According to the system level simulation of our novel power control framework, user throughput is 15,9% to 49,3% greater than that of the conventional power control schemas.

In this paper, we present a cognitive radio enabled smart grid architecture. We then discuss major cyber security challenges in smart grid deployment and additional challenges introduced by cognitive radio technology. Spectrum sensing is one of the important aspect for opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio enabled smart grid networks. Cooperative spectrum sensing can improve the sensing performance in which multiple cognitive radio users cooperate to sense primary user bands. However, cooperative spectrum sensing is vulnerable to incumbent emulation and spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks.

Recently, the first theoretical discussion on the IMI effect and the corresponding frequency-domain channel estimation method for polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) coherent optical OFDM/OQAM (CO-OFDM/OQAM) system has been studied. The full-loaded and the half-loaded channel estimation methods have been proposed to mitigate the IMI effect. However, for these frequency-domain methods, the condition that the symbol interval is much longer than the maximum channel delay spread has to be satisfied. When the transmission distance is long, the frequency-domain residual errors induced by the chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) reduce the channel estimation accuracy evidently. In this paper, we systematically discuss the time-domain channel transmission model for PDM CO-OFDM/OQAM systems. With the analysis of the distribution of the received additive noise, we propose the time-domain least square (TDLS) channel estimation method for PDM CO-OFDM/OQAM systems. Compared with the frequency-domain methods, the TDLS method promotes the system robustness against both the IMI effect and the additive noise significantly. The computational complexities and the transmission performance have been compared for both the TDLS and the frequency-domain full-loaded methods. The theoretical analysis is validated by numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the PDM CO-OFDM/OQAM system.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2507605","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7404307/07352298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2507605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404307","startPage":"891","endPage":"900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Least Square Channel Estimation for Polarization-Division-Multiplexed CO-OFDM/OQAM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Least Square Channel Estimation for Polarization-Division-Multiplexed CO-OFDM/OQAM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15786166","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7352298/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61475004 and 61535002"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of ZTE Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Least Square Channel Estimation for Polarization-Division-Multiplexed CO-OFDM/OQAM Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2507605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09009S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7404307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7404307","articleId":"7352298","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7352306,"authors":[{"name":"Bobak Shahriari","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7360840/7352306/shahr-2494218-small.gif","p":["\nBobak Shahriari is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, under the supervision of N. de Freitas and A.

The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"104","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15678234","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7352306/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Taking the Human Out of the Loop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Taking the Human Out of the Loop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization","sourcePdf":"jproc-shahriari-2494218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.231381S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7360840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1030","xplore-issue":"7360840","articleId":"7352306","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7352308,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Idzikowski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7475979/7352308/idzik-2507789-small.gif","p":["Filip Idzikowski received the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Poznan University of Technology (PUT), Pozna\u0144, Poland and Dublin City University (DCU), Dublin 9, Ireland, and the Ph.D. degree (Dr.-Ing.) from the Technical University of Berlin (TUB), Berlin, Germany, in 2005 and 2014, respectively.

We focus on the design and operation stages, i.e., deciding which devices to install in the network during the former step, and choosing which devices to put into sleep mode during the latter one. A taxonomy for classifying the surveyed approaches is provided in order to compare the works covering energy efficiency in core networks (in terms of both optimal formulations and heuristic solutions). Moreover, our work provides a global view of the traffic assumptions, the topologies, and the power consumption models in the literature. The need of further investigations in this field clearly emerges. We envision future works targeting: (1) more effective standardization efforts to practically realize sleep modes; (2) the evaluation of the impact of sleep mode on the device lifetime; (3) the extensive adoption of new paradigms like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and EON; and (4) a radical improvement in the testbed implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16033988","htmlLink":"/document/7352308/","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Energy-Aware Design and Operation of Core Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Polish National Science Center","grantNumber":"DEC-2014/12/S/ST7/00415"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Energy-Aware Design and Operation of Core Networks","sourcePdf":"comst-idzikowski-2507789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.591695S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7475979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7475979","articleId":"7352308","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7352309,"authors":[{"name":"Gangyong Jia","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, China","Department of Computer Science, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7352309/jia-2507576-small.gif","p":["Gangyong Jia (M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2013.

In addition, the cloud computing provides flexible allocation, migration of services, and better security isolation; therefore, it is the infrastructure for the smart cities. Single instruction-set architecture (ISA) heterogeneous multi-core processors have higher performance per watt than their symmetric counterparts and are popular in current processors. In current cloud computing, which integrates a few fast out-of-order cores, coupled with a large number of simpler, slow cores, all cores expose the same ISA. The best way to leverage the effectiveness of these systems is to accelerate sequential CPU-bound threads using fast cores, and to improve the throughput of parallel memory-bound threads using slow cores. However, shared hardware resources, such as memory, respond to requests from all cores, which interfere with each other, leading to both low speed for fast cores and low throughput for slow cores. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource partitioning (DRP) method for single-ISA heterogeneous multi-cores, which partitions the shared resources according to both threads' requirements for the shared resources and the performance of their running cores. The key principle is to profile both threads' resource characteristics at run-time and the performance of the cores that the threads are running on to estimate demands for resources. Then, we use the estimation to direct our resource partitioning. Moreover, we integrate our DRP with current memory scheduling policies to improve the system performance further for the two methods being orthogonal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-Core-Based Cloud Computing in Smart Cities","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2507576","startPage":"108","endPage":"118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2507576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07352309.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352309","topic":"Smart Cities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-Core-Based Cloud Computing in Smart Cities","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7352309/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15819606","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572172 and 61572262"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"BK20140248"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial of Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"LQ14F020011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Dynamic Resource Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-Core-Based Cloud Computing in Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"access-han-2507576-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123958S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Smart Cities"],"articleId":"7352309","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7352313,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Nevertheless, solutions employed in core networks are prohibitively complex and costly, requiring the optical complexity of the coherent receivers to be reduced to make them feasible for access networks. For monolithic integration, a key challenge is posed by the polarization beam splitter (PBS). If, however, the PBS is removed, the receiver needs to be redesigned to be insensitive to the incoming polarization state of the received signal. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a polarization-insensitive (i.e., polarization-independent) coherent receiver for the optical network unit in passive optical networks (PONs). The receiver consists of only a 3-dB coupler and a single-balanced photodiode such that the complexity is comparable to a direct detection receiver. The proposed cost-effective coherent receiver is implemented by using the Alamouti polarization-time block coding scheme combined with heterodyne detection. To verify the technique, the Alamouti-coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is rotated over the full Poincar\u00e9 sphere. Compared to the dual-polarization-OFDM signal operating at a net bit rate of 10 Gb/s per polarization (a gross bit rate of 10.7 Gb/s including a 7% FEC overhead), only a 0.6 dB sensitivity degradation is observed. The sensitivity at the FEC threshold, assumed to be 4\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n, is measured to be -41.5 dBm (56 photons-per-bit) on a 25-GHz grid. Following this, different channel spacings are investigated and the signal is transmitted over 80 km of standard single-mode fiber in a long-reach wavelength division multiplexed PON system. The loss budgets are found to be 43.0 and 42.8 dB for 50- and 25-GHz grids, respectively.","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7425114/07352313.pdf","startPage":"2034","endPage":"2041","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7425114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2507869","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2507869","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352313","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Optical network units","Optical polarization","Optical receivers","Optical sensors","Optical mixing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","forward error correction","heterodyne detection","light polarisation","OFDM modulation","optical beam splitters","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical signal detection","passive optical networks","photodiodes","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss budgets","long-reach wavelength division multiplexed system","standard single-mode fiber","FEC threshold","dual-polarization-OFDM signal","full Poincar\u00e9 sphere","Alamouti-coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","heterodyne detection","Alamouti polarization-time block coding scheme","direct detection receiver","coupler","optical network unit","PBS","monolithic integration","polarization beam splitter","optical complexity","receiver sensitivity","frequency selectivity","coherent detection","access network","passive optical network architecture","long-reach WDM-PONs","polarization-insensitive single-balanced photodiode coherent receiver","bit rate 10.7 Gbit/s","frequency 25 GHz","loss 43.0 dB","loss 42.8 dB","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical access","coherent detection","polarization","Alamouti","polarization-time block code (PTBC)","wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)","passive optical network (PON)"]},{"kwd":["Alamouti","coherent detection","optical access","passive optical network (PON)","polarization","polarization-time block code (PTBC)","wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15, 15 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Polarization-Insensitive Single-Balanced Photodiode Coherent Receiver for Long-Reach WDM-PON<roman>s </roman>","accessionNumber":"15823613","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","publicationDate":"15 April15, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7352313/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU FP7 project ASTRON","grantNumber":"EPSRC EP/J008842/1 and UNLOC EP/J017582/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000275","fundingName":"RAEng/Leverhulme Trust"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization-Insensitive Single-Balanced Photodiode Coherent Receiver for Long-Reach WDM-PON<roman>s </roman>","sourcePdf":"jlt-erkilinc-2507869-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087319S","chronDate":"April15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7425114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7425114","articleId":"7352313","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7352315,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng Cheng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7365508/7352315/cheng-2503718-small.gif","p":["Zeng Cheng (S\u201913) was born in Hubei, China, in 1987.

When fabricated in deep-submicrometer (DSM) CMOS technology, TDCs have outstanding time stamping capability on the order of picoseconds. Typically, the timing resolution of a TDC directly determines the minimum resolvable spatial resolution in time-of-flight (ToF) measurements. It also limits the signal-to-noise ratio in ToF positron emission tomography and the in-band noise in an all-digital phase-locked-loop. In TDCs, good linearity and precision result in high measurement accuracy, while the detectable range is limited by its dynamic range. In addition, size and power consumption are of significant importance in large-scale array implementations such as image sensors. Here, we discuss the most recent developments in CMOS TDCs, with an emphasis on ring-oscillator-based TDC and its variants, due to their suitability for array designs with less area overhead. In addition, key performance metrics, and accurate cost-effective characterization methods will be discussed. Finally, future perspectives of CMOS TDCs will be highlighted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"63","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15683387","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7352315/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Recent Developments and Design Challenges of High-Performance Ring Oscillator CMOS Time-to-Digital Converters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FedDev Ontario"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000196","fundingName":"Canada Foundation for Innovation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008676","fundingName":"CMC Microsystems"},{"fundingName":"Networks of Centres of Excellence IC-IMPACTS"},{"fundingName":"NSERC ResEau SN"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent Developments and Design Challenges of High-Performance Ring Oscillator CMOS Time-to-Digital Converters","sourcePdf":"ted-deen-2503718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203879S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7365508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7365508","articleId":"7352315","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7352318,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey N.

The use of TMS might cause whole-body exposure to undesired induced currents in patients and TMS operators. The aim of this study is to test and justify a simple analytical model known previously, which may be helpful as an upper estimate of eddy current density at a particular distant observation point for any body composition and any coil setup. Methods: We compare the analytical solution with comprehensive adaptive mesh refinement-based FEM simulations of a detailed full-body human model, two coil types, five coil positions, about 100 000 observation points, and two distinct pulse rise times; thus, providing a representative number of different datasets for comparison, while also using other numerical data. Results: Our simulations reveal that, after a certain modification, the analytical model provides an upper estimate for the eddy current density at any location within the body. In particular, it overestimates the peak eddy currents at distant locations from a TMS coil by a factor of 10 on average. Conclusion: The simple analytical model tested in this study may be valuable as a rapid method to safely estimate levels of TMS currents at different locations within a human body. Significance: At present, safe limits of general exposure to TMS electric and magnetic fields are an open subject, including fetal exposure for pregnant women.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2507572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7547340/07352318.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2507572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7547340","startPage":"1944","endPage":"1955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary Upper Estimate of Peak Currents in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation at Distant Locations From a TMS Coil","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352318","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/7547340/7352318-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary Upper Estimate of Peak Currents in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation at Distant Locations From a TMS Coil","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16249019","pubMedId":"26685221","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7352318/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1520168"},{"fundingName":"National Institiutes of Health/National Library of Medicine","grantNumber":"R43 LM012352-01A1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Preliminary Upper Estimate of Peak Currents in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation at Distant Locations From a TMS Coil","sourcePdf":"tbme-makarov-2507572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086369S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7547340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7547340","articleId":"7352318","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7352320,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Goeckel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Goeckel","id":"37271275100"},{"name":"Boulat Bash","affiliation":["Quantum Information Processing group, Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Boulat","lastName":"Bash","id":"37304272100"},{"name":"Saikat Guha","affiliation":["Quantum Information Processing group, Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Saikat","lastName":"Guha","id":"37270989600"},{"name":"Don Towsley","affiliation":["College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Towsley","id":"37272331500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7352320","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":849},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Reliability","Channel estimation","Channel models","Uncertainty","Detectors","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","Gaussian channels","receivers","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covert communications","background noise power","receiver noise","AWGN channel","noise statistics","channel statistics","covert transmission"]},{"kwd":["Digital communication","signal detection","security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7399440/07352320.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2507594","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2507594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7399440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covert Communications When the Warden Does Not Know the Background Noise Power","abstract":"If the warden Willie attempting to detect the transmission knows the statistics of his receiver noise, Alice can transmit no more than O(\u221an) covert bits reliably to Bob in n channel uses of an AWGN channel.

For example, visual attributes have shown promising potentials in visual recognition and retrieval. However, the scarcity of labeled samples in the earth observation (EO) community (collection of labeled samples through photointerpretation or terrestrial campaigns is time consuming and expensive, and often requires expertise background) hinders the semantic understanding of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose to transfer the semantic knowledge learned from ground view scene images to overhead view very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. Specifically, a novel transfer sparse subspace analysis (TSSA) algorithm is presented for unsupervised cross-view scene modeladaptation. TSSA aims at finding a common embedding of the data across different views by simultaneously 1) minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), 2) preserving the main statistical property, and 3) maintaining the self-expressiveness property of the data in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Two variants of cross-view scene knowledge transfer have been investigated in our experiments. The first one is transfer of scene category models, and the second is transfer of scene attributes models. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our method with respect to state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2500961","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7542478/07352321.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2500961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2901","endPage":"2909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer Sparse Subspace Analysis for Unsupervised Cross-View Scene Model Adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Transfer Sparse Subspace Analysis for Unsupervised Cross-View Scene Model Adaptation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352321/","volume":"9","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7352321/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16212997","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61303186"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs\u2019 Foundation of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20124307120013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer Sparse Subspace Analysis for Unsupervised Cross-View Scene Model Adaptation","sourcePdf":"jstars-sun-2500961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083945S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7542478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7542478","articleId":"7352321","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7352332,"authors":[{"name":"Pratana Kukieattikool","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathumthanee, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pratana","lastName":"Kukieattikool","id":"37085779704"},{"name":"Norbert Goertz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications E389, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Goertz","id":"37295153600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7352332","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":507},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352332","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error probability","Complexity theory","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Bismuth","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","block codes","channel coding","decoding","error statistics","forward error correction","interleaved codes","Reed-Solomon codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst-error channel","high-rate wireless transmission","high performance forward-error-correction code","Reed-Solomon component code","baseline staircase code","binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hochquenghem component code","binary BCH component code","block interleaving","combat burst error","bit error probability","software complexity","decoding latency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["staircase codes","high rate wireless transmission","burst errors channel"]},{"kwd":["Staircase codes","high rate wireless transmission","burst errors channel"]}],"abstract":"We consider staircase codes, a class of high performance forward-error-correction codes for high-rate transmission, on channels with burst errors.

In the proposed scheme, all users encode their messages using a polar encoder, while a multiuser successive cancellation decoder is deployed at the receiver. The encoding is done separately across the users and is independent of the target achievable rate. For the code construction, the positions of information bits and frozen bits for each of the users are decided jointly. This is done by treating the polar transformations across all the m users as a single polar transformation with a certain polarization base. We characterize the resolution of achievable rates on the dominant face of the uniform rate region in terms of the number of users m and the length of the polarization base L. In particular, we prove that for any target rate on the dominant face, there exists an achievable rate, also on the dominant face, within the distance at most (m-1)\u221am/L from the target rate.

We first derive new closed-form expressions for the ergodic achievable rate for BF and IC precoding strategies with quantized channel state information (CSI), as well as, perfect CSI. Then, novel lower and upper bounds are derived which apply for an arbitrary number of antennas and are shown to be sufficiently tight to the Monte-Carlo results. Based on these results, we examine in detail three important special cases including: high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), weak interference between cellular link and D2D link, and BS equipped with a large number of antennas. We also derive asymptotic expressions for the ergodic achievable rate for these scenarios. Based on these results, we obtain valuable insights into the impact of the system parameters, such as the number of antennas, SNR and the interference for each link. In particular, we show that an irreducible saturation point exists in the high SNR regime, while the ergodic rate under IC strategy is verified to be always better than that under BF strategy. We also reveal that the ergodic achievable rate under perfect CSI scales as log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nM, whilst it reaches a ceiling with quantized CSI.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2507574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","startPage":"832","endPage":"846","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07352340.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming and Interference Cancellation for D2D Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7352340/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and Interference Cancellation for D2D Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786052","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471114, 61531011, 61222102 and 61171093"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFT10300"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communications Conference"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and Interference Cancellation for D2D Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jin-2507574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136496S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7352340","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7352344,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7823058/7352344/zhang-2503749-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (M\u201903\u2013SM\u201904\u2013F\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He joined the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992.

First, we derive an exact expression for the outage probability of the secondary transmissions, and then we propose an approximate expression whose validity limits are later evaluated. To improve the power efficiency of the secondary network, two power allocation schemes are proposed. In the first scheme, the transmit power is adjusted as a function of the average channel gains and the power control is formulated as a convex optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to outage probability constraints. In the second scheme, the transmit power is adjusted as a function of the instantaneous channel gains to guarantee a target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the receiver. We evaluate the performance of both schemes under cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios considering different network geometries. Our results indicate that the benefits of network coding cooperation are substantial for both power allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2507550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7410177/07352348.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2507550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Power Allocation Schemes for a Two-User Network-Coded Cooperative Cognitive Radio Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Power Allocation Schemes for a Two-User Network-Coded Cooperative Cognitive Radio Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352348/","volume":"64","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7352348/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15787073","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Power Allocation Schemes for a Two-User Network-Coded Cooperative Cognitive Radio Network","sourcePdf":"tsp-rebelatto-2507550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112684S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7410177","articleId":"7352348","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7352351,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Marc Roschatt","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7475920/7352351/rosch-2507860-small.gif","p":["Philipp Marc Roschatt (S\u201915) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng.\n degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K., in 2011.

This paper presents a converter using a gate drive with a negative biased gate voltage on the low-side FET to improve the dV/dt robustness. The resulting much larger voltage drop during the dead time conduction is a concern as it can quickly overcharge the bootstrap capacitor voltage. This paper demonstrates that with a negative biased gate voltage, the rise in the bootstrap capacitor voltage is predominantly caused by the change in effective dead time conduction due to a variation in output load. A spice model to estimate the change is presented and verified. This paper also found that a change in the bootstrap capacitor voltage must be prevented as it leads to a significant change in turn-on dynamics, resulting in higher dV/dt stress with an increase in output load. To prevent a change in bootstrap capacitor voltage, different techniques such as Zener diode clamping and an external free-wheeling Schottky diode are tested and discussed. Finally, a modification of a standard bootstrap circuit using a series inductor is proposed and tested. It has been found to be the most effective method in preventing a variation in the bootstrap capacitor voltage and should be included when using a negative gate drive in a GaN dc-dc buck converter.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2507860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7475920/07352351.pdf","startPage":"7161","endPage":"7170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2507860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bootstrap Voltage and Dead Time Behavior in GaN DC\u2013DC Buck Converter With a Negative Gate Voltage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bootstrap Voltage and Dead Time Behavior in GaN DC\u2013DC Buck Converter With a Negative Gate Voltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","volume":"31","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352351/","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16003751","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bootstrap Voltage and Dead Time Behavior in GaN DC\u2013DC Buck Converter With a Negative Gate Voltage","sourcePdf":"tpel-roschatt-2507860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076374S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7475920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7475920","articleId":"7352351","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7352352,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio G.

The underlying assumption is that such signals admit a sparse representation in a frequency domain related to the structure of the graph, which is captured by the so-called graph-shift operator. Instead of using the value of the signal observed at a subset of nodes to recover the signal in the entire graph, the sampling scheme proposed here uses as input observations taken at a single node. The observations correspond to sequential applications of the graph-shift operator, which are linear combinations of the information gathered by the neighbors of the node. When the graph corresponds to a directed cycle (which is the support of time-varying signals), our method is equivalent to the classical sampling in the time domain. When the graph is more general, we show that the Vandermonde structure of the sampling matrix, critical when sampling time-varying signals, is preserved. Sampling and interpolation are analyzed first in the absence of noise, and then noise is considered. We then study the recovery of the sampled signal when the specific set of frequencies that is active is not known. Moreover, we present a more general sampling scheme, under which, either our aggregation approach or the alternative approach of sampling a graph signal by observing the value of the signal at a subset of nodes can be both viewed as particular cases. Numerical experiments illustrating the results in both synthetic and real-world graphs close the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7410177/07352352.pdf","startPage":"1832","endPage":"1843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2507546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2507546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling of Graph Signals With Successive Local Aggregations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Time-domain analysis","Sampling methods","Sparse matrices","Matrix decomposition","Frequency-domain analysis","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","graph theory","interference (signal)","interpolation","matrix algebra","signal representation","signal sampling","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph signal sampling","successive local aggregation","sparse representation","frequency domain","graph-shift operator","sampling scheme","time-varying signal","time domain","Vandermonde structure","sampling matrix","interpolation","signal noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error covariance","graph signal processing","graph signals","interpolation","sampling","support selection"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7410177/7352352-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sampling of Graph Signals With Successive Local Aggregations","volume":"64","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7352352/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15799030","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Sampling of Graph Signals With Successive Local Aggregations","sourcePdf":"tsp-marques-2507546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09598S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"7410177","articleId":"7352352","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7352353,"authors":[{"name":"Wynand Louis Malan","affiliation":["Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7475920/7352353/malan-2507787-small.gif","p":["Wynand Louis Malan (S\u201912) received the B.E.

The proposed model is useful for fast simulation and for the estimation of state variables under large signal variation. The model is also useful for control design because the slow changing dynamics of the dq variables are relatively easy to control. Using the proposed model, a decoupled control scheme was designed which allows for the control of the high frequency link currents while also improving the soft switching range of the converter. Using steady-state relationships between state variables and the system inputs, the controller was simplified from three proportional integral (PI) controllers to a single PI controller. The controller was implemented on a low cost digital signal processor and verified experimentally. The experimental and simulation results showed the proposed model's usefulness for control design and fast simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2507787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7475920/07352353.pdf","startPage":"7297","endPage":"7310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2507787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Control of a Resonant Dual Active Bridge With a Tuned CLLC Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of a Resonant Dual Active Bridge With a Tuned CLLC Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352353/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16003773","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352353/","volume":"31","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001793","fundingName":"Queensland University of Technology APA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of a Resonant Dual Active Bridge With a Tuned CLLC Network","sourcePdf":"tpel-malan-2507787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119625S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7475920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7475920","articleId":"7352353","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7352359,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Campania, IT"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio"},{"name":"Danilo Orlando","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi \u201cNiccol\u00f2 Cusano\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Orlando"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"7352359","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":521},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Detectors","Radar detection","Clutter","Jamming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar","covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","radar clutter","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar detection","subspace signal","subspace structure","Gaussian interference","covariance matrix","clutter","thermal noise","radar antenna","principle of invariance","hypothesis testing problem invariant","optimum invariant detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive radar detection","coherent interference","constant false alarm rate","invariance","maximal invariants","subspace model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352359","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2507544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","abstract":"This paper deals with adaptive radar detection of a subspace signal competing with two sources of interference. The former is Gaussian with unknown covariance matrix and accounts for the joint presence of clutter plus thermal noise. The latter is structured as a subspace signal and models coherent pulsed jammers impinging on the radar antenna. The problem is solved via the Principle of Invariance which is based on the identification of a suitable group of transformations leaving the considered hypothesis testing problem invariant. A maximal invariant statistic, which completely characterizes the class of invariant decision rules and significantly compresses the original data domain, as well as its statistical characterization are determined. Thus, the existence of the optimum invariant detector is addressed together with the design of practically implementable invariant decision rules. At the analysis stage, the performance of some receivers belonging to the new invariant class is established through the use of analytic expressions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2507544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422173","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7422173/07352359.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Radar Detection of a Subspace Signal Embedded in Subspace Structured Plus Gaussian Interference Via Invariance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Radar Detection of a Subspace Signal Embedded in Subspace Structured Plus Gaussian Interference Via Invariance","publicationDate":"April15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15835645","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Radar Detection of a Subspace Signal Embedded in Subspace Structured Plus Gaussian Interference Via Invariance","sourcePdf":"tsp-demaio-2507544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058382S","chronDate":"April15,  2016","isNumber":"7422173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","articleId":"7352359","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7352360,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada","School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7410177/7352360/7352360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xue Jiang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the M.S. degree in acoustics and signal processing from Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from McMaster University, Canada, in 2007 and 2014, respectively.","From 2007 to 2010, she was a research engineer with Sunplus Inc., Beijing, China, where she was engaged in algorithmic research and development of mobile communication systems.

In this paper, we propose a nonconvex linear regression (NLR) based minimum dispersion beamforming technique for impulsive signals to achieve significant performance improvement over the conventional minimum variance beamformer. The proposed beamformer minimizes the lp-norm of the output with subject to a linear distortionless response constraint, resulting in a difficult nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem. The constrained optimization problem is first reduced to a multivariate linear regression via constraint elimination. As a major contribution of this paper, a coordinate descent algorithm (CDA) is devised for solving the resultant NLR problem of lp-minimization with at a computational complexity of O(MN\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), where M is the number of sensors and N is the sample size. At each inner iteration of the CDA, an efficient algorithm is designed to find the global minimum of each subproblem of univariate linear regression. The convergence of the CDA is analyzed. The NLR beamformer with a single constraint is further generalized to the case of multiple linear constraints, which is robust against model mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of nonconvex optimization based beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","volume":"64","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"15787066","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352360/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming via Nonconvex Linear Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming via Nonconvex Linear Regression","sourcePdf":"tsp-jiang-2507543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107307S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7410177","articleId":"7352360","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7352361,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Gholami","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7953698/7352361/ghola-2503320-small.gif","p":["Amin Gholami (S\u201914) received the B.Sc.

In recent years, several major incidents all around the world have highlighted the need for operative solutions in order to materialize the resilience of the power grid in response to such catastrophic events. With the advent of synchrophasor technology in modern power systems, it has emerged as a promising measure to improve the resilience of power network. At the event of widespread outages, synchrophasor technology could facilitate the restoration procedure, reduce total outage duration, and mitigate damaging impacts to critical loads. This paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical approach to the transmission-level load restoration problem based on synchrophasors. The first stage determines the optimal amount and location of load pickups, and in the second stage, the predetermined decisions are implemented and the network stability is monitored until reaching a viable equilibrium point. The whole problem is decomposed into a set of tractable subproblems in order to improve the computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is further illustrated through a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2503320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7953698/07352361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2503320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7953698","startPage":"1700","endPage":"1709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Response-Based Approach to the Load Restoration Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Response-Based Approach to the Load Restoration Problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969856","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7352361/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Response-Based Approach to the Load Restoration Problem","sourcePdf":"tsg-aminifar-2503320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068989S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7953698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7953698","articleId":"7352361","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7352371,"authors":[{"name":"Harri Pennanen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7410177/7352371/7352371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harri Pennanen (M\u201916) received his M.Sc.(Tech.) and Dr.Sc.(Tech.) degrees in telecommunications from the Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland, in 2007 and 2015, respectively.

This non-convex problem is divided into transmit and receive beamforming optimization steps which are iteratively repeated such that the sum power converges. The transmit beamformers are solved using a successive convex approximation method (SCA), whereas the receive beamformers are computed via the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. In addition to centralized design, we propose two decentralized algorithms where the transmit and receive beamforming designs are facilitated by a combination of pilot and backhaul signaling. In the first algorithm, sum power is minimized by computing the transmit beamformers at each base station (BS) and the receive beamformers at each user via iterative over-the-air optimization process. BS side processing requires local effective channel state information (CSI) acquired from precoded uplink pilots. In the second algorithm, the transmit and receive beamformers are iteratively optimized at each BS requiring only local CSI obtained from antenna-specific uplink pilots. In both algorithms, transmit beamforming optimization is decoupled among the BSs via primal decomposition method, which requires scalar backhaul information exchange for decentralized processing. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via numerical examples under different system settings in static and time-correlated channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2507539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7410177/07352371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2507539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410177","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Linear Transceiver Design and Signaling Strategies for Sum Power Minimization in Multi-Cell MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Linear Transceiver Design and Signaling Strategies for Sum Power Minimization in Multi-Cell MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15787068","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7352371/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Linear Transceiver Design and Signaling Strategies for Sum Power Minimization in Multi-Cell MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-pennanen-2507539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154507S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7410177","articleId":"7352371","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7352373,"authors":[{"name":"Yongheng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7475920/7352373/yang-2507545-small.gif","p":["Yongheng Yang (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Eng.\n degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University,\n Aalborg, Denmark, in 2014.","He was a Postgraduate with Southeast University, Nanjing, China, from 2009 to 2011.

The synchronization is actually to detect the instantaneous grid information (e.g., frequency and phase of the grid voltage) for the current control, which is commonly performed by a phase-locked loop (PLL) system. Hence, harmonics and deviations in the estimated frequency by the PLL could lead to current tracking performance degradation, especially for the periodic signal controllers (e.g., PR and RC) with a fixed sampling rate. In this paper, the impacts of frequency deviations induced by the PLL and/or the grid disturbances on the selected current controllers are investigated by analyzing the frequency adaptability of these current controllers. Subsequently, strategies to enhance the frequency adaptability of the current controllers are proposed for the power converters to produce high-quality feed-in currents even in the presence of grid frequency deviations. Specifically, by feeding back the PLL estimated frequency to update the center frequencies of the resonant controllers and by approximating the fractional delay using a Lagrange interpolating polynomial for the RC, respectively, the frequency-variation-immunity of these periodic current controllers with a fixed sampling rate is improved. Experiments on a single-phase grid-connected system are presented, which have verified the discussions and the effectiveness of the frequency adaptive current controllers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2507545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7475920/07352373.pdf","startPage":"7273","endPage":"7285","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2507545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the Frequency Adaptability of Periodic Current Controllers With a Fixed Sampling Rate for Grid-Connected Power Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Frequency Adaptability of Periodic Current Controllers With a Fixed Sampling Rate for Grid-Connected Power Converters","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7352373/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16003794","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Frequency Adaptability of Periodic Current Controllers With a Fixed Sampling Rate for Grid-Connected Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2507545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114957S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7475920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7475920","articleId":"7352373","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7352376,"authors":[{"name":"Yazhou Jiang","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yazhou Jiang (S'12) received the B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2011.

An adjustable robust restoration optimization model with a two-stage objective is proposed in this paper, involving the uncertain DG outputs and load demands. The first stage generates optimal strategies for recovery of outage power and the second stage seeks the worst-case fluctuation scenarios. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using the column-and-constraint generation method. The feasibility and reliability of the strategies obtained via this robust optimization model can be guaranteed for all cases in the predefined uncertainty sets with good performance. A technique known as the uncertainty budget is used to adjust the conservativeness of this model, providing a tradeoff between conservativeness and robustness. Numerical tests are carried out on the modified PG&E 69-bus system and a modified 246-bus system to compare the robust optimization model against a deterministic restoration model, which verifies the superiority of this proposed model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Restoration Method for Active Distribution Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2503426","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7546948/07352378.pdf","startPage":"4005","endPage":"4015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2503426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7546948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust Restoration Method for Active Distribution Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7352378/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16230387","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Restoration Method for Active Distribution Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wu-2503426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083175S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7546948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"7546948","articleId":"7352378","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7352379,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Oregon State University, School of EECS, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/7358471/7352379/7352379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Hung Chen received the B.S. degree in nuclear engineering from National Tsing Hua University, HsinChu, Taiwan, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA, in 2013.

In many applications, the best choice is to use incremental A/D converters (IADCs) incorporating extended counting. In this paper, we discuss the operation and design of IADCs, including single-loop and MASH architectures. When using a direct-feed-forward modulator, the IADC accumulates the residue voltage, and it is easily to implement a hybrid scheme of extended counting. Several hybrid schemes are review and discussed. A multi-step extended counting scheme is discussed for high-resolution power-efficient conversion. Optimal trade-off between high order and high oversampling ratio is critical for energy efficiency. A two-step IADC is discussed, which extends the performance of an Nth-order IADC close to that of a (2N-1)th-order IADC, with reduced power. An implemented device uses the circuitry of a second-order IADC (IADC2) to achieve a performance close to that of a third-order IADC. The two-step operation can be extended to multi-step one, and the SQNR performance can be increased significantly. The two-step operation can be extended to multi-step operation, which can boost up the order of SQNR and further improve the energy efficiency drastically.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-stage noise shaping","Time-domain analysis","Quantization (signal)","Analog-digital conversion","Delta-sigma modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","energy conservation","feedforward","iterative methods","modulators","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental analog-to-digital converter","high-resolution energy-efficient sensor interface","integrated sensor interface circuit","data converter","IADC","MASH architecture","direct-feed-forward modulator","multistep extended counting scheme","oversampling ratio","energy efficiency","SQNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","decimation filter","delta sigma $(\\Delta\\Sigma)$ ","extended-counting","incremental data converters","low power","measurement and instrumentation","multi-stage noise shaping (MASH)","multi-step","sensor interface","time-domain analysis","two step"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2502135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7358471/07352379.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2502135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Analog-to-Digital Converters for High-Resolution Energy-Efficient Sensor Interfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Analog-to-Digital Converters for High-Resolution Energy-Efficient Sensor Interfaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352379/","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352379/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15683531","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Analog-to-Digital Converters for High-Resolution Energy-Efficient Sensor Interfaces","sourcePdf":"jetcas-chen-2502135-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1118S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7358471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7358471","articleId":"7352379","onlineDate":"10 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7352460,"authors":[{"name":"Antonius P.

This sub-module consists of two main components, namely FPGA and three-phase inverter, which consists of opto-isolation circuit, logic inverter, MOSFET driver, and three-phase full-bridge inverter circuit. The FPGA unit generates digital SPWM signal as input to the inverter to convert DC voltage into three-phase AC voltage according to the given input frequency. Results show that the sub-module can control the speed in the range of 14000-28000 RPM with the corresponding frequency range of 250-500 Hz. The Sub-module also has constant V/F and Speed/Frequency (\u03c9/F) characteristics. In addition, a ramp speed profile used during acceleration and deceleration has also been successfully implemented to address the problem of low starting torque due to the increase of supply frequency.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352462","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337353/7352453/07352462.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of an FPGA-based sub-module as three-phase spindle motor speed controller for CNC PCB milling machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Development of an FPGA-based sub-module as three-phase spindle motor speed controller for CNC PCB milling machine","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352462/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663999","conferenceDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an FPGA-based sub-module as three-phase spindle motor speed controller for CNC PCB milling machine","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ICEEI2015003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106303S","chronDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337353","isNumber":"7352453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7352453","articleId":"7352462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7352483,"authors":[{"name":"Zulfikar","affiliation":["Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Aceh, ID"],"lastName":"Zulfikar"},{"name":"Hubbul Walidainy","affiliation":["Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Aceh, ID"],"firstName":"Hubbul","lastName":"Walidainy"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7319-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6778-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6777-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6779-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"}],"articleNumber":"7352483","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Multiplexing","Buffer storage","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","discrete Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","matrix algebra","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms circuit","DFT algorithm","Rademacher functions","Walsh transforms","Walsh matrices","DFT matrix","negative circuit","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFT","Walsh transforms","Rademacher functions","DFT matrix","Walsh matrix"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new circuit design for implementing 4-point DFT algorithm based on product of Rademacher functions. The circuit has been derived from the similarity of how Fourier transforms and Walsh transforms are implemented. Walsh matrices contain numbers either +1 or -1 except for first row.

This similarity has been taken into the case of how to implement the DFT circuit based on how Walsh transforms is generated. Since Walsh transforms is derived based on product of Rademacher functions, the proposed 4-point DFT circuit is designed according to product Rademacher functions.

The computation is carried out by discretizing a model of circular waveguide resonator which has the radius of 10.12mm and the length of 60mm using FDTD notation and numerically computed to determine its resonant frequency in transverse electric (TE) mode. Some scenarios are applied for loading the waveguide by dielectric materials to analyze its resonant frequency to be compared with the hollow circular waveguide. From the results, it is shown that the TE mode resonant frequency for loaded circular waveguide is lower than of hollow circular waveguide which satisfies the numerical prediction. Meanwhile, from the scenario of circular waveguide partially loaded with dielectric material which is coated from outer region in a certain depth, it is found that the resonant frequency varies depending on the depth of dielectric material or on the volume proportion of dielectric material in the waveguide. The result shows when the proportion of dielectric material is 36% the lower resonant frequency is similar with the waveguide fully loaded with dielectric material.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352517","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337353/7352453/07352517.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant frequency computation of dielectric material loaded circular waveguide using cylindrical coordinate system-based FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352517/","displayDocTitle":"Resonant frequency computation of dielectric material loaded circular waveguide using cylindrical coordinate system-based FDTD method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663969","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352517/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant frequency computation of dielectric material loaded circular waveguide using cylindrical coordinate system-based FDTD method","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ICEEI2015058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048253S","chronDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337353","isNumber":"7352453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7352453","articleId":"7352517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7352567,"authors":[{"name":"Retno First Tyastuti","affiliation":["PT.

Femtocells are proven in enhancing the quality of service of indoor users. Generally, femtocells are installed without being planned by users, and cannot be controlled directly by operator. It causes major problem such as cross-tier interference. Handover process solves this interference problem by changing serving node for users around femtocells. Location of femtocells are generally adjacent to each other. Hence, the selection of an appropriate handover target becomes very important. In this paper, we analyzed new algorithm by considering RSRP and femtocell closest distance to determine the handover target. The algorithm makes the handover target chosen appropriately. Simulation results show that the use of our proposed algorithm produces CDF of SINR better than considering RSRP only.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352580","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337353/7352453/07352580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352453","startPage":"656","endPage":"660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink cross-tier interference mitigation for macrocell user in open access femtocell using handover scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink cross-tier interference mitigation for macrocell user in open access femtocell using handover scenario","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352580/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663972","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7352580/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink cross-tier interference mitigation for macrocell user in open access femtocell using handover scenario","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ICEEI2015121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067373S","chronDate":"10-11 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337353","isNumber":"7352453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7352453","articleId":"7352580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7352583,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Khatim Hasan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science & Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Khatim","lastName":"Hasan","id":"38182869400"},{"name":"Samsul Arifin Abdul Karim","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Seri Iskandar, Perak, MY"],"firstName":"Samsul Arifin Abdul","lastName":"Karim","id":"38229433000"},{"name":"Jumat Sulaiman","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jumat","lastName":"Sulaiman","id":"37542504000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7319-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6778-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6777-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6779-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"}],"articleNumber":"7352583","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352583","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predator prey systems","Approximation methods","Turning","Computational modeling","Market research","Analytical models","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","predator-prey systems","Runge-Kutta methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphical analysis","Rosenzweig-MacArthur model","Adams-Moultan method","fourth-order Runge-Kutta method","performance analysis","mesh sizes","birth rate","death rate","prey-predator system","logical behaviour","computation time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rosenzweig-McArthur","Adam-Moultan","fourth order Runge-Kutta"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352583","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337353/7352453/07352583.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","startPage":"670","endPage":"675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphical analysis of Rosenzweig-MacArthur model via adams-moultan and fourth order Runge-Kutta methods","abstract":"This paper analysed the Rosenweig-MacArthur model.

Generic technologies are widely recognized to be beneficial for various market applications ([Bresnahan, Trajtenberg, 1995]; [Maine, Garsney, 2006]) and recent research results show that double unknown can lead companies to organize design activity to develop generic technologies suitable for several emerging markets application [Kokshagina, et al. 2012a]. However, the investigations so far focused on the level of the individual firm, while a \u201cdouble unknown\u201d situation is typically characterizing an industrial sector as a whole. This is in particular the case of the semiconductor industry: While the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) primary focus has been and still is the continuation of Moore's law, it introduced recently the \u201cMore than Moore\u201d concept, to account for technologies which do not necessarily follow the CMOS miniaturization trends, and represent a growing part of the total silicon-based semiconductor market. The sheer diversity of both those technologies and their potential applications renders a roadmapping exercise very challenging. Nevertheless, given the benefits that roadmapping has brought to the semiconductor industry, the International Roadmap Committee (IRC) of the ITRS has decided to extend its activities to this new field. Which strategies do the ITRS experts implement to select which technologies to roadmap and which applications to target in double unknown? In this paper, we show that to design roadmaps for More than Moore technologies, the ITRS experts apply a strategy of \u201ccommon unknown\u201d [Kokshagina, et al. 2012a], along with additional community building activities specific to the situation of inter-firm collaboration.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Industry-wide technology roadmapping in double unknown \u2014 The case of the semiconductor industry","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE) & IEEE International Technology Management Conference","doi":"10.1109/ITMC.2013.7352611","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE) & IEEE International Technology Management Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7340393/7352596/07352611.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITMC.2013.7352611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Industry-wide technology roadmapping in double unknown \u2014 The case of the semiconductor industry","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352611/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"15665659","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Industry-wide technology roadmapping in double unknown \u2014 The case of the semiconductor industry","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"Cogez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065945S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"7340393","isNumber":"7352596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7340393","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7352596","articleId":"7352611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7352873,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Choudhury","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Energy Research (PEER) Group, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Choudhury","id":"38541994600"},{"name":"Pragasen Pillay","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Energy Research (PEER) Group, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Pragasen","lastName":"Pillay","id":"37272823000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7637-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7636-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7352873","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Inverters","Medium voltage","Switches","Reactive power","Voltage control","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet machines","synchronous machines","traction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior PMSM","load torque","capacitor voltage difference","switching cycle","redundant voltage vectors","virtual space vector","DC-link capacitor voltage fluctuation","phase voltage","phase current","neutral point potential fluctuation","interior permanent magnet synchronous machine","field weakening region","three-level neutral point clamped traction inverter drive","DC-link voltage balancing algorithm","power 6 kW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352873","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2015.7352873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2015.7352873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352853","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352212/7352853/07352873.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DC-Link Voltage Balancing Algorithm for Three-Level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) Traction Inverter Drive in Field Weakening Region","abstract":"A DC-link voltage balancing algorithm for a three- level neutral point clamped (NPC) traction inverter drive with interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) is proposed.

The simulation results will show the improvements made by this control method compared to the conventional PI controller, in terms of improving the power management, reducing stress on the sources and increasing robustness due to reference changes.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2015.7352983","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352212/7352853/07352983.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2015.7352983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Controller to Manage the Power Flow of a Hybrid Source for Electric Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Supercapacitors","Neural networks","Vehicles","Bridge circuits","Wheels","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","electric vehicles","load flow control","neurocontrollers","secondary cells","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network controller","power flow","electric vehicles","active hybrid energy source","battery","ultracapacitor","dual active bridge DC/DC converter","power distribution","bidirectional converter","transient response","driving cycle","PI controller","power management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7352983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Controller to Manage the Power Flow of a Hybrid Source for Electric Vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7352983/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668599","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Controller to Manage the Power Flow of a Hybrid Source for Electric Vehicles","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1168180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044889S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7352212","isNumber":"7352853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7352212","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7352853","articleId":"7352983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7353037,"authors":[{"name":"Joe Lemieux","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, Mi, USA"],"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"Lemieux","id":"37085702408"},{"name":"Yuan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, Mi, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085700365"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7637-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7636-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353037","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Standards","Machine learning","Neural networks","Roads","Data mining","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","fossil fuels","fuel cell vehicles","hybrid electric vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle speed prediction","deep learning","energy consumption","dual power source vehicles","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","plug in fuel cell electric vehicles","energy usage","fossil fuel energy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353037","abstract":"Global optimization of the energy consumption of dual power source vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and plug in fuel cell electric vehicles requires knowledge of the complete route characteristics at the beginning of the trip. One of the main characteristics is the vehicle speed profile across the route. The profile will translate directly into energy requirements for a given vehicle. However, the vehicle speed that a given driver chooses will vary from driver to driver and from time to time, and may be slower, equal to, or faster than the average traffic flow. If the specific driver speed profile can be predicted, the energy usage can be optimized across the route chosen. The purpose of this paper is to research the application of Deep Learning techniques to this problem to identify at the beginning of a drive cycle the driver specific vehicle speed profile for an individual driver repeated drive cycle, which can be used in an optimization algorithm to minimize the amount of fossil fuel energy used during the trip.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2015.7353037","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2015.7353037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352853","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352212/7352853/07353037.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353037/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353037/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15668596","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"pid1167714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043486S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7352212","isNumber":"7352853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7352212","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7352853","articleId":"7353037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7353091,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Al Haj Hassan","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement R\u00e9seaux, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 et Multim\u00e9dia, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7353091/alhaj-2507781-small.gif","p":["Hussein Al Haj Hassan received the Diploma degree in telecommunication and computer engineering and the master\u2019s degree in networks of telecommunications from Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.

As an energy provider, the power grid is evolving into a smarter one, which allows more energy-efficient cellular networks and enables cooperation and interaction with the smart grid. On one hand, cellular networks can use harvested renewable energy and on-site energy storage to reduce their energy costs. On the other hand, the price of electricity depends on the energy load, which will eventually contribute to decreasing the peak consumption and global energy cost. In this paper, we propose new integration architecture for renewable energy-powered cellular networks and the smart grid. The proposed architecture is designed based on the classification and the analysis of the existing proposals and the requirements of the smart grid, renewable energy systems, and cellular networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353091/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15656100","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Cellular Networks, Smart Grid, and Renewable Energy: Analysis, Architecture, and Challenges","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French Ministry of Industry through the Celtic Opera Net 2 European Project"},{"fundingName":"Research Projects Greenfeed (Fond Unique Interminist\u00e9riel) and Smart Energy Aware Systems (Information Technology for European Advancement)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Integrating Cellular Networks, Smart Grid, and Renewable Energy: Analysis, Architecture, and Challenges","sourcePdf":"access-alhajhassan-2507781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132543S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7353091","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7353103,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohuan Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7404293/7353103/wu-2508059-small.gif","p":["Xiaohuan Wu received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

In this paper, we first propose a perturbed SSR-based model to alleviate this limitation by incorporating a bias parameter into the DOA estimation framework. Using this model, a perturbed sparse Bayesian learning-based algorithm, named PSBL, is developed to solve the DOA estimation problem, followed by a theoretical analysis of PSBL. We then present two algorithms based on the covariance matrix of the array output, named perturbed covariance matrix (PCM) and improved PCM (IPCM), respectively, to improve the convergence speed of PSBL. Extensive experiments show that the PSBL enjoys a high estimation accuracy in the cases of limited snapshots, low signal-to-noise-ratio, correlated, and spatially adjacent signals. In particular, PCM not only keeps the merits of PSBL, but also exhibits superiority over PSBL in terms of computational efficiency. IPCM has a better computational efficiency, but with a small sacrifice of its performance in a correlated signal scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction of Arrival Estimation for Off-Grid Signals Based on Sparse Bayesian Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2508059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7404293/07353103.pdf","startPage":"2004","endPage":"2016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2508059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Direction of Arrival Estimation for Off-Grid Signals Based on Sparse Bayesian Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7353103/","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15785828","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications","grantNumber":"213012"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program for Post-Graduate in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYLX 0813"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20130874"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61302101, 61302103, 61372122 and 61471205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction of Arrival Estimation for Off-Grid Signals Based on Sparse Bayesian Learning","sourcePdf":"jsen-wu-2508059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109708S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7404293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7404293","articleId":"7353103","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353121,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

We derive a simple analytic expression for the iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding threshold of a randomly punctured LDPC code ensemble on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and show that, with respect to the BP threshold, the strength and suitability of an LDPC code ensemble for random puncturing is completely determined by a single constant that depends only on the rate and the BP threshold of the mother code ensemble. We then provide an efficient way to accurately predict BP thresholds of randomly punctured LDPC code ensembles on the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BI-AWGNC), given only the BP threshold of the mother code ensemble on the BEC and the design rate, and we show how the prediction can be improved with knowledge of the BI-AWGNC threshold. We also perform an asymptotic minimum distance analysis of randomly punctured code ensembles and present simulation results that confirm the robust decoding performance promised by the asymptotic results. Protograph-based LDPC block code and spatially coupled LDPC code ensembles are used throughout as examples to demonstrate the results.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2507758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7384402/07353121.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2507758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomly Punctured LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Randomly Punctured LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353121/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15704966","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353121/","volume":"34","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1161754"},{"fundingName":"TUBITAK","grantNumber":"111E276"},{"fundingName":"International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing"},{"fundingName":"IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomly Punctured LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"jsac-mitchell-2507758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120775S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7384402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7384402","articleId":"7353121","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7353122,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Yamazaki","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Hiroshi Yamazaki received the B.S. degree in integrated human studies\n and the M.S. degree in human and environmental studies from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2003 and 2005,\n respectively; the Dr. Eng. degree in electronics and applied physics from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo,\n Japan, in 2015.

Analog bandwidth of DACs is one of the major limiting factors for the system capacity. In this paper, we present an idea to extend the analog bandwidth of DACs by utilizing a digital preprocessor, two sub-DACs, and an analog multiplexer (AMUX). The AMUX is a high-speed linear selector, and a frequency-domain interpretation of the AMUX's function has led us to devise the digital preprocessing for a seamless extension of the analog bandwidth. This configuration, which we call a digital-preprocessed analog-multiplexed DAC, provides nearly doubled analog bandwidth compared to that of each subDAC with a symmetric configuration. The idea was verified by a transmission experiment with 160-Gb/s 80-Gbaud Nyquist four-level pulse amplitude modulation. In the experiment, we used subDACs with an analog bandwidth of ~20 GHz in combination with an AMUX fabricated with InP heterojunction bipolar transistor technology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital-Preprocessed Analog-Multiplexed DAC for Ultrawideband Multilevel Transmitter","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2508040","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7425125/07353122.pdf","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2508040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7425125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Digital-Preprocessed Analog-Multiplexed DAC for Ultrawideband Multilevel Transmitter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7353122/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","publicationDate":"1 April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15823669","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital-Preprocessed Analog-Multiplexed DAC for Ultrawideband Multilevel Transmitter","sourcePdf":"jlt-yamazaki-2508040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123125S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7425125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7425125","articleId":"7353122","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353131,"authors":[{"name":"Changfu Zou","affiliation":["NICTA Victoria, Australia","Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/7533519/7353131/zou-2502899-small.gif","p":["Changfu Zou (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree in automotive engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011.

This paper seeks to develop a framework for battery model simplification starting from an initial high-order physics-based model that will explicitly detail the assumptions underpinning the development of simplified battery models. Starting from the basis of a model capturing the electrochemical, thermal, electrical, and aging dynamics in a set of partial differential equations, a systematic approach based on singular perturbations and averaging is used to simplify the dynamics through identification of disparate timescales inherent in the problem. As a result, libraries of simplified models with interconnections based on the specified assumptions are obtained. A quantitative comparison of the simplified models relative to the original model is used to justify the model reductions. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, a set of battery charging strategies is evaluated at reduced computational effort on simplified models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Aging","Electrodes","Australia","Electric potential"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium compounds","partial differential equations","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PDE-based lithium-ion battery model","battery management","high-order physics-based model","aging dynamics","partial differential equation","singular perturbation","battery charging strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Averaging","battery models","charging strategy evaluation","lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery","model simplification","singular perturbation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353131","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2015.2502899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/7533519/07353131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2502899","startPage":"1594","endPage":"1609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7533519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Simplification of PDE-Based Lithium-Ion Battery Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Simplification of PDE-Based Lithium-Ion Battery Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353131/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7353131/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16208864","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Information and Communications Technology, Australia (NICTA)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FT100100538"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Simplification of PDE-Based Lithium-Ion Battery Models","sourcePdf":"tcst-zou-2502899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104295S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"7533519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7533519","articleId":"7353131","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7353133,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tao","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., Boulder, CO, USA","Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Signal Processing of Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tao","id":"37399182100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7353133","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353133","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Equalizers","MIMO","Complexity theory","Estimation","Indexes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","MIMO communication","modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity soft input soft output linear equalizer design","SISO LE design","turbo equalization","Cat-I","multiple input multiple output system","MIMO system","constant-modulus modulation","nonconstant-modulus modulation","high-order modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soft-input","soft-output linear equalizer","Turbo equalization"]},{"kwd":["Soft-input","soft-output linear equalizer","Turbo equalization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7448987","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2508032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Low-Complexity Soft-Input Soft-Output Linear Equalizers","startPage":"132","endPage":"135","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7448987/07353133.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2508032","abstract":"The design of low-complexity soft-input soft-output (SISO) linear equalizer (LE) for turbo equalization can be classified into two categories: the Cat-I assuming random a priori soft input (from the decoder) and the Cat-II treating the a priori input deterministic.

In this paper, by utilizing the cognitive radio (CR) technique, we study a new type of CR enabled secondary WPCN, called cognitive WPCN, under spectrum sharing with the primary wireless communication system. In particular, we consider a cognitive WPCN, consisting of one single H-AP with constant power supply and distributed wireless powered users, shares the same spectrum for its DL WET and UL WIT with an existing primary communication link, where the WPCN's WET/WIT and the primary link's WIT may interfere with each other. Under this new setup, we propose two coexisting models for spectrum sharing of the two systems, namely underlay and overlay-based cognitive WPCNs, depending on different types of knowledge on the primary user transmission available for the cognitive WPCN. For each model, we maximize the sum-throughput of the cognitive WPCN by optimizing its transmission under different constraints applied to protect the primary user transmission. Analysis and simulation results are provided to compare the sum-throughput of the cognitive WPCN versus the achievable rate of the primary user under two proposed coexisting models. It is shown that the overlay based cognitive WPCN outperforms the underlay based counterpart, thanks to its fully co-operative WET/WIT design with the primary WIT, while also requiring higher complexity for implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2015.2508028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7430376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2015.2508028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/7430376/07353134.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Wireless Powered Network: Spectrum Sharing Models and Throughput Maximization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Wireless Powered Network: Spectrum Sharing Models and Throughput Maximization","volume":"1","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353134/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15853264","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353134/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Wireless Powered Network: Spectrum Sharing Models and Throughput Maximization","sourcePdf":"tccn-lee-2508028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103338S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"7430376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7430376","articleId":"7353134","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7353137,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Ttofis","affiliation":["ACC Innovations Ltd, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7534965/7353137/ttofi-2506567-small.gif","p":["Christos Ttofis (S\u201909-M\u201914) received the BSc, MSc, and PhD\n degrees in computer engineering from the University of Cyprus in 2009, 2011, and 2014, respectively.

Such systems demand high processing performance and accurate depth perception, while their deployment in embedded and mobile environments implies that cost, energy and memory overheads need to be minimized. Hardware acceleration has been demonstrated in efficient embedded stereo vision systems. To this end, this paper presents the design and implementation of a hardware-based stereo matching system able to provide high accuracy and concurrently high performance for embedded vision devices, which are associated with limited hardware and power budget. We first implemented a compact and efficient design of the guided image filter, an edge-preserving filter, which reduces the hardware complexity of the implemented stereo algorithm, while at the same time maintains high-quality results. The guided filter design is used in two parts of the stereo matching pipeline, showing that it can simplify the hardware complexity of the Adaptive Support Weight aggregation step, and efficiently enable a powerful disparity refinement unit, which improves matching accuracy, even though cost aggregation is based on simple, fixed support strategies. We implemented several variants of our design on a Kintex-7 FPGA board, which was able to process HD video (1,280 \u00d7 720) in real-time (60 fps), using ~57.5k and ~71k of the FPGA's logic (CLB) and register resources, respectively. Additionally, the proposed stereo matching design delivers leading accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art hardware implementations based on the Middlebury evaluation metrics (at least 1.5 percent less bad matching pixels).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Cost Real-Time Embedded Stereo Vision System for Accurate Disparity Estimation Based on Guided Image Filtering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2506567","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7534965/07353137.pdf","startPage":"2678","endPage":"2693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2506567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Cost Real-Time Embedded Stereo Vision System for Accurate Disparity Estimation Based on Guided Image Filtering","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7353137/","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2016","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16207473","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Cost Real-Time Embedded Stereo Vision System for Accurate Disparity Estimation Based on Guided Image Filtering","sourcePdf":"tc-ttofis-2506567-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1227S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7534965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7534965","articleId":"7353137","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353138,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuteru Namba","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["\nKazuteru Namba (M'03), photograph and biography not available at the \ntime of publication."]},"firstName":"Kazuteru","lastName":"Namba","id":"37323293400"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["\nFabrizio Lombardi (F'09), photograph and biography not available at the \ntime of publication."]},"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-4388"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2574"}],"articleNumber":"7353138","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org"}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel construction scheme for nonbinary single-error correcting (SEC) codes that yields highspeed parallel decoding. The proposed scheme utilizes two methods, namely, Improved and Reordered; these methods can be also combined. Both of these methods reduce the number of 1's in the parity-check matrix (H-matrix) by reducing the 1's in every row vector. This results in a reduction in the gate depth in the syndrome generator, thus achieving a shorter delay time for parallel decoding. In the proposed Improved method, for a single b-bit byte (i.e., 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sup>\n-ary symbol) error correcting code, the submatrix of the H-matrix corresponding to every b-bit byte is multiplied with a regular matrix. The so-called improved submatrix is generated using a heuristic (greedy) algorithm. The proposed Reordered method selects the correct b-bit bytes for deletion when shortening is performed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme accomplishes a faster parallel decoding time than existing schemes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is applicable to any class of linear SEC codes, whereas existing schemes are applicable only to specific codes. Extensive simulation results are provided to substantiate the viability of the proposed codes for faster parallel decoding (albeit incurring for most cases in modest increases of area and power dissipation due to additional circuitry).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/7426441/07353138.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2015.2507983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2015.2507983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7426441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Parallel Decodable Nonbinary Single-Error Correcting (SEC) Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error correction codes","Generators","Logic gates","Bismuth","Phase change materials","Calculators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","greedy algorithms","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed parallel decodable codes","nonbinary single-error correcting codes","SEC codes","high speed parallel decoding","parity-check matrix","H-matrix","syndrome generator","delay time","regular matrix","improved submatrix","heuristic algorithm","greedy algorithm","reordered method","correct b-bit bytes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correcting code (ECC)","single error correction (SEC)","non-binary codes","parallel decoder"]},{"kwd":["Error correcting code (ECC)","single error correction (SEC)","non-binary codes","parallel decoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Parallel Decodable Nonbinary Single-Error Correcting (SEC) Codes","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7353138/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823878","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Parallel Decodable Nonbinary Single-Error Correcting (SEC) Codes","sourcePdf":"tdmr-lombardi-2507983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057684S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"7426441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7426441","articleId":"7353138","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353147,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyu Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6509490/8038288/7353147/zhao-2507547-small.gif","p":["Shiyu Zhao received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2014.","He is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, CA, USA.

Since the bearings are invariant to the translation and scale of the formation, the bearing-based approach provides a simple solution to the problem of translational and scaling formation maneuver control. Linear formation control laws for double-integrator dynamics are proposed and the global formation stability is analyzed.

Our evaluation shows that the proposed method can significantly outperform both the commonly used threshold-based decision, and the recently proposed optimization-based approach with a Markovian prior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353154/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15645698","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved Tampering Localization in Digital Image Forensics Based on Maximal Entropy Random Walk","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shenzhen RD Program","grantNumber":"GJHZ20140418191518323"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332012 and U1135001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Tampering Localization in Digital Image Forensics Based on Maximal Entropy Random Walk","sourcePdf":"lsp-korus-2507598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069686S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7314997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7314997","articleId":"7353154","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7353156,"authors":[{"name":"Songchuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, China","Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7353156/zhang-2490170-small.gif","p":["Songchuan Zhang was born in Fujian, China, in 1977.

This decoding scheme, however, suffers from very high complexity with long delay and large memory space. Motivated by this research problem, we propose a novel coding scheme called multi-CRC polar code for significant reduction of memory size and decoding delay but with negligible performance loss. Our analysis and simulation have shown that about half reduction of memory size and decoding delay can be achieved in SCL decoding. We also apply this scheme to hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) system to aid retransmission and show that the throughput of multi-CRC polar code is higher than that of the single-CRC one.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2508022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7399440/07353162.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2508022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7399440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-CRC Polar Codes and Their Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-CRC Polar Codes and Their Applications","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7353162/","accessionNumber":"15773504","volume":"20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001417","fundingName":"National Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2015ZX03002010"},{"fundingName":"National 863","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61571003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-CRC Polar Codes and Their Applications","sourcePdf":"lcomm-shi-2508022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088031S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7399440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7399440","articleId":"7353162","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7353165,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085613110"},{"name":"Huaqiang Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huaqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"38239733500"},{"name":"Bin Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37399191900"},{"name":"Lingjun Dai","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingjun","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085616461"},{"name":"Ning Deng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Deng","id":"37277730700"},{"name":"D.

In such systems, the sparsity of the beamspace channel matrix makes the channel rank reduction and limited feedback realizable. Based on these preferable features, this paper introduces two kinds of beamspace transformation and exploits their corresponding beamspace characters. Then, the spatial division multiple access (SDMA) and the interference suppression precoding are investigated separately. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of these two traditional schemes, the authors focus on the design of the limited-feedback-based multiuser transmission schemes for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems. An enhanced SDMA scheme is first proposed in this paper, which utilizes the beamspace sparsity and overcomes the challenges of channel information acquisition and interference control from a general perspective. Based on these, we analyze the interuser interference condition and further propose a joint transmission scheme, which incorporates a double-precoding-based SDMA and an interference suppression precoding. The performances of the proposed schemes are also evaluated via simulation, which show that high system sum-rate capacity could be achieved with only low computational complexity and a small amount of feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Transmission Schemes for Millimeter-Wave Massive MU-MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2481089","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7875385/07353166.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2481089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7875385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Transmission Schemes for Millimeter-Wave Massive MU-MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7353166/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16724827","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61531011, 61571112, 61450110445, 61325004 and 61222102"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012021"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFT10300"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001032-004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003181","fundingName":"A Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China (FANEDD)","grantNumber":"201446"},{"fundingName":"Excellent Young Teachers Program of Southeast University","grantNumber":"2242015R30006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501127"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61422201 and 61370159"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway","grantNumber":"240079/F20"},{"fundingName":"European Commission FP7 Project CROWN","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-627490"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Transmission Schemes for Millimeter-Wave Massive MU-MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-han-2481089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108624S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7875385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7875385","articleId":"7353166","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353170,"authors":[{"name":"Yanrong Guo","affiliation":["Department of Radiology and BRIC, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yanrong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37897158600"},{"name":"Yaozong Gao","affiliation":["Department of Radiology and BRIC, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Yaozong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37071701400"},{"name":"Dinggang Shen","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea","Department of Radiology and BRIC, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Dinggang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279369100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"7353170","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":3209},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"abstract":"Automatic and reliable segmentation of the prostate is an important but difficult task for various clinical applications such as prostate cancer radiotherapy. The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7445273/07353170.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2508280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2508280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7445273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Shape","Machine learning","Deformable models","Feature extraction","Cancer","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biomedical MRI","cancer","feature extraction","image matching","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","radiation therapy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformable MR prostate segmentation","deep feature learning","sparse patch matching","clinical applications","prostate cancer radiotherapy","accurate MR prostate localization","inhomogeneous prostate boundary appearance","inconsistent prostate boundary appearance","shape variation","handcrafted features","latent feature representation","stacked sparse autoencoder","feature hierarchy","prostate likelihood map","dataset","T2-wighted prostate MR images","state-of-the-art segmentation methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deformable model","MR prostate segmentation","sparse patch matching","stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Machine Learning","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male","Prostate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching","volume":"35","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7353170/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15902265","pubMedId":"26685226","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"CA140413"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching","sourcePdf":"tmi-guo-2508280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143325S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7445273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"7445273","articleId":"7353170","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7353176,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/7416259/7353176/7353176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongzhi Guo (S\u201912) received his B.S. degree in Automation from Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2011 and M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, New York, in 2013.

Plasmonic nanoantennas are expected to enable the communication among nanosensors in the near infrared and optical transmission window. This result motivates the analysis of the phenomena affecting the propagation of such electromagnetic (EM) signals inside the human body. In this paper, a channel model for intra-body optical communication among nanosensors is developed. The total path loss is computed by taking into account the absorption from different types of molecules and the scattering by different types of cells. In particular, first, the impact of a single cell on the propagation of an optical wave is analytically obtained, by modeling a cell as a multi-layer sphere with complex permittivity. Then, the impact of having a large number of cells with different properties arranged in layered tissues is analyzed. The analytical channel model is validated by means of electromagnetic simulations and extensive numerical results are provided to understand the behavior of the intra-body optical wireless channel. The result shows that, at optical frequencies, the scattering loss introduced by cells is much larger than the absorption loss from the medium. This result motivates the utilization of the lower frequencies of the near-infrared window for communication in iWNSNs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7416259/07353176.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2015.2508042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2015.2508042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra-Body Optical Channel Modeling for In Vivo Wireless Nanosensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanobioscience","Optical scattering","Biomedical optical imaging","Plasmons","Manganese","Biological system modeling","Optical propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biological tissues","biomedical communication","biomedical equipment","drug delivery systems","medical computing","medical information systems","multilayers","nanomedicine","nanosensors","numerical analysis","permittivity","plasmonics","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iWNSN communication","near-infrared window","absorption loss","scattering loss","optical frequencies","intrabody optical wireless channel modeling","electromagnetic simulation","analytical channel model","layered tissues","permittivity","multilayer sphere cell","intrabody optical communication","electromagnetic signals","near infrared optical transmission window","nanosensors","plasmonic nanoantennas","drug-delivery applications","intrabody health-monitoring systems","transformative healthcare techniques","nanosized communicating devices","in vivo wireless nanosensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intra-body channel modeling","nanonetworks","plasmonic nanoantenna","wireless nanosensor networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Humans","Models, Biological","Nanomedicine","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Telecommunications","Wireless Technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Intra-Body Optical Channel Modeling for In Vivo Wireless Nanosensor Networks","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7353176/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15803114","pubMedId":"26685260","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra-Body Optical Channel Modeling for In Vivo Wireless Nanosensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tnb-sun-2508042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122251S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7416259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7416259","articleId":"7353176","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353179,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Deng","affiliation":["Xidian University, School of Electronic Engineering, Xi'an, P.

In this area, how to capture and correlate heterogeneous features originating from different modalities remains a challenge. However, most existing methods dealing with cross-modal learning only focus on learning relevant features shared by two distinct feature spaces, therefore overlooking discriminative feature information of them. To remedy this issue and explicitly capture discriminative feature information, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach based on discriminative dictionary learning that is augmented with common label alignment. Concretely, a discriminative dictionary is first learned to account for each modality, which boosts not only the discriminating capability of intra-modality data from different classes but also the relevance of inter-modality data in the same class. Subsequently, all the resulting sparse codes are simultaneously mapped to a common label space, where the cross-modal data samples are characterized and associated. Also in the label space, the discriminativeness and relevance of the considered cross-modal data can be further strengthened by enforcing a common label alignment. Finally, cross-modal retrieval is performed over the common label space.

In NCDCs, tens of thousands of virtual machines (VMs) are assigned to physical servers to provide data-intensive services with a quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee, and consume a massive amount of energy in the process. Although many VM placement schemes have been proposed to solve this problem of energy consumption, most of these assume that all the physical servers are homogeneous. However, the physical server configurations of NCDCs often differ significantly, which leads to varying energy consumption characteristics. In this paper, we explore an alternative VM placement approach to minimize energy consumption during the provision of data-intensive services with a global QoS guarantee in NCDCs. We use an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to develop an optimal VM placement approach involving a tradeoff between energy consumption and global QoS guarantee for data-intensive services. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other approaches to energy optimization and global QoS guarantee in NCDCs.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2508383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7484805/07353181.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2508383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provision of Data-Intensive Services Through Energy- and QoS-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in National Cloud Data Centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353181/","displayDocTitle":"Provision of Data-Intensive Services Through Energy- and QoS-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in National Cloud Data Centers","volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April-June 2016","accessionNumber":"16055099","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353181/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61202435 and 61472047"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005089","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4132048"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014ZD01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provision of Data-Intensive Services Through Energy- and QoS-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in National Cloud Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tetc-hsu-2508383-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081307S","chronDate":"April-June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7484805","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7484805","articleId":"7353181","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353192,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Bonyadi","affiliation":["Data Science Group of Complexica Pty.

The proposed algorithm can be used for highly automated driving on highways or as a sophisticated prediction module for advanced driver-assistance systems with no need for intervehicle communication. The main contribution of this paper is a model-based interaction-aware motion prediction of all vehicles in a scene. In contrast to other state-of-the-art approaches, the system also models the replanning capabilities of all drivers. With that, the driving strategy is able to capture complex interactions between vehicles, thus planning maneuver sequences over longer time horizons. It also enables an accurate prediction of traffic for the next immediate time step. The prediction model is supported by an interpretation of what other drivers intend to do, how they interact with traffic, and the ongoing observation. As part of the prediction loop, the proposed planning strategy incorporates the expected reactions of all traffic participants, offering cooperative and robust driving decisions. By means of experimental results under simulated highway scenarios, the validity of the proposed concept and its real-time capability is demonstrated.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7493708/07353203.pdf","startPage":"3981","endPage":"3992","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7493708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Replanning-Aware Interactive Scene Prediction and Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Replanning-Aware Interactive Scene Prediction and Planning","htmlLink":"/document/7353203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Replanning-Aware Interactive Scene Prediction and Planning","sourcePdf":"tvt-bahram-2508009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103153S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7493708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7493708","articleId":"7353203","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7353207,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Ming Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7493708/7353207/guo-2508020-small.gif","p":["\n\nJing-Ming Guo (M'04\u2013SM'10) received the Ph.D. degree from \nNational Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2004.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and \nTechnology, Taipei.

For example, vehicle flow management can positively benefit the ITSs from accurate road vehicle detection and counting surveillance systems. In this paper, a high-accuracy vehicle detection mechanism with robust and adaptive vehicle mask training is proposed to effectively detect vehicles in nighttime scenarios. First, a preprocessing step is applied to segment vehicle lamps and filter out reflections. Next, the similarity and symmetric degree of light components are classified into vehicle lamp candidates. A simple fog lamp elimination method is proposed for adapting the proposed method to various road conditions. Then, the mask is trained by a combination of color distribution and weighting information, and it is utilized in the first stage of vehicle detection. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is effective and adaptive for the detection of vehicles at night.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Training","Traffic control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicle detection","headlights tracking","nighttime surveillance","intelligent transportation system"]},{"kwd":["Headlight tracking","intelligent transportation system (ITS)","nighttime surveillance","vehicle detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7493708/07353207.pdf","startPage":"4023","endPage":"4032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7493708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nighttime Vehicle Lamp Detection and Tracking With Adaptive Mask Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nighttime Vehicle Lamp Detection and Tracking With Adaptive Mask Training","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353207/","volume":"65","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353207/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nighttime Vehicle Lamp Detection and Tracking With Adaptive Mask Training","sourcePdf":"tvt-guo-2508020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099879S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7493708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7493708","articleId":"7353207","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7353209,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Bing Wu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","School of Sciences, University of Science and Technology at Liaoning, Anshan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7857118/7353209/wu-2503004-small.gif","p":["Li-Bing Wu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematics, Jinzhou Normal College, Jinzhou, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in basic mathematics from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering.","He is currently a Lecturer with the Department of Mathematics, School of Sciences, University of Science and Technology at Liaoning, Anshan, China.

First, based on the intermediate value theorem, a novel design scheme that converts the nonaffine system into the corresponding affine system is developed. In particular, the priori knowledge of the bound of the derivative of the nonaffine and nonlinear functions is removed; then, by employing NNs to approximate the appropriate nonlinear functions, the corresponding adaptive NN tracking controller with the adjustable parameter updated laws is designed through a backstepping technique. Furthermore, it is shown that all the closed-loop signals are bounded in probability, and the system output tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood in the sense of a mean quartic value.

The impulse response determines the shape of the high-voltage pulse that is transmitted and the specifications of the front-end electronics that receive the echo; the impedance determines the specification of the matching network through which the transducer is connected. System-level optimization of these subsystems requires accurate modeling of pulse-echo (two-way) response, which in turn demands a unified simulation of the ultrasonics and electronics. In this paper, this is realized by combining MATLAB/Simulink models of the high-voltage transmitter, the transmission interface, the acoustic subsystem which includes wave propagation and reflection, the receiving interface, and the front-end receiver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our simulator, the models are experimentally validated by comparing the simulation results with the measured data from a commercial ultrasound system. This simulator could be used to quickly provide system-level feedback for an optimized tuning of electronic design parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2508148","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7394996/07353213.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2508148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MATLAB/Simulink Pulse-Echo Ultrasound System Simulator Based on Experimentally Validated Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"MATLAB/Simulink Pulse-Echo Ultrasound System Simulator Based on Experimentally Validated Models","volume":"63","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15754606","pubMedId":"26685232","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7353213/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"R&D Program of MOTIE/KEIT","grantNumber":"10054578"},{"fundingName":"Alpinion Medical Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MATLAB/Simulink Pulse-Echo Ultrasound System Simulator Based on Experimentally Validated Models","sourcePdf":"tuffc-kim-2508148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194194S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7394996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7394996","articleId":"7353213","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7353214,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqian Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenqian","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085385904"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085347342"},{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37277951300"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7353214","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1290},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Channel estimation","MIMO","Uplink","Downlink","Correlation","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","approximation theory","channel estimation","compressed sensing","correlation methods","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel training-and-feedback scheme","FDD massive MIMO systems","frequency-division duplexing massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","future 5G wireless communication systems","channel-state information-at-the-transmitter","CSIT","pilot signaling","channel feedback overhead","temporal correlation","time-varying channels","downlink training overhead reduction","uplink feedback overhead reduction","structured compressive sampling matching pursuit algorithm","S-CoSaMP algorithm","wireless MIMO channels","structured sparsity exploitation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","channel feedback","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","structured sparsity","temporal correlation"]}],"abstract":"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is widely recognized as a promising technology for future 5G wireless communication systems. To achieve the theoretical performance gains in massive MIMO systems, accurate channel-state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is crucial. Due to the overwhelming pilot signaling and channel feedback overhead, however, conventional downlink channel estimation and uplink channel feedback schemes might not be suitable for frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. In addition, these two topics are usually separately considered in the literature. In this paper, we propose a joint channel training and feedback scheme for FDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first exploit the temporal correlation of time-varying channels to propose a differential channel training and feedback scheme, which simultaneously reduces the overhead for downlink training and uplink feedback. We next propose a structured compressive sampling matching pursuit (S-CoSaMP) algorithm to acquire a reliable CSIT by exploiting the structured sparsity of wireless MIMO channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve substantial reduction in the training and feedback overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Training and Feedback for

In this investigation, a low-complexity and noncoherent signal detection technique is proposed to mitigate the inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and additive noise. In contrast to existing coherent detection methods of high complexity, the proposed noncoherent signal detector is more practical when the channel conditions are hard to acquire accurately or hidden from the receiver. The proposed scheme employs the molecular concentration difference to detect the ISI corrupted signals and we demonstrate that it can suppress the ISI effectively. The difference in molecular concentration is a stable characteristic, irrespective of the diffusion channel conditions. In terms of complexity, by excluding matrix operations or likelihood calculations, the new detection scheme is particularly suitable for nanoscale molecular communication systems with a small energy budget or limited computation resource.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2015.2504542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2015.2504542","startPage":"3","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7416259/07353215.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Noncoherent Signal Detection for Nanoscale Molecular Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Noncoherent Signal Detection for Nanoscale Molecular Communications","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15803112","pubMedId":"26685259","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7353215/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Noncoherent Signal Detection for Nanoscale Molecular Communications","sourcePdf":"tnb-wang-2504542-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104599S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7416259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7416259","articleId":"7353215","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7353216,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Shen","affiliation":["School of Communications Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7590228/7353216/shen-2508154-small.gif","p":["\n\nLei Shen received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","From June 2014 to January 2015, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA.

In this paper, a blind decoding method based on independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed without using pilot sequences. The proposed blind decoding method uses ICA to separate the received signals (from in-cell and neighboring cells) and estimate channels. The energy levels of the estimated channels are used to differentiate an in-cell signal from neighboring cell signals. The analytical performance results of the blind decoding method are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed blind decoding scheme outperforms minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) decoding and zero-forcing (ZF) decoding with imperfect channel state information (CSI). The proposed scheme has only a negligible performance loss compared with MMSE decoding and ZF decoding with perfect CSI.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07353216.pdf","startPage":"8322","endPage":"8330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Decoding Based on Independent Component Analysis for a Massive MIMO Uplink System in Microcell Rician/Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","MIMO","Uplink","Fading","Covariance matrices","Yttrium","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","channel estimation","independent component analysis","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind decoding","independent component analysis","massive MIMO uplink system","microcell Rician/Rayleigh fading channels","pilot sequence reuse","pilot contamination","received signals","estimate channels","energy levels","in-cell signal","neighboring cell signals","minimum-mean-square-error decoding","zero-forcing decoding","imperfect channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind decoding","independent component analysis (ICA)","massive multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","minimum mean-square error (MMSE)","zero forcing (ZF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Blind Decoding Based on Independent Component Analysis for a Massive MIMO Uplink System in Microcell Rician/Rayleigh Fading Channels","volume":"65","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7353216/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378680","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401133 and 61372093"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M562302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Decoding Based on Independent Component Analysis for a Massive MIMO Uplink System in Microcell Rician/Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-shen-2508154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099711S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7353216","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7353217,"authors":[{"name":"Tarek Ould-Bachir","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Montral, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Tarek Ould-Bachir (M\u201908) received the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.","From 2013 to 2014, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, with a focus on high-performance field-programmable gate-array (FPGA)-based computing engines for the real-time simulation of power converters.

To minimize ripple cancellation effect, external ramp compensation is used in commercial products. However, external ramp will introduce dynamic to the system and stability margin will be suffered without considering its effect. This paper first studies the effect of external ramp by deriving small-signal transfer function based on describing function method. It is found that external ramp brings additional dynamic, with time constant related with switching period. Then, a simple equivalent circuit model based on three-terminal switch concept is proposed, which considers the effect of external ramp by adding an additional R-L branch. The equivalent circuit model can be reduced to previous unified three-terminal switch model when external ramp is zero and can be reduced to model of constant on-time voltage mode control when external ramp is much larger than inductor current ramp. The proposed three-terminal switch model is a complete model, which can be used to examine all transfer functions and is accurate up to half of switching frequency. The analytical transfer functions are provided for easy reference. The model is verified by SIMPLIS simulation and experimental measurement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2508037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7475920/07353220.pdf","startPage":"7311","endPage":"7319","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2508037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Terminal Switch Model of Constant On-Time Current Mode With External Ramp Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Terminal Switch Model of Constant On-Time Current Mode With External Ramp Compensation","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7353220/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16003759","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Terminal Switch Model of Constant On-Time Current Mode With External Ramp Compensation","sourcePdf":"tpel-tian-2508037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086064S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7475920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7475920","articleId":"7353220","onlineDate":"11 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7353285,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Rodriguez-Diaz","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Denmark"],"bio":{"p":["Enrique Rodriguez-Diaz (erd@et.aau.dk) earned his B.S. degree in electronics engineering and his M.S. degree in sustainable transportation and electrical power systems from the University of Oviedo, Spain, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Europe has led the initiative, moving away from fossil fuels toward renewable energies, while powerful countries such as the United States and China are lagging behind and still rely heavily on coal, gas, and oil as energy sources. Europe has set ambitious goals for 2020 regarding the increase of renewable energy production, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. The concept of a microgrid is perfectly aligned with the new energy strategy. A microgrid eases the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy-storage systems (ESSs) at the consumption level, aiming to increase power quality, reliability, and efficiency. The increasing importance of dc-based loads has reopened the discussion of dc versus ac distribution systems. As a consequence, much research has been done on dc distribution systems and their potential for residential applications. Furthermore, the growing presence and use of smart devices in homes reveal a promising future for intelligent homes integrated in the Internet of Things (IoT), where residential electrical power systems work in cooperation with smart devices to achieve smarter, more sustainable, and cleaner energy systems.","doi":"10.1109/MCE.2015.2484699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962380/7353250/07353285.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCE.2015.2484699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent DC Homes in Future Sustainable Energy Systems: When efficiency and intelligence work together","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353285/","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent DC Homes in Future Sustainable Energy Systems: When efficiency and intelligence work together","volume":"5","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353285/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677417","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent DC Homes in Future Sustainable Energy Systems: When efficiency and intelligence work together","sourcePdf":"05mce01-rodriguez-diaz-2484699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036714S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962380","isNumber":"7353250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962380","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"7353250","articleId":"7353285","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7353286,"authors":[{"name":"Anders S.G.

In this paper, we develop a hardware framework implanted in FPGA with corresponding interface design for the m parameter estimation of the Nakagami-m fading channel. Owing to the advantages of the high-speed hardware calculation, real-scenario estimation and the flexible system design, this newly developed framework can efficiently estimate the real m value with actual data base over a large frequency range. Moreover, it can be easily upgraded by software-based m parameter estimation methods through substituting the estimation algorithm. Most importantly, We evaluate our design with different m parameter estimation algorithms. The experiment results show that our design can properly adapt to different estimation algorithms and efficiently estimate the m value in both high-SNR and low-SNR regimes, thus allow us to observe the true variation of the channel state and make applications according to the observation, which is not attainable through software simulation.","doi":"10.1109/HMWC.2015.7353344","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7323433/7353339/07353344.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HMWC.2015.7353344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General hardware framework of Nakagami m parameter estimator for wireless fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"General hardware framework of Nakagami m parameter estimator for wireless fading channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663911","htmlLink":"/document/7353344/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General hardware framework of Nakagami m parameter estimator for wireless fading channel","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1570190035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052041S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7323433","isNumber":"7353339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7323433","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7353339","articleId":"7353344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353347,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering VSSUT, Burla, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468198800"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering VSSUT, Burla, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Hongyan Li","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Engineering LIET, Vizianagaram, Andhrapradesh, India"],"lastName":"Hongyan Li","id":"37085382792"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7629-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7628-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353347","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353347","abstract":"In this paper, we examine the channel estimation in an amplify-and-forward (AF) one-way relay network (OWRN) under time selective flat fading scenario, where the distributed space-time coding (DSTC) is adopted at relay nodes.

In this paper, we apply GSA in high mobility OFDM systems. To handle the inter-carrier interference (ICI) resulted from large Doppler frequency shift effectively, we propose subcarrier extension (SE)-GSA. Its idea is to treat each subcarrier as a virtual antenna and then apply GSA in the extended virtual MIMO channel. We take the MIMO two-way X relay channel as the system model. It well models to the scenario where a high speed train enters the edge of two adjacent cells and two mobile users inside the train are communicating with the base stations (BSs) through a relay station deployed on the train carriage. By jointly designing the compression matrix and precoding matrices in the virtual antenna domain, both inter-user interference and inter-carrier interference can be managed together. To reduce the computation complexity at the relay, a new method is proposed to design the precoding matrix at each source node. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SE-GSA achieves 25% and 66% higher throughput than the conventional signal alignment (SA) and time division duplex (TDD) transmission schemes, respectively, at high SNR with the train moving speed of 500 km/h.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7323433/7353339/07353349.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","doi":"10.1109/HMWC.2015.7353349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HMWC.2015.7353349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized signal alignment for high mobility OFDM channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","MIMO","Interference","Frequency-domain analysis","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler effect","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","railway communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized signal alignment","high mobility OFDM channels","multiuser MIMO two-way relay channels","intercarrier interference","Doppler frequency shift","subcarrier extension","extended virtual MIMO channel","MIMO two-way X relay channel","system model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Generalized signal alignment for high mobility OFDM channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353349/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663921","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized signal alignment for high mobility OFDM channels","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1570206269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047605S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7323433","isNumber":"7353339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7323433","xplore-issue":"7353339","articleId":"7353349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353351,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"lastName":"Xiang Chen"},{"name":"Feng-Kui Gong","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"lastName":"Feng-Kui Gong"},{"name":"Guo Li","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"lastName":"Guo Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7629-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7628-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353351","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"abstract":"A compensation-based user scheduling (CBUS) for multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems with delayed feedback channel state information (CSI) is proposed.

To continuously explore the nature and character of HSR scenario, this paper mainly aims to investigate the reliability and instantaneous capacity of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system through taking full advantage of diversity gain and positioned-based channel characters. We take both the large and small scale fading into modeling this scenario. Through Monte-Carlo simulation, we give out the bit error rate and the handover success probability for one carriage when applying a low decoding complexity full-rate full-diversity orthogonal space time block coding scheme. Besides, we give out the channel capacity and the total mobile service of one base station (BS) with full multiplexing gain in HSR scenario. After compared with practical measured values, we can draw the conclusion that a single antenna system can hardly meet the requirements of growth-expected wireless communication demands without buffering or subtle transmission scheme designing, which will obviously aggravate the overheads and increase the system complexity. However, a 2\u00d72 antenna system with full multiplexing gain is more than enough to solve this tradeoff dilemma.","doi":"10.1109/HMWC.2015.7353352","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7323433/7353339/07353352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HMWC.2015.7353352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353339","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position-based diversity and multiplexing analysis for high speed railway communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Position-based diversity and multiplexing analysis for high speed railway communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353352/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663914","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353352/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position-based diversity and multiplexing analysis for high speed railway communications","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1570208075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06722S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7323433","isNumber":"7353339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7323433","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7353339","articleId":"7353352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353369,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Dylan Tsai","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hung Dylan","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37075476600"},{"name":"Toshiki Nakamura","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiki","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37085720594"},{"name":"Makoto Kaneko","affiliation":["Department of mechanical engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37274087200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353369","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pressure measurement","Pressure sensors","Microchannels","Robot sensing systems","Color","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hysteresis","lab-on-a-chip","medical control systems","microfluidics","pressure sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip pressure sensor","electricity-free pressure sensor","single-layer pressure sensor","microfluidic applications","Polydimethylsiloxane deformation","pressure sensor hysteresis","pressure sensor drift","pressure 3.04 kPa"]}],"abstract":"A novel method for sensing local pressure inside a microfluidic device is proposed and developed. The main advantage of the method is that the pressure can be visually seen without attaching any electrical wire or instrument. The method can also be easily integrated into applications, such as micro-robots, because of its single-layer design. The working principle is based on the deformation of Polydimethylsiloxane, a kind of polymer that is often used in microfluidic systems. The deformation in the deformation chamber causes fluid to flow in, or out, the sensing area, and consequently results in changes of color intensity in the area. As a result, the pressure can be determined based on the brightness value over the sensing area. Experimental results show a highly correlated relationship between the measured brightness and pressure with the absolute correlation of 0.986. The hysteresis and drift of the proposed sensor are investigated, and are compared with our previously proposed microbeads approach. The prototype of the proposed sensor succeeded in performing measurement on local pressure in a microfluidic device with the resolution of 3.04 kPa.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353369","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353369.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-chip, electricity-free and single-layer pressure sensor for microfluidic applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353369/","displayDocTitle":"An on-chip, electricity-free and single-layer pressure sensor for microfluidic applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667039","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353369/","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-chip, electricity-free and single-layer pressure sensor for microfluidic applications","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070378S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353375,"authors":[{"name":"Carolin Fellmann","affiliation":["Center of Mechatronics (MZH), Leibniz Universitat, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Carolin","lastName":"Fellmann","id":"37085614422"},{"name":"Jessica Burgner-Kahrs","affiliation":["Center of Mechatronics (MZH), Leibniz Universitat, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Burgner-Kahrs","id":"37085433359"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Trajectory","Kinematics","Collision avoidance","Manipulators","Surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","dexterous manipulators","medical robotics","surgery","telerobotics","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory generation strategy","tubular continuum robot","minimally invasive surgery","dexterous manipulator","constrained environment","teleoperated robot","anatomy","pathology","injury","probabilistic path planning method","collision free configuration","obstructed environment","Cartesian path","collision free path planning","medical scenario"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353375","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353375.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implications of trajectory generation strategies for tubular continuum robots","abstract":"Tubular continuum robots are particularly useful for minimally invasive surgery due to their small size and ability to dexterously manipulate in constrained environments. The robot can be used teleoperated or operated (semi-)autonomously. In both cases, safe manipulation has to be ensured considering constraints from the patient's unique anatomy and pathology to prevent injury of nerves, vessels, and soft tissue. While probabilistic path planning methods have been proposed for tubular continuum robots which generate sequences of collision free configurations in obstructed environments, these methods do usually not explicitly consider different trajectory generations. In this paper, we evaluate four trajectory generation strategies in terms of the resulting Cartesian paths and spatial extent of the course of motion. We demonstrate the implication of the different strategies on both collision free path planning and an example medical scenario. In conclusion, consideration of trajectory generation strategies is indispensable, if the distance between intermediate configurations increases - even though those intermediate configurations might be collision free.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353375/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666682","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implications of trajectory generation strategies for tubular continuum robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implications of trajectory generation strategies for tubular continuum robots","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068161S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7353389,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Bloesch","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bloesch","id":"37077142100"},{"name":"Sammy Omari","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sammy","lastName":"Omari","id":"37077953100"},{"name":"Marco Hutter","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Hutter","id":"37545251000"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37085367879"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353389","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":281,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353389","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Robots","Estimation","Technological innovation","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","distance measurement","feature extraction","image resolution","image sensors","Kalman filters","mobile robots","nonlinear filters","object tracking","pose estimation","robot vision","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV","multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle","control loop","power-up-and-go state estimation system","computational performance improvement","inverse-distance landmark parametrization","\u03c3-algebra","landmark position decomposition","3D landmark location estimation","robocentric approach","innovation term","extended Kalman filter","multilevel patch feature tracking","image patches","pixel intensity errors","direct EKF-based approach","robust monocular visual-inertial odometry algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a monocular visual-inertial odometry algorithm which, by directly using pixel intensity errors of image patches, achieves accurate tracking performance while exhibiting a very high level of robustness.

We follow a purely robocentric approach where the location of 3D landmarks are always estimated with respect to the current camera pose. Furthermore, we decompose landmark positions into a bearing vector and a distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal representation of differences on a corresponding \u03c3-Algebra in order to achieve better consistency and to improve the computational performance. Due to the robocentric, inverse-distance landmark parametrization, the framework does not require any initialization procedure, leading to a truly power-up-and-go state estimation system.

This combination eliminates the need for odometric information originating from the robot's motor controller, enabling applications where that information is difficult to obtain, e.g. many electric wheelchairs. The proposed method exploits the programmable spatial sampling capabilities of the 3D sonar system to derive from the same set of received echo signals both an accurate representation of reflectors in the horizontal plane (2D energyscape) and a more coarse representation of reflectors in the frontal hemisphere (3D energyyscape). Using a mapping experiment we demonstrate that the motion estimates originating from the acoustic flow module combined with the coarse frontal hemisphere data provide sufficient information for the mapping module to reconstruct the robot's trajectory.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Sonar","Acoustics","Three-dimensional displays","Microphones","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","robot vision","sampling methods","sensors","SLAM (robots)","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot trajectory","coarse frontal hemisphere data","acoustic flow module","odometric information","bio-inspired mapping module","acoustic flow odometry","egomotion estimation","simultaneous localization-and-mapping","BatSLAM module","3D sonar sensor","spatial sampling strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353452","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353452.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial sampling strategy for a 3D sonar sensor supporting BatSLAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial sampling strategy for a 3D sonar sensor supporting BatSLAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353452/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353452/","accessionNumber":"15667194","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial sampling strategy for a 3D sonar sensor supporting BatSLAM","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050064S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353454,"authors":[{"name":"Timo R\u00f6hling","affiliation":["Fraunhoferstr, Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"R\u00f6hling","id":"37391824000"},{"name":"Jennifer Mack","affiliation":["Fraunhoferstr, Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Mack","id":"37085722703"},{"name":"Dirk Schulz","affiliation":["Fraunhoferstr, Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37331040900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353454","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":881},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Laser radar","Measurement","Simultaneous localization and mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","optical radar","robot vision","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast histogram-based similarity measure","LIDAR loop closure detection","3D LIDAR data","light detection and ranging","field robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353454","abstract":"We present a fast method of detecting loop closure opportunities through the use of similarity measures on histograms extracted from 3-D LIDAR data.

However, most of the work presented so far performs flexible needle steering in static phantoms or non-static virtual environments. The insertion of flexible bevel-tipped needles into soft-tissue subjected to motion disturbances is still an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a flexible needle steering algorithm that is able to handle physiological motion disturbances. The system estimates the disturbance using the force information provided by a force sensor placed in contact with the soft-tissue. The system is evaluated through experiments steering a flexible needle towards a physical target into a moving soft-tissue phantom. Three experimental cases with motion disturbances based on clinical procedures in the lung, kidney and heart are used to assess the targeting error. The average targeting error of all 15 experimental trials is 1:05\u00b10:41mm. Our results demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to compensate for motion disturbances applied to the soft-tissue phantom.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards physiological motion compensation for flexible needle interventions","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353468","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353468.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards physiological motion compensation for flexible needle interventions","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353468/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667408","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards physiological motion compensation for flexible needle interventions","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054554S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353481,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Maturana","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Maturana","id":"37540464600"},{"name":"Sebastian Scherer","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Scherer","id":"37584159000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353481","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":948,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":13222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Object recognition","Laser radar","Sensors","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","neurocontrollers","object recognition","real-time systems","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VoxNet","3D convolutional neural network","real-time object recognition","robust object recognition","robots","range sensors","point cloud data","volumetric occupancy grid representation"]}],"abstract":"Robust object recognition is a crucial skill for robots operating autonomously in real world environments.

To achieve this goal, in teleimpedance control, a reference command which consists of the stiffness and position profiles of the master is computed and realized by the compliant slave robot in real-time. This highlights the need for a suitable and computationally efficient tracking of the human limb stiffness profile in real-time. In this direction, based on the observations in human neuromotor control which give evidence on the predominant use of the arm configuration in directional adjustments of the endpoint stiffness profile, and the role of muscular co-activations which contribute to a coordinated regulation of the task stiffness in all directions, we propose a novel and computationally efficient model of the arm endpoint stiffness behaviour. Real-time tracking of the human arm kinematics is achieved using an arm triangle monitored by three markers placed at the shoulder, elbow and wrist level. In addition, a co-contraction index is defined using muscular activities of a dominant antagonistic muscle pair. Calibration and identification of the model parameters are carried out experimentally, using perturbation-based arm endpoint stiffness measurements in different arm configurations and co-contraction levels of the chosen muscles. Results of this study suggest that the proposed model enables the master to naturally execute a remote task by modulating the direction of the major axes of the endpoint stiffness and its volume using arm configuration and the co-activation of the involved muscles, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353495","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced-complexity description of arm endpoint stiffness with applications to teleimpedance control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A reduced-complexity description of arm endpoint stiffness with applications to teleimpedance control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353495/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667244","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353495/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced-complexity description of arm endpoint stiffness with applications to teleimpedance control","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086354S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353554,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Preda","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Preda","id":"37078321300"},{"name":"Auralius Manurung","affiliation":["Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Auralius","lastName":"Manurung","id":"37601301100"},{"name":"Olivier Lambercy","affiliation":["Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Lambercy","id":"37394464200"},{"name":"Roger Gassert","affiliation":["Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Gassert","id":"37274023900"},{"name":"Marcello Bonf\u00e8","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Bonf\u00e8","id":"37300903100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353554","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Kinematics","Robot kinematics","Manipulators","Yarn","Medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","control engineering computing","manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","sampling methods","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion planning","multiarm surgical robot","sampling-based algorithm","motion primitive","control software architecture","parallel/serial kinematics","collision-free path planner","RRT-Connect algorithm","Cartesian space","robot inverse kinematics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353554","abstract":"The paper describes a motion planning and control software architecture developed for the automation of a surgical robot.

A highly compliant hand allows for intrinsic robustness to grasping uncertainty, but the specific configuration of the hand and object is not known, leaving undetermined if a grasp was successful in picking up the right object. A soft finger was adapted and combined to form a three finger gripper that can easily be attached to existing robots, for example, to the wrist of the Baxter robot. Resistive bend sensors were added within each finger to provide a configuration estimate sufficient for distinguishing between a set of objects.

To enable personalised assistance, such robots benefit from building a user-specific model, so that the assistance is customised to the particular set of user abilities. In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach for home-environment assistive humanoid robots to provide personalised assistance through a dressing application for users who have upper-body movement limitations. We use randomised decision forests to estimate the upper-body pose of users captured by a top-view depth camera, and model the movement space of upper-body joints using Gaussian mixture models. The movement space of each upper-body joint consists of regions with different reaching capabilities. We propose a method which is based on real-time upper-body pose and user models to plan robot motions for assistive dressing. We validate each part of our approach and test the whole system, allowing a Baxter humanoid robot to assist human to wear a sleeveless jacket.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User modelling for personalised dressing assistance by humanoid robots","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353617","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353617.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"User modelling for personalised dressing assistance by humanoid robots","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353617/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667154","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User modelling for personalised dressing assistance by humanoid robots","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064156S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353651,"authors":[{"name":"Junghee Park","affiliation":["Robotic Mobility Group, Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Junghee","lastName":"Park","id":"37085691687"},{"name":"Karl Iagnemma","affiliation":["Robotic Mobility Group, Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Iagnemma","id":"37275974900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353651","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"abstract":"This paper proposes a method for safe navigation based on representative sample inputs.

Yet, few results are available that merge both bi-directional search and asymptotic optimality into existing optimal planners, such as PRM*, RRT*, and FMT*. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, this paper presents a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptotically-optimal algorithm named Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to bi-directional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT* performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in cost-to-come space from the initial configuration and another in cost-to-go space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art planners.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353652","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353652.pdf","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2078","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithm for Bi-directional motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"An asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithm for Bi-directional motion planning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353652/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667390","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","pubMedId":"27004130","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353652/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithm for Bi-directional motion planning","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062818S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7353660,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Bergner","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Miinchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Bergner","id":"37085742718"},{"name":"Philipp Mittendorfer","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Miinchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Mittendorfer","id":"37846360700"},{"name":"Emmanuel Dean-Leon","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Miinchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Dean-Leon","id":"38271985500"},{"name":"Gordon Cheng","affiliation":["Institute for Cognitive Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Miinchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37276253300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353660","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353660","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skin","Robot sensing systems","Computer architecture","Robustness","Microcontrollers","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-based signaling","data rates","processing power","large-scale artificial robotic skin","bandwidth requirements","data transmission","send-on-delta principle","tactile sensors","standard nonevent based method","event-based method","CellulARSkin cells","UR-5 arm","optimal packet size","unstimulated skin cell network","heavily stimulated skin cell network","event-based system","transmission rates"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353660","startPage":"2124","endPage":"2129","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353660.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-based signaling for reducing required data rates and processing power in a large-scale artificial robotic skin","abstract":"In this paper we propose event-based signaling for large-scale artificial robotic skin to reduce bandwidth requirements on data transmission and processing power.

For this purpose we collect data of 260 CellulARSkin cells on an UR-5 arm and calculate the events off-line. We determine the optimal packet size for event-based signaling and we show that the event-based system reduces the data rate with respect to the non-event based system for an unstimulated skin cell network to 16.45% and for a heavily stimulated skin cell network to 47.69%.

Being able to conform to complex curves in 3D space, continuum robots are in particular useful for applications in restricted and hardly accessible environments. The workspace of a tendon-driven continuum robot depends on the number of sections, as well as the length of each section and its range of bending radii. Common tendon-driven robot designs have fixed section lengths such that deployment along a tortuous paths requires additional linear translation of the whole robot. In this paper, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. A telescoping backbone allows control of the section length during operation in addition to bending through tendon actuation. Thus, the arc length of a section can vary and the range of bending radii is enlarged. As a result, the novel robot design inherently allows for deployment along tortuous paths in a follow-the-leader fashion. We suggest the use of spacer disks equipped with permanent magnets with alternating pole orientation. The magnetic repulsion forces enable equidistant spacing of the disks at any lengths of a robot section. We prove the concepts of our novel design with experiments using a first prototype.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353661.pdf","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2135","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Manipulators","Tendons","Prototypes","Pneumatic systems","Neodymium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","discs (structures)","manipulators","permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equidistant disk spacing","magnetic repulsion forces","alternating pole orientation","permanent magnets","spacer disks","follow-the-leader fashion","tendon actuation","telescoping backbone","linear translation","tortuous paths","fixed section lengths","tendon-driven robot designs","3D space","rigid link serial manipulators","extensible sections","tendon-driven continuum robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"A tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353661/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667003","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096761S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353680,"authors":[{"name":"Axel Hackbarth","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Ocean Engineering, Hamburg University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Hackbarth","id":"37085729736"},{"name":"Edwin Kreuzer","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Ocean Engineering, Hamburg University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Kreuzer","id":"37622316900"},{"name":"Eugen Solowjow","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Ocean Engineering, Hamburg University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Eugen","lastName":"Solowjow","id":"37947855300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353680","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":758},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353680","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Hippocampus","Robot sensing systems","Underwater vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","microrobots","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HippoCampus","microautonomous underwater vehicle","swarm robotics research","software design","hardware design","communication link","instrumentation","control system","quadrotor design","vehicle navigation","on-board sensor suite","autonomous path following","AUV"]}],"abstract":"The HippoCampus platform is a low-cost micro autonomous underwater vehicle for swarm robotics research.

This paper presents an accurate but computationally fast quasi-metric to determine the proximity of dynamic states of a quadrotor, and an incremental state-space sampling technique to avoid generating local trajectories that violate kinodynamic constraints.

However, the application of solar powered flight to small scale solar powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has seen sparse research activity and is only partially explored. The use of solar power as an energy resource allows small scale UAVs to carry heavier, more powerful sensor payloads, and can extend flight times to over 24 hours, thereby achieving multi-day flight.

However, as we leave the lab and move out in the world, models of the environment no longer span distances of meters but kilometers in length. Now, gigabytes instead of megabytes of memory are required to hold the model of the environment required for localization. Discarding data and keeping the map representation compact is thus essential for any meaningful application. This paper presents and evaluates a map compression algorithm that approaches this data-reduction as an constrained optimization problem. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map we have to satisfy the conflicting goals of map coverage and localizability as well as our tight memory budget. While using an optimization approach for compression is not novel, in this paper we propose adaptations to drastically reduce the computational requirements. Our approach improves scalability from trajectories of a few tens of meters manageable by the state of the art to virtually unlimited dataset sizes in our system. We evaluate the performance of various compression levels as well as several methods for selecting the best localization landmarks from outdoor datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353722.pdf","startPage":"2536","endPage":"2542","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keep it brief: Scalable creation of compressed localization maps","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Computational modeling","Robots","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Cameras","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","data reduction","image coding","image matching","integer programming","linear programming","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer linear programming","outdoor datasets","landmark localization","compression levels","performance evaluation","scalability improvement","computational requirement reduction","map coverage","landmark assignment","place recognition","summary map","constrained optimization problem","data-reduction","map compression algorithm","map representation","data discarding","manipulation","obstacle avoidance","path planning","scalable compressed localization map creation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Keep it brief: Scalable creation of compressed localization maps","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15666830","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keep it brief: Scalable creation of compressed localization maps","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056597S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7353738,"authors":[{"name":"Oktay Arslan","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Oktay","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37572575200"},{"name":"Panagiotis Tsiotras","affiliation":["D.

We focus on the ability to learn visual-motor relationships, which can work as a reusable memory in association of drawing motion from a picture image. Assuming that a humanoid robot can draw a shape on a pen tablet, the proposed model learns drawing sequences, which comprises drawing motion and drawn picture image frames. To learn raw pixel data without any given specific features, we utilized a deep neural network for compressing large dimensional picture images and a continuous time recurrent neural network for integration of motion and picture images. To confirm the ability of the proposed model, we performed an experiment for learning 15 sequences comprising three types of shapes. The model successfully learns all the sequences and can associate a drawing motion from a not trained picture image and a trained picture with similar success. We also show that the proposed model self-organizes its behavior according to types shapes.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353752","startPage":"2736","endPage":"2741","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353752.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based model for visual-motor integration learning of robot's drawing behavior: Association of a drawing motion from a drawn image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Robots","Training","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","humanoid robots","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based model","visual-motor integration learning","robot drawing behavior","drawing motion","robot drawing sequence","visual-motor relationship","reusable memory","trained picture image","continuous time recurrent neural network","raw pixel data","drawn picture image frame","pen tablet","humanoid robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based model for visual-motor integration learning of robot's drawing behavior: Association of a drawing motion from a drawn image","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353752/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667090","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based model for visual-motor integration learning of robot's drawing behavior: Association of a drawing motion from a drawn image","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105273S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7353754,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unlike other reported sole needles, presented microneedle is divided into two half parts, each is shaped like eaves-trough and dependently moved. The combined halves act as one hollow microneedle, which can draw up human blood by capillary action. The resistive force during insertion can be reduced when the two halves are alternately advanced, which mimics the motion of mosquito's proboscis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353754/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667146","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ultrafine three-dimensional (3D) laser lithographic fabrication of microneedle and its application to painless insertion and blood sampling inspired by mosquito","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrafine three-dimensional (3D) laser lithographic fabrication of microneedle and its application to painless insertion and blood sampling inspired by mosquito","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"2219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060588S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7353785,"authors":[{"name":"I\u00f1aki Navarro","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ecole Poly technique Federale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"I\u00f1aki","lastName":"Navarro","id":"38275723700"},{"name":"Ezequiel Di Mario","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ecole Poly technique Federale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"Ezequiel","lastName":"Di Mario","id":"38228063500"},{"name":"Alcherio Martinoli","affiliation":["Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ecole Poly technique Federale de Lausanne"],"firstName":"Alcherio","lastName":"Martinoli","id":"37325252600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353785","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353785","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Collision avoidance","Measurement","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","neurocontrollers","particle swarm optimisation","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed particle swarm optimization","particle allocation","neighborhood topologies","cooperative robotic behavior learning","automatic controllers synthesis","multiple mobile robots","distributed noise-resistant variations","PSO","artificial neural network","on-board resources","robot experiments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353785","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353785.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","startPage":"2958","endPage":"2965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Particle Swarm Optimization - particle allocation and neighborhood topologies for the learning of cooperative robotic behaviors","abstract":"In this article we address the automatic synthesis of controllers for the coordinated movement of multiple mobile robots, as a canonical example of cooperative robotic behavior. We use five distributed noise-resistant variations of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to learn in simulation a set of 50 weights of an artificial neural network. They differ on the way the particles are allocated and evaluated on the robots, and on how the PSO neighborhood is implemented. In addition, we use a centralized approach that allows for benchmarking with the distributed versions. Regardless of the learning approach, each robot measures locally and individually the performance of the group using exclusively on-board resources. Results show that four of the distributed variations obtain similar fitnesses as the centralized version, and are always able to learn. The other distributed variation fails to properly learn on some of the runs, and results in lower fitness when it succeeds. We test systematically the controllers learned in simulation in real robot experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353785/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15667309","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353785/","publicationDate":"September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Particle Swarm Optimization - particle allocation and neighborhood topologies for the learning of cooperative robotic behaviors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Particle Swarm Optimization - particle allocation and neighborhood topologies for the learning of cooperative robotic behaviors","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076894S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7353786,"authors":[{"name":"Alec Koppel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Alec","lastName":"Koppel","id":"37085457697"},{"name":"Garrett Warnell","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Computational and Information Sciences Directorate, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783, USA"],"firstName":"Garrett","lastName":"Warnell"},{"name":"Ethan Stump","affiliation":["U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Computational and Information Sciences Directorate, Adelphi, MD"],"firstName":"Ethan","lastName":"Stump","id":"37085639232"},{"name":"Alejandro Ribeiro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37266493600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353786","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"abstract":"We consider discriminative dictionary learning in a distributed online setting, where a team of networked robots aims to jointly learn both a common basis of the feature space and a classifier over this basis from sequentially observed signals.

Only neighboring nodes in the communications network need to exchange information, and we penalize the discrepency between the individual feature basis and classifiers using Lagrange multipliers. The application we consider is for a team of robots to collaboratively recognize objects of interest in dynamic environments. As a preliminary performance benchmark, we consider the problem of learning a texture classifier across a network of robots moving around an urban setting where separate training examples are sequentially observed at each robot. Results are shown for both a standard texture dataset and a new dataset from an urban training facility, and we compare the performance of the standard centralized construction to the new distributed algorithm for the case when distinct samples from all classes are seen by the robots. These experiments yield comparable performance between the decentralized and the centralized cases, demonstrating the proposed method's practical utility.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353786.pdf","startPage":"2966","endPage":"2973","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D4L: Decentralized dynamic discriminative dictionary learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Stochastic processes","Encoding","Robots","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image texture","multi-robot systems","object recognition","robot vision","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["D4L","decentralized dynamic discriminative dictionary learning","distributed online setting","networked robots","feature space","distributed stochastic program","nonconvex objective","Arrow-Hurwicz saddle point algorithm","communications network","Lagrange multipliers","object recognition","texture classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"D4L: Decentralized dynamic discriminative dictionary learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667143","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D4L: Decentralized dynamic discriminative dictionary learning","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160175S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353809,"authors":[{"name":"Kejie Qiu","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Kejie","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37085375883"},{"name":"Fangyi Zhang","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology"],"firstName":"Fangyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085383676"},{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085654710"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353809","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":762},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Bayes methods","Gaussian processes","Electron tubes","Light sources","Optoelectronic and photonic sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","free-space optical communication","Gaussian processes","indoor environment","indoor navigation","mobile robots","optical information processing","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communication-based indoor localization","mobile robots","position-based service","healthcare service","localization precision","VLC system","indoor environment","modulated LED lights","beacons","illumination","light source intensity distribution","Bayesian localization framework","path planning","Gaussian process variance field","Dijkstra algorithm-based path-planner","tablet PC"]}],"abstract":"For mobile robots and position-based services, such as healthcare service, precise localization is the most fundamental capability while low-cost localization solutions are with increasing need and potentially have a wide market. A low-cost localization solution based on a novel Visible Light Communication (VLC) system for indoor environments is proposed in this paper. A number of modulated LED lights are used as beacons to aid indoor localization additional to illumination. A Gaussian Process(GP) is used to model the intensity distributions of the light sources. A Bayesian localization framework is constructed using the results of the GP, leading to precise localization. Path-planning is hereby feasible by only using the GP variance field, rather than using a metric map. Dijkstra's algorithm-based path-planner is adopted to cope with the practical situations.

Communication from the fixed-position modules is one-way, allowing the system to scale to multiple robots.

This paper describes the algorithmic underpinnings of the system, discusses design decisions and their impact on the performance of the resulting localization, and highlights challenges faced during implementation. Performance of the localization system is experimentally verified through comparison with data from a motion-capture system.

PRMs and variants contain several phases during roadmap generation i.e., sampling, connection, and query. Some work has been done to apply machine learning to the connection phase to decide which variant to employ, but it uses a global learning approach that is inefficient in heterogeneous situations. We present an algorithm that instead uses local learning: it only considers the performance history in the vicinity of the current connection attempt and uses this information to select good candidates for connection. It thus removes any need to explicitly partition the environment which is burdensome and typically difficult to do. Our results show that our method learns and adapts in heterogeneous environments, including a KUKA youBot with a fixed and mobile base. It finds solution paths faster for single and multi-query scenarios and builds roadmaps with better coverage and connectivity given a fixed amount of time in a wide variety of input problems. In all cases, our method outperforms the previous adaptive connection method and is comparable or better than the best individual method.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353825","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353825.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353825","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","startPage":"3227","endPage":"3234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved roadmap connection via local learning for sampling based planners","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved roadmap connection via local learning for sampling based planners","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353825/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353825/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677842","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved roadmap connection via local learning for sampling based planners","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131044S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7353829,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Kuntz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Kuntz","id":"37085508764"},{"name":"Luis G.

Biopsy is typically required for a definitive diagnosis, but current low-risk clinical options for lung biopsy cannot access all biopsy sites. We introduce a motion planner for a multilumen transoral lung access system, a new system that has the potential to perform safe biopsies anywhere in the lung, which could enable more effective early-stage diagnosis of lung cancer. The system consists of three stages in which a bronchoscope is deployed transorally to the lung, a concentric tube robot pierces through the bronchial tubes into the lung parenchyma, and a steerable needle deploys through a properly oriented concentric tube and steers through the lung parenchyma to the target site while avoiding anatomical obstacles such as significant blood vessels. A sampling-based motion planner computes actions for each stage of the system and considers the coupling of the stages in an efficient manner. We demonstrate the motion planner's fast performance and ability to compute plans with high clearance from obstacles in simulated anatomical scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353829","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ

However, cloth state estimation using a depth sensor is a challenging problem with inherent ambiguity. To address this problem, we propose the offline learning of a cloth dynamics model by incorporating reliable motion capture data and applying this model for the online tracking of human-cloth relationship using a depth sensor. In this study, we evaluate the performance of using a shared Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model in learning the dynamics of clothing articles. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of shared GP-LVM in capturing cloth dynamics using few data samples and the ability to generalize to unseen settings. We further demonstrate three key factors that affect the predictive performance of the trained dynamics model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353860/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667099","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cloth dynamics modeling in latent spaces and its application to robotic clothing assistance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloth dynamics modeling in latent spaces and its application to robotic clothing assistance","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088455S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7353868,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Keshmiri","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Soheil","lastName":"Keshmiri","id":"37089145831"},{"name":"Xin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"lastName":"Xin Zheng","id":"37085723015"},{"name":"Lu Wen Feng","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"lastName":"Lu Wen Feng","id":"37085738686"},{"name":"Chee Khiang Pang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"lastName":"Chee Khiang Pang","id":"37301384000"},{"name":"Chee Meng Chew","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"lastName":"Chee Meng Chew","id":"37289929100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353868","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Estimation","Computer architecture","Training data","Neural networks","Yttrium","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture","neurocontrollers","parameter estimation","regression analysis","transforms","welding","welds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["welding techniques","nonlinear regression model","classifier","deep network architecture","linear transformation","Sigmoid function","four-hidden-layer neural network architecture","welding tasks","weld bead parameters estimation","deep learning approach","deep neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353868","abstract":"We present a deep learning approach to estimation of the bead parameters in welding tasks.

In autonomous driving scenarios, other traffic participants are often occluded from sensor measurements by buildings or large vehicles like buses or trucks, which makes tracking dynamic objects challenging.We present a method to augment standard dynamic object trackers with means to 1) estimate the occluded state of other traffic agents and 2) robustly associate the occluded estimates with new observations after the tracked object reenters the visible region of the sensor horizon. We perform occluded state estimation using a dynamics model that accounts for the driving behavior of traffic agents and a hybrid Gaussian mixture model (hGMM) to capture multiple hypotheses over discrete behavior, such as driving along different lanes or turning left or right at an intersection. Upon new observations, we associate them to existing estimates in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and using a real-world traffic-tracking dataset from an autonomous vehicle platform. Results show that our method can handle significantly prolonged occlusions when compared to a standard dynamic object tracking system.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353874","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353874.pdf","startPage":"3559","endPage":"3565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmented vehicle tracking under occlusions for decision-making in autonomous driving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Augmented vehicle tracking under occlusions for decision-making in autonomous driving","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353874/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667093","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented vehicle tracking under occlusions for decision-making in autonomous driving","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051833S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":7353910,"authors":[{"name":"Konrad Leibrandt","affiliation":["Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom","Imperial College PhD Scholarship Scheme"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Leibrandt","id":"37085413472"},{"name":"Christos Bergeles","affiliation":["Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom","NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Bergeles","id":"37399073100"},{"name":"Guang-Zhong Yang","affiliation":["Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Guang-Zhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085364872"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353910","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Electron tubes","Kinematics","Collision avoidance","Jacobian matrices","Navigation","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","collision avoidance","control engineering computing","manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-line collision-free inverse kinematics","frictional active constraints","unstable concentric tube robot control","catheter-sized robots","natural anatomical pathways","deep-seated pathologies","telemanipulation","anatomical obstacle avoidance","unstable configurations","elongated curved robots","Jacobian approximations","configuration-space precomputation","multicore computer architectures","concentric tube robot mechanics models","anatomical collisions","viscoelastic force fields","safe configurations","realistic clinical scenarios"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353910","abstract":"Concentric tube robots are catheter-sized robots that are ideally suited for navigating along natural anatomical pathways and treating deep-seated pathologies. Their telemanipulation in dynamic environments requires on-line computation of inverse kinematics with simultaneous avoidance of anatomical obstacles. Moreover, unstable configurations, which arise for elongated curved robots that navigate extremely tortuous paths, must be avoided. To achieve on-line computations, existing work has investigated Jacobian approximations and configuration-space precomputation. This paper leverages the state-of-the-art multi-core computer architectures to deliver real-time local inverse kinematics solutions using the established concentric tube robot mechanics models while avoiding both instabilities and anatomical collisions. Furthermore, it considers frictional active constraints for concentric tube robots, i.e. viscoelastic force fields that guide the operator away from obstacles and towards safe configurations.

There are many motion planning problems, including flight coordination and autonomous vehicles, that require an algorithm to predict obstacle motion and plan safely. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (SES)-based planning, a novel framework to efficiently predict and produce safe trajectories in the presence of stochastic obstacles. The stochastic obstacles can be introduced in several ways including stochastic motion or position/speed uncertainty. SES-based planning works by first predicting an obstacle's future position offline through an ensemble of Monte Carlo simulations. These runs simulate the stochastic obstacle dynamics and store the simulation results in temporal snapshots of predicted positions. An online planner then uses this output to identify a predicted collision-free direct path to the goal. If the direct path is not expected to be collision-free, a more expensive tree-based planner is used. Our experiments show SES-based planning outperforms other methods that have high planning success in environments with 900 stochastically moving obstacles. Furthermore, our method plans trajectories with an 80% success rate for a 7 DOF robot in an environment with 250 stochastic moving obstacles and 50 obstacles with speed/position uncertainty. This complex problem is currently beyond the capability of several comparison methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Ensemble Simulation motion planning in stochastic dynamic environments","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353916","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353916.pdf","startPage":"3836","endPage":"3843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Ensemble Simulation motion planning in stochastic dynamic environments","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353916/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15666897","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Ensemble Simulation motion planning in stochastic dynamic environments","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071765S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353917,"authors":[{"name":"Bai Li","affiliation":["College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bai","lastName":"Li","id":"37085459453"},{"name":"Kexin Wang","affiliation":["College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kexin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37535222000"},{"name":"Zhijiang Shao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology","College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhijiang","lastName":"Shao","id":"37535174900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353917","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1082},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Vehicles","Agricultural machinery","Planning","Optimal control","Kinematics","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","mobile robots","motion control","path planning","time optimal control","trajectory control","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-optimal trajectory planning","simultaneous dynamic optimization","autonomous tractor-trailer vehicle design","time-dependent constraints","optimal control","kinematics","mechanical constraints","physical constraints","environmental requirements","optimization criterion","backing-up maneuver","jackknife","interior-point method based simultaneous approach"]}],"abstract":"Trajectory planning is a critical aspect of autonomous tractor-trailer vehicle design. Trajectory planning algorithms usually compute paths first, trajectories are obtained thereafter. This multi-step feature makes those planners inefficacious to handle time-dependent constraints. In this study, we consider the original trajectory planning mission directly, which is described as an optimal control problem containing the kinematics, mechanical/physical constraints, environmental requirements as well as an optimization criterion. In this formulation, only the fundamental driving principles with no special issues (e.g., backing-up maneuver and jackknife) are considered. For example, the prevailing \u201csmall-angle assumption\u201d is not utilized to prevent jackknifing. Instead, we only require that different parts of a tractor-trailer vehicle should not collide, since the emergence of jackknife does not physically violate the kinematics. An interior-point method based simultaneous approach is adopted to solve the formulated optimal control problem. Simulation results verify our proposal is capable of handling scenarios with various user-specified requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-optimal trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles via simultaneous dynamic optimization","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353917","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353917.pdf","startPage":"3844","endPage":"3849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Time-optimal trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles via simultaneous dynamic optimization","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353917/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667071","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-optimal trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles via simultaneous dynamic optimization","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0666S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353931,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal Gohl","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Gohl","id":"37085395317"},{"name":"Dominik Honegger","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Geometry Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Honegger","id":"38540989300"},{"name":"Sammy Omari","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sammy","lastName":"Omari","id":"37077953100"},{"name":"Markus Achtelik","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Autonomous Systems Lab, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Achtelik","id":"38252461700"},{"name":"Marc Pollefeys","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Geometry Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Pollefeys","id":"37271138500"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37281398300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353931","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":479},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omnidirectional visual obstacle detection using embedded FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353931.pdf","startPage":"3938","endPage":"3943","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353931","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Cameras","Collision avoidance","Three-dimensional displays","Field programmable gate arrays","Head"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","collision avoidance","field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","image sensors","microrobots","mobile robots","object detection","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual obstacle detection","FPGA-based dense reconstruction","autonomous navigation","microaerial vehicle","MAV","lightweight sensor","stereo head","inertial measurement unit","IMU","image sensor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353931","abstract":"For autonomous navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in cluttered environments, it is essential to detect potential obstacles not only in the direction of flight but in their entire local environment.

We present a novel light-weight sensor setup comprising of four stereo heads and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to perform FPGA-based dense reconstruction for obstacle detection in all directions. As the data-rate scales up with the number of cameras we use an FPGA to perform streaming based tasks in real-time and show a light-weight polar-coordinate map to allow a companion computer to fully process the data of all the cameras and perform obstacle detection in real-time. The system is able to process up to 80 frames per second (fps) freely distributed on the four stereo heads while maintaining a low power budget. The perception system including FPGA, image sensors and stereo mounts is 235 g in weight.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667200","htmlLink":"/document/7353931/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Omnidirectional visual obstacle detection using embedded FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Omnidirectional visual obstacle detection using embedded FPGA","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055446S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7353950,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Chi Chan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Kai-Chi","lastName":"Chan","id":"37077731200"},{"name":"Cheng-Kok Koh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Cheng-Kok","lastName":"Koh","id":"37266912100"},{"name":"C.

However, designing factors is laborious and yet, the designed factors may not represent the underlying probability distributions. In this paper, we propose to use a neural network to automatically design factors in one of the existing models called the action-mixture model (AMM). Factors that are designed automatically by neural networks can be adapted to different situations. The semantic meaning of random variables in AMM can be transferred to a neural network, rendering the semantic meaning of hidden neurons transparent to users. The design process consists of two stages: structure identification and parameter learning. In the structure identification, we propose a bottom-up approach to build a neural network while preserving the structure of AMM. In the parameter learning, we propose a part-based approach to learn synaptic weights by decomposing a neural network into parts. Synaptic weights that have been learnt in one part can be used as initial weights for learning synaptic weights in another part. Based on the concept of distributed representation, the proposed two-stage, neural-network-based design process is used to design a scalable neural network to realize an AMM. Experimental results showed that the scalable neural network outperformed AMM and some existing works.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353950","startPage":"4059","endPage":"4064","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353950.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-pose estimation with neural-network realization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Random variables","Estimation","Semantics","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-pose estimation","neural-network realization","action-mixture model","AMM","structure identification","parameter learning","part-based approach","neural-network-based design process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Human-pose estimation with neural-network realization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667418","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-pose estimation with neural-network realization","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099897S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7353959,"authors":[{"name":"Neel Doshi","affiliation":["Harvard University, John A.

The model is derived from first principles and has led to a more comprehensive understanding of the components in this transmission. In particular, an empirical model of the dynamic properties of the compliant Kapton flexures is developed and verified against theoretical results from beam and vibration theory. Furthermore, the fabrication of the piezoelectric bending actuators that drive the transmission is improved to match theoretical performance predictions. The transmission model is validated against experimental data taken on HAMR for the quasi-static (1\u201310 Hz) operating mode, and is used to redesign the transmission for improved performance in this regime. The model based redesign results in a 266% increase in the work done by the foot when compared to a previous version of HAMR. This leads to a payload capacity of 2.9g, which is \u223c 2\u00d7 the robot's mass and a 114% increase. Finally, the model is validated in the dynamic regime (40\u2013150 Hz) and the merits of a second order linear approximation are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353959","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353959.pdf","startPage":"4119","endPage":"4126","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model driven design for flexure-based Microrobots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Model driven design for flexure-based Microrobots","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353959/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15666677","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353959/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model driven design for flexure-based Microrobots","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079972S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7353968,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsuro Yamada","affiliation":["Department of Intermedia Art and Science, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuro","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37085664315"},{"name":"Shingo Murata","affiliation":["Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Murata","id":"37085384128"},{"name":"Hiroaki Arie","affiliation":["Department of Intermedia Art and Science, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Arie","id":"37426879900"},{"name":"Tetsuya Ogata","affiliation":["Department of Intermedia Art and Science, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37273829100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353968","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Training data","Hidden Markov models","Semantics","Pragmatics","Neurons","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","human-robot interaction","legged locomotion","recurrent neural nets","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attractor representations","language-behavior structure","recurrent neural network","human-robot interaction","integrative language learning","cyclic attractors","interaction flow representation","internal dynamics","network training data","interaction series","self-organized semantic structure","verbal direction","internal state","branch structures","forward dynamics","linguistic directions","fixed-point attractor","self-organized internal structure","forward dynamics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353968","abstract":"In recent years there has been increased interest in studies that explore integrative learning of language and other modalities by using neural network models. However, for practical application to human-robot interaction, the acquired semantic structure between language and meaning has to be available immediately and repeatably whenever necessary, just as in everyday communication. As a solution to this problem, this study proposes a method in which a recurrent neural network self-organizes cyclic attractors that reflect semantic structure and represent interaction flows in its internal dynamics. To evaluate this method we design a simple task in which a human verbally directs a robot, which responds appropriately. Training the network with training data that represent the interaction series, the cyclic attractors that reflect the semantic structure is self-organized. The network first receives a verbal direction, and its internal state moves according to the first half of the cyclic attractors with branch structures corresponding to semantics. After that, the internal state reaches a potential to generate appropriate behavior. Finally, the internal state moves to the second half and converges on the initial point of the cycle while generating the appropriate behavior. By self-organizing such an internal structure in its forward dynamics, the model achieves immediate and repeatable response to linguistic directions. Furthermore, the network self-organizes a fixed-point attractor, and so able to wait for directions. It can thus repeat the interaction flexibly without explicit turn-taking signs.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353968","startPage":"4179","endPage":"4184","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353968.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attractor representations of language-behavior structure in a recurrent neural network for human-robot interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353968/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Attractor representations of language-behavior structure in a recurrent neural network for human-robot interaction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353968/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15666810","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attractor representations of language-behavior structure in a recurrent neural network for human-robot interaction","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082213S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7353986,"authors":[{"name":"Niko S\u00fcnderhauf","affiliation":["ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)"],"firstName":"Niko","lastName":"S\u00fcnderhauf","id":"37563890800"},{"name":"Sareh Shirazi","affiliation":["ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)"],"firstName":"Sareh","lastName":"Shirazi","id":"37085607927"},{"name":"Feras Dayoub","affiliation":["ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)"],"firstName":"Feras","lastName":"Dayoub","id":"37866588000"},{"name":"Ben Upcroft","affiliation":["ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Upcroft","id":"37565203200"},{"name":"Michael Milford","affiliation":["ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Milford","id":"37283633100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353986","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":226,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1494},"abstract":"After the incredible success of deep learning in the computer vision domain, there has been much interest in applying Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features in robotic fields such as visual navigation and SLAM. Unfortunately, there are fundamental differences and challenges involved. Computer vision datasets are very different in character to robotic camera data, real-time performance is essential, and performance priorities can be different. This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the utility of three state-of-the-art ConvNets on the problems of particular relevance to navigation for robots; viewpoint-invariance and condition-invariance, and for the first time enables real-time place recognition performance using ConvNets with large maps by integrating a variety of existing (locality-sensitive hashing) and novel (semantic search space partitioning) optimization techniques. We present extensive experiments on four real world datasets cultivated to evaluate each of the specific challenges in place recognition. The results demonstrate that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling real-time performance. We confirm that networks trained for semantic place categorization also perform better at (specific) place recognition when faced with severe appearance changes and provide a reference for which networks and layers are optimal for different aspects of the place recognition problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353986.pdf","startPage":"4297","endPage":"4304","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of ConvNet features for place recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Robustness","Visualization","Real-time systems","Semantics","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","object recognition","optimisation","robot vision","search problems","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic place categorization","optimization technique","semantic search space partitioning","locality-sensitive hashing","condition-invariance","viewpoint-invariance","SLAM","visual navigation","robotic field","convolutional network","computer vision","place recognition","ConvNet feature"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of ConvNet features for place recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353986/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677823","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of ConvNet features for place recognition","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076876S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7353994,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenishbek Zhakypov","affiliation":["Authors are with Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Zhenishbek","lastName":"Zhakypov","id":"38667695300"},{"name":"Mohsen Falahi","affiliation":["Authors are with Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Falahi","id":"37085500341"},{"name":"Manan Shah","affiliation":["Authors are with Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Manan","lastName":"Shah","id":"37085665201"},{"name":"Jamie Paik","affiliation":["Authors are with Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jamie","lastName":"Paik","id":"37085372758"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7353994","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1306},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353994","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Fabrication","Three-dimensional displays","Foot","Actuators","Prototypes","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","gait analysis","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimodal locomotion origami robot control","multimodal locomotion origami robot design","Tribot robot","mobile origami robot","jumping locomotion","crawling locomotion","gait cycle","2D design","monolithic-layer- by-layer robogami fabrication method","multimaterial 3D printer","functional layer minimization","fabrication time reduction","embedded sensors","Tribot crawling gait pattern","Tribot jumping height","closed loop control","graphical design tool platform"]}],"abstract":"Origami robots (Robogamis) use architecture to strategically activate different sets and sequence of actuators to achieve large variety of reconfigurable forms.

To optimize the practicality of the nominally 2D design, we made two different approaches to build the prototypes. For one of them, we used the \u201ctraditional\u201d, monolithic, layer-by-layer robogami fabrication method and the second, we printed out most parts using a multi-material 3D printer. By showing the performance of two prototypes side-by-side, we show that with the 3D printer, we can minimize the number of functional layers and reduce the fabrication time. The embedded sensors allow Tribot's crawling gait pattern and jumping height to be modulated with a closed loop control. We compare the expected gait step size and displacement to that of the presented prototype while describing the design and control parameters to achieve the experimental results. We also illustrated the preliminary graphical design tool platform developed to optimize the next design iteration of Tribot.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353994","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353994.pdf","startPage":"4349","endPage":"4355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design and control of the multi-modal locomotion origami robot, Tribot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xploreNote":"As originally published there is an error in this document.

Despite a continuous technological advancement, many challenges are to be faced before establishing the use of these devices as part of the rehabilitation process. A main concern is how to actively engage the users and monitor how they are affected by the exoskeleton. Basic analyses, such as measuring walking speed, must be extended to include analysis on balance, brain activity, and evaluation of neuromechanical effects. This scenario requires the use of different distributed sensor devices that must be carefully synchronized. This work describes the architecture we implemented to extend the capabilities of the H2 exoskeleton. As a proof of the architecture validity, we show the online estimation of users' muscle forces through the acquisition of electromyographic signals, that drive neuromusculoskeletal models. The proposed framework, built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS), aims to be reusable for a wide range of setups, including different exoskeletons and sensors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible architecture to enhance wearable robots: Integration of EMG-informed models","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7353997","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07353997.pdf","startPage":"4368","endPage":"4374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7353997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7353997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"A flexible architecture to enhance wearable robots: Integration of EMG-informed models","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7353997/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667288","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible architecture to enhance wearable robots: Integration of EMG-informed models","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067583S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7353999,"authors":[{"name":"Cenk Baykal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Cenk","lastName":"Baykal","id":"37085438535"},{"name":"Luis G.

The component tubes of these robots can be swapped prior to performing a task in order to customize the robot's behavior and reachable workspace. Optimizing a robot's design by appropriately selecting tube parameters can improve the robot's effectiveness on a procedure- and patient-specific basis. In this paper, we present an algorithm that generates sets of concentric tube robot designs that can collectively maximize the reachable percentage of a given goal region in the human body. Our algorithm combines a search in the design space of a concentric tube robot using a global optimization method with a sampling-based motion planner in the robot's configuration space in order to find sets of designs that enable motions to goal regions while avoiding contact with anatomical obstacles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in a simulated scenario based on lung anatomy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7353999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7353999/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667173","pubMedId":"26951790","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing design parameters for sets of concentric tube robots using sampling-based motion planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing design parameters for sets of concentric tube robots using sampling-based motion planning","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"2098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08465S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7353999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7354004,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Varley","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore","Chair of Electromagnetic Theory, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Varley","id":"37085632898"},{"name":"Jonathan Weisz","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore","Chair of Electromagnetic Theory, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Weisz","id":"37945997600"},{"name":"Jared Weiss","firstName":"Jared","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37085612640"},{"name":"Peter Allen","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Allen","id":"37280851400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354004","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1327},"abstract":"This paper presents a deep learning architecture for detecting the palm and fingertip positions of stable grasps directly from partial object views.

The solution of this problem is derived by introducing a hierarchical decomposition of the game. On a superordinate collaboration level, the pursuers choose their optimal behavioral strategy (i.e. pursue and herd) resulting in a three-player non-cooperative dynamic game which is solved in a subordinate level of the overall game. This structure enables an intelligent behavior change for the pursuers based on game-theoretical solution methods. Depending on the state of the game it has to be evaluated which behavioral strategy yields the best results for the pursuers within the regarded time horizon. It is shown, that the pursuer's outcome can be improved by using a superordinate cooperation between them. Furthermore, this application was implemented on a real quad-rotor system. In experiments the quad-rotor teamed-up with a software-emulated pursuer and it was shown that another software-emulated quad-rotor was caught. This framework provides a solution concept for all types of dynamic games with an arbitrary number of players and teams having a non-cooperative and cooperative nature.

A novel and efficient fault detection and isolation approach is proposed for the total rotor failure case. An incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion approach is introduced to design the fault-tolerant controller for the quadrotor in the presence of the fault. The complete active fault-tolerant control system enables the quadrotor to achieve any position even after the complete loss of one rotor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07354046.pdf","startPage":"4698","endPage":"4703","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7354046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7354046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active fault-tolerant control for quadrotors subjected to a complete rotor failure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Actuators","Fault detection","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","fault tolerant control","helicopters","nonlinear control systems","rotors (mechanical)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrotors","total rotor failure","active fault-tolerant controller design","fault detection","fault isolation","incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Active fault-tolerant control for quadrotors subjected to a complete rotor failure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354046/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667463","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active fault-tolerant control for quadrotors subjected to a complete rotor failure","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065807S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7354046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354054,"authors":[{"name":"Daman Bareiss","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Utah"],"firstName":"Daman","lastName":"Bareiss","id":"37077603600"},{"name":"Jur van den Berg","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah"],"firstName":"Jur","lastName":"van den Berg","id":"37270739300"},{"name":"Kam K.

Collision detection and mitigation in the presence of uncertainty is an important problem to address because on-board sensing and state estimation uncertainties are inherent in real-world systems. A feedforward-based algorithm is described that continually extrapolates the future trajectory of the vehicle given the current operator control input for collision avoidance. If the predicted probability of a collision is greater than a user-defined confidence bound, the algorithm overrides the operator control input with the nearest, safe command signal to steer the robot away from obstacles, while maintaining user intent. The algorithm is implemented on a simulated quadrotor helicopter (quadcopter) with varying amounts of artificial uncertainty. Simulation results show that for a given confidence bound, the aerial robot is able to avoid collisions, even in a situation where the operator is deliberately attempting to crash the vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7354054","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07354054.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7354054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","startPage":"4818","endPage":"4825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic automatic collision avoidance for tele-operated unmanned aerial vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic automatic collision avoidance for tele-operated unmanned aerial vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354054/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667465","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7354054/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic automatic collision avoidance for tele-operated unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105431S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7354054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354090,"authors":[{"name":"Filipe Veiga","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Filipe","lastName":"Veiga","id":"37085670753"},{"name":"Herke van Hoof","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Herke","lastName":"van Hoof","id":"38541925500"},{"name":"Jan Peters","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Darmstadt Fachbereich Biologie, Darmstadt, Hessen, DE"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Peters"},{"name":"Tucker Hermans","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Tucker","lastName":"Hermans","id":"38230909600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354090","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Stability analysis","Tactile sensors","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","grippers","learning systems","pattern classification","random processes","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactile slip prediction","grasping","in-hand manipulation tasks","grip stability","slip detection","supervised learning methods","random forest classifiers","feedback loop","object stabilization controller"]}],"abstract":"During grasping and other in-hand manipulation tasks maintaining a stable grip on the object is crucial for the task's outcome. Inherently connected to grip stability is the concept of slip. Slip occurs when the contact between the fingertip and the object is partially lost, resulting in sudden undesired changes to the objects state. While several approaches for slip detection have been proposed in the literature, they frequently rely on previous knowledge of the manipulated object. This previous knowledge may be unavailable, seeing that robots operating in real-world scenarios often must interact with previously unseen objects. In our work we explore the generalization capabilities of well known supervised learning methods, using random forest classifiers to create generalizable slip predictors. We utilize these classifiers in the feedback loop of an object stabilization controller. We show that the controller can successfully stabilize previously unknown objects by predicting and counteracting slip events.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing novel objects by learning to predict tactile slip","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7354090","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07354090.pdf","startPage":"5065","endPage":"5072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7354090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing novel objects by learning to predict tactile slip","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354090/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15667138","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing novel objects by learning to predict tactile slip","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106874S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7354090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7354211,"authors":[{"name":"Bokman Lim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea"],"firstName":"Bokman","lastName":"Lim","id":"38252097700"},{"name":"Kyungrock Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea"],"lastName":"Kyungrock Kim","id":"38543062400"},{"name":"Jusuk Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea"],"lastName":"Jusuk Lee","id":"38252493200"},{"name":"Junwon Jang","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea"],"lastName":"Junwon Jang","id":"38542684000"},{"name":"Youngbo Shim","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea"],"lastName":"Youngbo Shim","id":"37278689900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354211","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":359},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An event-driven control to achieve adaptive walking assist with gait primitives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Hip","Knee","Torque","Trajectory","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial limbs","estimation theory","finite state machines","gait analysis","interpolation","medical robotics","motion control","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health care","motion interpolation","moment estimation","joint motion trajectory","motion reconstruction method","finite state machine","walking motion","hip-mounted exoskeleton robot","gait primitive","adaptive walking assist","event-driven control"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a control method for walking assist with hip-mounted exoskeleton robots. For modeling a user's current walking motion, a novel finite state machine is first constructed. We divide a walking cycle uniformly using the inevitable zero crossing events. When state transitions occur, we capture the current walking spatio-temporal sensor data as discrete form. By using the sensed hip data as boundary conditions, we also develop a gait primitives based motion reconstruction method. Gait primitives are a form of basis trajectories to represent various joint motions. From those methods we estimate the moment of heel landing with interpolated knee joint motions. Utilizing the user's previous opposite step motion, we predict the positive or negative work intervals of the current step motion. This makes it possible to achieve natural `one shot' assist by driving adapted torques fast. This assist strategy is also effective to enhance gait regularity. The measures of stride time variability are improved by over 30% for the simulated experiment. Various real experimentations demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2015.7354211","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347169/7353104/07354211.pdf","startPage":"5870","endPage":"5875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2015.7354211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354211/","displayDocTitle":"An event-driven control to achieve adaptive walking assist with gait primitives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15677808","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354211/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event-driven control to achieve adaptive walking assist with gait primitives","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073042S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347169","isNumber":"7353104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347169","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7353104","articleId":"7354211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7354252,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Ishiki","affiliation":["Kumamoto Daigaku, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, JP"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Ishiki"},{"name":"Makoto Kumon","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Chuoku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Kumon","id":"37296098600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9994-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9993-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354252","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":265},"abstract":"Unmanned multirotor helicopters have been expected for various critical tasks such as rescue missions, and it is important to sense the environment to achieve those tasks. In order to realize such sensor systems, this paper considers acoustic information recognition from a hovering helicopter which a microphone array system. As the noise of rotors distorts the acoustic information, noise reduction is necessary. Since the rotor noise varies even at the hovering flight, an acoustic model of the rotor noise is derived taking the dynamics of the helicopter into account, and the model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the microphone array. The proposed approach was verified by evaluating the optimality of a real device that was empirically tuned in authors previous work, and the computed configuration of the microphone array and the developed one coincide well, which ensures the validity of the approach. As the validation through a practical application, the signal was processed by Delay-and-Sum Beam Former to localize the sound source.

This walking pattern can be described by a cyclic motion, which can be modeled using the consecutive gait phases. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for analyzing and recognizing a pathological human walking gait pattern. Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to detect and track the human legs, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait patterns. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different elderly persons with a number of pathologies. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed human data analysis scheme has the potential to provide the necessary methodological (modeling, inference, and learning) framework for a cognitive behavior-based robot control system.

The optimal bang-bang control law uses a maximum stiffness when the link gets away from the desired position, i.e. the link velocity is decreasing, and a minimum one when the link is going towards it, i.e. the link velocity is increasing.

By utilizing the complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) in the time domain and exploiting the channel sparsity in the delay domain, we obtain a joint-block-sparse model.

In this paper, we present a new approach, called block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) over real field, to obtain diversity which increases the transmission reliability under the fading channels. The proposed scheme is similar to BMST over binary field, which has been used to construct big convolutional codes from short codes. However, unlike superposition in BMST over binary field, superposition in the proposed scheme is over real field. We also present an iterative sliding-window detection/decoding algorithm for the proposed transmission scheme. The performance of BMST over real field can be lower bounded by that of the equivalent system.

The users onboard the train communicate with the ground base station (BS) via MR, i.e. two-hop communications. The distributed antenna system (DAS) is used on ground, where a BS consists of a central unit (CU) and a number of remote antenna units (RAUs) connecting to the CU by optical fiber. The issue of selecting an optimal cooperative RAU set of a linear DAS for railway scenario is addressed. We present a low complexity approach to select a transmit RAU set for capacity maximization, based on the theory of convex optimization. We show via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations that the proposed algorithm provides performance very close to that of optimal selection based on exhaustive search.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal selection of cooperative RAUs in HSR based distributed antenna systems and mobile relay with massive antennas","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","doi":"10.1109/HMWC.2015.7354339","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7323433/7353339/07354339.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HMWC.2015.7354339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal selection of cooperative RAUs in HSR based distributed antenna systems and mobile relay with massive antennas","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354339/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663909","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal selection of cooperative RAUs in HSR based distributed antenna systems and mobile relay with massive antennas","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1570209957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143213S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7323433","isNumber":"7353339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7323433","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7353339","articleId":"7354339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354342,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoxiang Yang","id":"37085752498"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoyang Zhang","id":"37279636300"},{"name":"Panyu Fu","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Panyu Fu","id":"37085526269"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jing Zhang","id":"37085674279"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7629-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7628-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354342","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"abstract":"Recently, a scheme called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with Generalized Index Modulation (OFDM-GIM) is proposed, in which the number of active subcarriers in an OFDM sub-block is adjustable and a higher spectral efficiency is achieved compared with the conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation(OFDM-IM) scheme. In this paper, based on the general index modulation structure, a spectrum-efficient Index Modulation with Improved Mapping is proposed. In this scheme, each sub-block can use different constellation mappings as well as different numbers of active subcarriers to transmit information. We further propose the corresponding transmitter and the receiver structures. The simulation results show that the proposed system achieves a higher spectrum efficiency and better BER performance compared with the existing OFDM-IM schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7323433/7353339/07354342.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","doi":"10.1109/HMWC.2015.7354342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HMWC.2015.7354342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum-efficient Index Modulation with Improved constellation Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","OFDM","Transmitters","Receivers","Fading","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum-efficient index modulation","improved constellation mapping","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with generalized index modulation","OFDM-GIM","transmitter","receiver","BER performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-efficient Index Modulation with Improved constellation Mapping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354342/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663900","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-efficient Index Modulation with Improved constellation Mapping","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1570210887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057061S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7323433","isNumber":"7353339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7323433","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7353339","articleId":"7354342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354343,"authors":[{"name":"Dian Fan","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Dian Fan","id":"37087643568"},{"name":"Zhangdui Zhong","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangdui","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37287974400"},{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Gongpu Wang","id":"37087145696"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Feifei Gao","id":"37087199581"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7629-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7628-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354343","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":590},"abstract":"This paper investigates the Doppler shift estimation problem for high speed railway (HSR) wireless communication systems with massive linear receiving antennas.

The relay harvests energy from the received radio-frequency (RF) signals transmitted from the two sources and then use it to forward the received signals. For such a system, we study the power splitting-based two-way relay (PS-TWR) transmission strategy and analytically derive an explicit expression of the system outage probability. In order to explore the system outage performance limit, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the system outage probability by jointly optimizing the power splitting ratio and the time assignment ratio. Since the problem is non-convex and have no known solution method, we present a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve it. Numerical results demonstrate our theoretical analysis and show that the power splitting ratio and the time assignment ratio greatly affect the system outage performance. Moreover, it is also shown that for the SWIPT-enabled two-way relay system, the relay node should be deployed closer to the source with better channel quality and when it is positioned on the middle point between the two sources, the system gets the worst outage performance, which is very different from traditional non-SWIPT two-way relay systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7323433/7353339/07354345.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications (HMWC)","doi":"10.1109/HMWC.2015.7354345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HMWC.2015.7354345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7353339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage performance of SWIPT-enabled two-way relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receivers","Wireless communication","Energy harvesting","Radio frequency","Optimization","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","genetic algorithms","network coding","probability","radiofrequency power transmission","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-way relay networks","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","SWIPT","two-way relay channels","energy harvesting relay","digital network coding","radiofrequency signals","power splitting-based two-way relay transmission","PS-TWR transmission","outage probability","power splitting ratio","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","wireless information and power transfer","two-way relay","outage performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Outage performance of SWIPT-enabled two-way relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15663920","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage performance of SWIPT-enabled two-way relay networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1570213109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063191S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7323433","isNumber":"7353339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7323433","xplore-issue":"7353339","articleId":"7354345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354346,"authors":[{"name":"Hengzhou Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, P.

Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product tau of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sub linear dependence on tau.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352273/7354373/07354428.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"809","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2015.54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2015.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hamiltonian Simulation with Nearly Optimal Dependence on all Parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Quantum computing","Computational modeling","Hilbert space","Computer science","Heuristic algorithms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bessel functions","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse Hamiltonian simulation","near-optimal scaling","quantum walk","fractional-query simulation","Bessel function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hamiltonian simulation","quantum algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hamiltonian Simulation with Nearly Optimal Dependence on all Parameters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354428/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668723","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hamiltonian Simulation with Nearly Optimal Dependence on all Parameters","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8191a792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082488S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7352273","isNumber":"7354373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7352273","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7354373","articleId":"7354428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7354429,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Leverrier","affiliation":["Inria, Le Chesnay, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Leverrier"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Tillich","affiliation":["EPI SECRET, Inria, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Tillich","id":"37283351500"},{"name":"Gilles Z\u00e9mor","affiliation":["Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Bordeaux, UMR 5251, France","Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Bordeaux, UMR 5251, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Z\u00e9mor","id":"37283322300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8191-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"7354429","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354429","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Graph theory","Quantum computing","Iterative decoding","Robustness","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","graph theory","parity check codes","quantum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant rate quantum hypergraph-product LDPC expander code","weight proportional error correction code","linear-time decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Expander codes","LDPC codes","quantum codes","CSS codes"]}],"abstract":"We present an efficient decoding algorithm for constant rate quantum hyper graph-product LDPC codes which provably corrects adversarial errors of weight proportional to the code minimum distance, or equivalently to the square-root of the block length.

We prove that if p > C n log4 n, then with probability 1-o(1), |XT v|1 is close to its expectation for all vectors v in Rn (simultaneously). The bound on p is sharp up to the polylogarithmic factor. The study of this problem is directly motivated by an application. Let A be an n by n matrix, X be an n by p matrix and Y = AX. A challenging and important problem in data analysis, motivated by dictionary learning and other practical problems, is to recover both A and X, given Y. Under normal circumstances, it is clear that this problem is underdetermined. However, in the case when X is sparse and random, Spiel man, Wang and Wright showed that one can recover both A and X efficiently from Y with high probability, given that p (the number of samples) is sufficiently large. Their method works for p > C n2 log2 n and they conjectured that p > C n log n suffices. The bound n log n is sharp for an obvious information theoretical reason. The matrix concentration result verifies the Spiel man et. Al. Conjecture up to a log3 n factor. Our proof of the concentration result is based on two ideas. The first is an economical way to apply the union bound. The second is a refined version of Bernstein's concentration inequality for a sum of independent variables. Both have nothing to do with random matrices and are applicable in general settings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Dictionaries","Yttrium","Linear matrix inequalities","Random variables","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mathematics computing","optimisation","probability","random processes","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["l1 concentration","dictionary learning","sparse random matrix","probability","polylogarithmic factor","data analysis","matrix concentration","log3 n factor","union bound","concentration inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dictionary Learning","Matrix Concentration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2015.90","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352273/7354373/07354464.pdf","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2015.90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Matrices: l1 Concentration and Dictionary Learning with Few Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random Matrices: l1 Concentration and Dictionary Learning with Few Samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354464/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354464/","accessionNumber":"15668732","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Matrices: l1 Concentration and Dictionary Learning with Few Samples","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"8191b409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080004S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7352273","isNumber":"7354373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7352273","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7354373","articleId":"7354464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7354498,"authors":[{"name":"Andrijana Popovska Avramova","affiliation":["Department of Photonics Engineering Technical, University of Denmark, Kgs.

The performance of single channel CO-OFDM and with 10GHz channels pacing at 10-Gb/s data rate is shown through the optisystem for different modulation schemes and different fiber lengths at different receiving power levels. The experimented results have been achieved over 100km, 400km, 600km and 1000 km distances to study the effect of power consumption at the receiver end with different modulation schemes. In short distance PAM performs quite well and 16 QAM has worst results. In long distance OOK obtain the highest receive power and high order QAM receive the lowest power for the same distance. In middle range 600km, OOK is better and 128QAM has high loss 16QAM & PAM was almost same performance. To increase BER performance of M-QAM, amplifier power should increase trade off but noise level and signal quality also has to maintain. Furthermore, the simulation results expose that the transmission length increased and also the receive power level decreased for fiber attenuation, dispersion and low power of the laser. The results show the relationship of transmission distance and receive power level, and between bit error rate and optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient modulation technique on 10Gb/s coherent detection optical OFDM","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354551","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354551.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient modulation technique on 10Gb/s coherent detection optical OFDM","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354551/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665108","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient modulation technique on 10Gb/s coherent detection optical OFDM","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058346S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354553,"authors":[{"name":"Youngwook Ko","affiliation":["Electri.

Although a receiver is able to exploit a power gain with precoding in OFDM, the sensitivity of the signal detection is usually high as the orthogonality is not retained in highly dispersive environments. To overcome this, we focus on developing the trade-off between the sparsity of the MCIK, correlation, and performances, analyzing the average probability of the error propagation imposed by incorrect index detection over highly correlated sub-carriers. In asymptotic cases, we are able to see how sparsity of MCIK should be designed in order to perform superior to the classical OFDM system. Based on this feature, sparse MCIK based OFDM is a better choice for low detection errors in highly correlated sub-carriers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse multi-carrier index keying OFDM with index separation over correlated sub-carriers","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354553","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354553.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sparse multi-carrier index keying OFDM with index separation over correlated sub-carriers","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354553/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse multi-carrier index keying OFDM with index separation over correlated sub-carriers","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076285S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354554,"authors":[{"name":"Sooyoung Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Eng, Chonbuk National University Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279282600"},{"name":"Saleem Ahmed","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Eng, Chonbuk National University Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Saleem","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38581275600"},{"name":"Meixiang Zhang","affiliation":["Division of Electronics Eng, Chonbuk National University Jeonju, Korea"],"firstName":"Meixiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240488900"},{"name":"F.

It is well known that in a single user case the capacity scales linearly with the minimum number of transmit and receive antennas. Many linear precoding techniques require each antenna to transmit its own data. In this paper, we analyze the latest technology of MIMO with theoretic background. We compare the increasing features of capacity by using two precoding methods based on spatial multiplexed system. We apply two precodings to multiple antennas, considering MU-MIMO downlink. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates how the number of antennas has an effect on capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354573","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354573.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","startPage":"405","endPage":"407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of precoding for MU-MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of precoding for MU-MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354573/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665174","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7354573/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of precoding for MU-MIMO systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042005S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354579,"authors":[{"name":"Kensaku Tamayama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensaku","lastName":"Tamayama","id":"37085657939"},{"name":"Mai Ohta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Ohta","id":"37085359084"},{"name":"Makoto Taromaru","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Taromaru","id":"37085360838"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354579","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Cognitive radio","Detectors","Estimation","OFDM","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fast Fourier transforms","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal bandwidth estimation","energy detector","windowed FFT","cognitive radio system","windowed fast Fourier transform","spectrum sensing","received time domain signal","received signal frequency","probability","energy leakage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio system","spectrum sensing","energy detection","windowed FFT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354579","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354579","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","abstract":"We evaluate an estimation scheme of unknown signal's bandwidth estimation with an energy detector based on a windowed fast Fourier transform (FFT) for cognitive radio system.

In vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicle tracking is achieved by broadcasting beacon containing state information of the sending vehicle in dedicated short range communication (DSRC) channel. Frequent beacon broadcasting can enhance vehicle tracking accuracy, but also lead to channel congestion in high vehicle density. The state-of-the-art beaconing schemes adapt beacon rate to avoid channel congestion. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of event-driven traffic on the tracking accuracy of beaconing schemes. The simulation results show that tracking accuracy degrades with the increase of event-driven traffic load. Based on the results, we conclude that beacon rate should be carefully determined in order to maintain the tracking accuracy with the existence of event-driven traffic load.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354603","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354603.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354603","startPage":"530","endPage":"532","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the tracking accuracy of beaconing coexistent with event-driven traffic at the DSRC channel","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7354603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15664996","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the tracking accuracy of beaconing coexistent with event-driven traffic at the DSRC channel","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039263S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354607,"authors":[{"name":"Seongyong Jeong","affiliation":["Network Research Lab, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seongyong","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37085737826"},{"name":"Heejun Roh","affiliation":["Network Research Lab, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Heejun","lastName":"Roh","id":"37409435800"},{"name":"Wonjun Lee","affiliation":["Network Research Lab, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37291456100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354607","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"abstract":"Although downlink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology is included in the IEEE 802.11ac Standard, multi-cell interference in IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO networks degrades expected performance gain from the technology due to unplanned deployment of access points. To this end, recent research efforts envision that a central controller coordinates a set of APs to alleviate the multi-cell interference. However, to fully exploit the benefits of the coordinated access points with MU-MIMO, it is essential that clients should be carefully selected to maximize aggregate throughput. While an exhaustive search gives the optimal solution, its computationally infeasibility in large size networks requires another solution. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate a client selection problem for coordinated access points and suggest a polynomial time algorithm. Evaluation results show that our algorithm achieves about 98 % of the optimal aggregate throughput with a moderate computational overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354607.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"553","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Client selection for coordinated IEEE 802.11ac multi-user MIMO-enabled access points","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Aggregates","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis","MIMO","Downlink","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","centralised control","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","polynomials","radiofrequency interference","search problems","telecommunication control","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational overhead","polynomial time algorithm","coordinated access points","client selection problem","central controller coordinates","IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO networks","multicell interference","MU-MIMO technology","downlink multiuser MIMO technology","multiuser MIMO-enabled access points","coordinated IEEE 802.11ac"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-user MIMO","coordinated access points","the Hungarian algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Client selection for coordinated IEEE 802.11ac multi-user MIMO-enabled access points","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354607/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665225","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Client selection for coordinated IEEE 802.11ac multi-user MIMO-enabled access points","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052894S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354634,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung Min Chang","affiliation":["School of electronic engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Min","lastName":"Chang","id":"38252934200"},{"name":"Joo Pyoung Choi","affiliation":["School of electronic engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Joo Pyoung","lastName":"Choi","id":"38259370000"},{"name":"Won Cheol Lee","affiliation":["School of electronic engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Won Cheol","lastName":"Lee","id":"37335553500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354634","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a modified method to calculate the maximum permitted effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of a TV band device (TVBD) using location probability with a selective lognormal power sum algorithm to reduce approximation errors.

However, the performance of such systems can be degraded by various factors e.g. imperfect sensing, non-accurate result reporting of the sensed spectrum either due to error-prone reporting channel (RC) or malicious user attack. Moreover the phenomena of reporting only from those cognitive users (CUs) whom RC is above a pre-defined threshold, can help in improving the throughput for the cognitive radio system (CRS). In this paper a detailed study of the aforementioned reporting mechanism with respect to sensing efficiency has been formulated to analyze the impact on CRS performance. Furthermore, to filter the inaccurate information which tends to increase the miss detection probability we propose an effective cooperative spectrum sensing (ECSS) algorithm via a two-level eligibility cooperating criteria. Simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15665051","htmlLink":"/document/7354641/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Threshold based reporting for improving sensing efficiency in cognitive radio systems with multiple cognitive users","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold based reporting for improving sensing efficiency in cognitive radio systems with multiple cognitive users","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061188S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354642,"authors":[{"name":"Zafar Iqbal","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Zafar","lastName":"Iqbal","id":"37085513322"},{"name":"Heung-No Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-No","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280118100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354642","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","OFDM","Sea surface","Underwater acoustics","Relays","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","network coding","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","sensor placement","underwater acoustic communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deployment strategy analysis","underwater cooperative wireless sensor networks","underwater environment monitoring","cooperative coded OFDM system","COFDM system","network coding","shadowing phenomenon","underwater communication channel","cooperative spatial domain coding","LDPC coded OFDM system","random deployment strategy","grid deployment strategy","bit-error rate","network cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Deployment","Underwater communication","LDPC","OFDM","Network coding","UWSN"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment strategy analysis for underwater cooperative wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354642","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354642","startPage":"699","endPage":"703","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354642.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used for underwater environment monitoring.

Lately, Digital signage technology has become one of the most flourished industry for ISC technology as it has uncovered a lot of opportunities such as interactivity, dynamic content provisioning and so on. Granting all this opportuneness, there are some major issues in the case of ISC technology when the communication system specifies the communication by means of steganography process (Inserting data in the video image). Geometric and photometric transformations of the image are among them while the display and the camera act as a transmitter and a receiver in ISC, respectively. Due to this effect, the data can be changed or noise can be even more influential than the required signal. To achieve a relevant communication method, the influence of these transformational issues need to be taken into care. We proposed a mathematical modeling to figure out the photometric effects created by illumination from the light source of the environment in this paper. The channel model is used as non-Lambertian model. The novelty of this work implies the unification of computer vision and proposed channel model to remove the photometric transformational effects due to illumination in an image.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354668","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354668.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical modeling for calibrating illuminated image in image sensor communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354668/","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical modeling for calibrating illuminated image in image sensor communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665084","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354668/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical modeling for calibrating illuminated image in image sensor communication","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075538S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354680,"authors":[{"name":"Hamza Khan","affiliation":["The School of Information and Communication Engineering Inha University Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":"Khan","id":"37085675479"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["The School of Information and Communication Engineering Inha University Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354680","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Additives","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","genetic algorithms","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active interference restriction","OFDM-based cognitive radio network","genetic algorithm","interference minimization","primary user","secondary user leakage emission","additive signal side-lobe reduction technique","CR-OFDM system","out-of-band signal interference","OOB signal interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radios","Interference Reduction","Genetic Algorithm","OFDM","Sidelobe Suppression"]}],"abstract":"In OFDM based cognitive radio networks, minimizing the interference caused to the primary user (PU) by the leakage emission of secondary users (SUs) is a great challenge. In this paper, we propose an interference restriction scheme using the additive signal side-lobe reduction technique and genetic algorithm (GA) in CR-OFDM systems. Additive signal side-lobe reduction technique is based on adding a complex array to modulated data symbols in the constellation plane for sidelobe reduction in OFDM system. In the proposed method, GA generates optimum additive signal which can effectively reduce the SU out-of-band (OOB) signal interference and consequently strives to keep the interference below a tolerable limit pre-defined by PU. The results show that the side-lobes of the OFDM-based SU signal can be reduced by up to 35dB and the PU interference tolerable limit can be satisfied.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354680","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354680.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active interference restriction in OFDM-based cognitive radio network using genetic algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354680/","displayDocTitle":"Active interference restriction in OFDM-based cognitive radio network using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665275","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354680/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active interference restriction in OFDM-based cognitive radio network using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068151S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354688,"authors":[{"name":"Donghun Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)"],"firstName":"Donghun","lastName":"Lee","id":"38067151900"},{"name":"Seungkeun Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)"],"firstName":"Seungkeun","lastName":"Park","id":"38240788000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354688","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354688","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Nakagami distribution","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Block codes","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","Nakagami channels","phase shift keying","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time block codes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block code asymptotic analysis","spatially correlated Nakagami fading channel","multiple input multiple output system","MIMO system","signal to noise ratio","diversity order","SNR gain","outage probability","symbol error rate","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","phase shift keying modulation","PSK modulation","STBC-based MIMO system","SER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time block codes (STBC)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","symbol error rate (SER)","spatially correlated channels","spatial diversity (SD)","diversity order","signal to noise ratio (SNR) gain"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we studies the asymptotic analysis of space-time block codes (STBC) over spatially correlated Nakagami fading channels for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

This technology can achieve multi user MIMO (MU-MIMO) of high magnitude via the provision of simultaneous data transmission to large number of user equipments (UEs) in the network. It is quite clear that shifting from the conventional MIMO to FD-MIMO would require a change in base station designs, but the question remains; which designs provide the optimal performance? In this paper, we present results from a study of the impact of angular spread on throughput for a planar array system. By means of simulations, evaluations are performed to aid the understanding of antenna configuration for optimal performance. In order to demonstrate the potential performance benefits of FD-MIMO, simulations were performed with a detailed dynamic simulator which includes a 3-Dimensional Spatial Channel Model (3D SCM). Our results show that a square grid planar array with higher elevation angular spread can provide vast improvements in terms of throughput gain over conventional horizontal linear configuration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354729/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15665062","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354729/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Full dimension MIMO antenna configuration for optimal performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full dimension MIMO antenna configuration for optimal performance","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061689S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354750,"authors":[{"name":"Bong-Su Kim","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Bong-Su","lastName":"Kim","id":"37402021100"},{"name":"Min-Soo Kang","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Soo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37271700600"},{"name":"Kwang-Seon Kim","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang-Seon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085707376"},{"name":"Woo-Jin Byun","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Jin","lastName":"Byun","id":"37296488300"},{"name":"Myung-Sun Song","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Sun","lastName":"Song","id":"37085695407"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354750","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication","Antenna measurements","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna beam pattern","fixed wireless access","line-of-sight multiple input multiple output system","LoS MIMO system","amplitude mismatch effect analysis","frequency 18 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LoS-MIMO","18 GHz","SIR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an 18 GHz 2 \u00d7 2 line-of-sight (LoS) multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) system for fixed wireless access is presented.

In this paper, an optimal spectrum sensing is depicted to achieve the feature: (I)to determine the value of the capacity of the Cognitive Radio Users in the network; (II) to determine the optimal transmission time of each CR user. First, closed-form expressions for the capacity of the Cognitive Radio users and the optimal transmission time of each CR user are derived for a general PU mobility model. Then, the expressions are applied to a widely used model, i.e., the Random Walk mobility model. Finally, the analytical results are verified through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354784","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354784.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354784","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal primary-user mobility aware parameters design of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal primary-user mobility aware parameters design of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354784/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354784/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665170","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal primary-user mobility aware parameters design of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071011S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354789,"authors":[{"name":"Wanhee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mobile Communication & Digital Broadcasting Engineering, UST (University of Science & Technology), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Wanhee","lastName":"Kim","id":"38238901300"},{"name":"JungSook Bae","affiliation":["ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Daejcon, Korea"],"firstName":"JungSook","lastName":"Bae","id":"37960976000"},{"name":"Sook-Jin Lee","affiliation":["ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Daejcon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sook-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407212400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354789","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":804},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Azimuth","Channel models","Array signal processing","Fitting","5G mobile communication","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","array signal processing","cellular radio","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain degradation effect","beam misalignment","5G cellular communication","millimeter wave technology","5G network","path loss characteristics","mmWave system","beamforming technique","mmWave beamforming system","channel coefficients","QuaDRiGa channel model implementation","channel gain analysis","BS beam","channel gain degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mmWave","beamforming","beam misalignment","5G"]}],"abstract":"Millimeter wave technology is major candidate technology for 5G network.

In the beamforming game, each transmitter (a player) tries to maximize the achievable rate (a payoff function) via a proper beamforming strategy. With the perfect CSI, each transmitter can know the exact achievable rate region, and hence can find the beamforming strategy corresponding to any point in the achievable rate region. With limited feedback, however, the transmitters can only conjecture the achievable rate region from the quantized CSI, so their optimal strategies may not be optimal anymore. Considering the quantized CSI at the transmitter, we first find the Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game. Then, we consider a cooperative game and modify the Nash bargaining solution.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354802","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354802.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354802","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming games with quantized CSI in two-user interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming games with quantized CSI in two-user interference channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354802/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665088","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming games with quantized CSI in two-user interference channels","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"W12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093158S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354808,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungkook Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungkook","lastName":"Oh","id":"37085565546"},{"name":"Haewoon Nam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea"],"firstName":"Haewoon","lastName":"Nam","id":"37410378600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354808","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon","Binary phase shift keying","Degradation","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulse noise","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinearity design","quadratic amplitude modulation","impulsive noise environment","nonGaussian noise","transmitted signal detection","binary phase shift keying system","BPSK system","QAM system","optimal receiver"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354808","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354808.pdf","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of non-linearity about quadratic amplitude modulation in an impulsive noise environment","abstract":"From many electronics, an unexpected noise is generated. An impulsive noise or non-Gaussian noise has been announced as appropriate model for abrupt strong interference, now that the noise is observed as impulsive property. Founded on these models, many researchers have tried to find a solution to prevent a performance degradation, because the impulsive noise severely interferes with detecting a transmitted signal. Non-linearities are used so that the overall system guarantees low complexity and little performance degradation. Designs of non-linearity are considerably proceeded about binary phase shift keying (BPSK) system. However, a non-linearity for quadratic amplitude modulation (QAM) system has been researched. Since a constellation of QAM is different to that of BPSK, non-linearity to be designed for BPSK has been not inefficient to reduce performance degradation. Therefore, this paper proposes non-linearity for QAM system in impulsive noise. The proposed non-linearities include non-linearities of hard-limiter and blanker that offer simple calculation of thresholds of non-linearities. Besides, due to the fact that non-linearity of optimal receiver is transformed as a certain signal power, simple calculation of switching threshold to choose non-linearities is proposed. Simulation results show that there is little performance degradation of the proposed scheme when comparing with performance of optimal receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7354808/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665124","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of non-linearity about quadratic amplitude modulation in an impulsive noise environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of non-linearity about quadratic amplitude modulation in an impulsive noise environment","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"W22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04903S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354809,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Hwa Jeong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Hwa","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37085647415"},{"name":"Tae-Jun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Jun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085648164"},{"name":"Myung-Jin Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085634092"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354809","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Standards","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","phase noise","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-error rate performance","MIMO-OFDM systems","IEEE 802.11ad standards","independent phase noise","coherent phase noise","common local oscillators","transmit antennas","receive antennas","multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11ad standards","multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM)","phase noise","common/independent oscillators"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we show the effect of phase noise on the bit-error rate performance in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems based on IEEE 802.11ad standards.

business. Since femtocells are likely to be deployed by subscribers individually, we can expect the most of femtocells will be operating as the closed access mode that allows the only authorized users or owners to access the femtocell. Although a lot of femtocells are able to provide the network access covering a large area, they are only used by their owners in the deployed place. This paper addresses the inefficient femtocell operation and proposes a new access mode for femtocells which is called Give-And-Take (GAT) mode. This mode encourages users to share their femtocell access points, and resolve the femtocell inefficiency resulting from the closed access mode. This paper shows that GTA mode can be a feasible solution to improve the femtocell efficiency through a game theory model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new access mode for femtocells in 5G networks","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354817","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7337634/7354472/07354817.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7354817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7354817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A new access mode for femtocells in 5G networks","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7354817/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15664967","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new access mode for femtocells in 5G networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"W35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053764S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7337634","isNumber":"7354472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7337634","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7354472","articleId":"7354817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7354818,"authors":[{"name":"Nam-Tuan Le","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Nam-Tuan","lastName":"Le","id":"37717923700"},{"name":"M.A. Hossain","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37085449838"},{"name":"Chang Hyun Hong","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seongbok-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Chang Hyun","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085442050"},{"name":"Trang Nguyen","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Trang","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085559472"},{"name":"Thithanhnhan Le","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Thithanhnhan","lastName":"Le","id":"37085713070"},{"name":"Yeong Min Jang","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seongbok-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Yeong Min","lastName":"Jang","id":"37536259400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7116-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7115-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7354818","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Optical transmitters","MIMO","Light emitting diodes","Modulation","Image sensors","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blur Gaussian","MIMO optical camera communications","RF communication system","visible light communication standard","optical channel","MIMO OCC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera comunication","Optical camera communication","OCC","OWC","MIMO","Blur Gaussian"]}],"abstract":"MIMO is popular technique which can improve the reliability and spectral efficiency of RF communication system by using the spatial link dimensions. It is also an attractive option solution for achieving high data rate. Optical Camera Communication (OCC) is considered for revision specification of visible light communication standard. One of the most consideration disadvantages of OCC is data rate limitation. With traditional modulation scheme, the throughput can achieve a few bits per second. MIMO is promising technique to overcome this limitation. Independent streams of light transmitter array will be sent over optical channel and decoded over a group of camera pixels. However with the effect of blur, two transmit element images may not be resolvable by overlap pixels.

Currently, the thermo-crimping technique is commonly used, because it combines high process stability with short tact times. However, the thermo-crimping tools show strong wearing within short periods, as the required heat to skin the insulated copper wires has to be supplied from the electrodes themselves. Therefore, the electrode materials have to face simultaneously high pressures and temperatures up to 650\u00b0C, resulting in highly frequent setup processes and corresponding costs. For this reason, a new technique to join insulated copper wires with cable lugs, based on the ultrasonic welding procedure, was investigated at the department FAPS. The following paper describes the explored results regarding the technique of ultrasonic welding. Hereby, the new technology is compared with the thermo-crimping process concerning the joint quality, tact time and tool wearing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355088/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355088/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667665","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaption of the ultrasonic welding technique to the process of joining insulated copper wires with standardized tubular cable lugs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaption of the ultrasonic welding technique to the process of joining insulated copper wires with standardized tubular cable lugs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039114S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347717","isNumber":"7354938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347717","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7354938","articleId":"7355088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7355089,"authors":[{"name":"Koichiro Sawa","affiliation":["Standardization Committee on DC High Voltage Relays Nippon Electric Control Equipment Industries Association (NECA)"],"firstName":"Koichiro","lastName":"Sawa","id":"38481238700"},{"name":"Shigeru Tsujimura","affiliation":["Standardization Committee on DC High Voltage Relays Nippon Electric Control Equipment Industries Association (NECA)"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Tsujimura","id":"37085689811"},{"name":"Shigeki Motoda","affiliation":["Standardization Committee on DC High Voltage Relays Nippon Electric Control Equipment Industries Association (NECA)"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Motoda","id":"37085683279"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9341-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9340-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7355089","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":161},"abstract":"As various DC power supply systems such as photovoltaic power generation, fuel cell and others have become gradually popular, DC current interruption is one of the key technologies for reliability and safety of DC switching devices. In a previous paper a model switch is developed with magnetic blow-out of three levels, and gap length and arc length at arc extinction are obtained by a high-speed camera in range of current less than 4 A and voltage lower than 500V. The gap length and arc length at extinction are much shorter than those without magnetic blow-out.In this paper the interrupted current is expanded to 30A and source voltage is 100, 300 and 500V. The results are compared with previous ones and the followings can be made clear. The gap width at arc extinction is almost independent of interrupted current and source voltage. Those gap width is 0.8, 0.3 and 0.2 mm for magnetic flux densities 19, 53 and 157mT, respectively, and in accordance with the previous values. On the other hand, the arc length becomes longer with interrupted current / source voltage. The maximum length reaches about 60 mm at 500V and 30A for19mT. In addition the change of arc length with time is discussed and the process is found to consist of slow rising and rapid rising intervals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 61st Holm Conference on Electrical Contacts (Holm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347717/7354938/07355089.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 61st Holm Conference on Electrical Contacts (Holm)","doi":"10.1109/HOLM.2015.7355089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOLM.2015.7355089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7354938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental characteristics of arc extinction by magnetic blow-out at DC voltages (<500V) II","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic flux density","Magnetic separation","Switches","Contacts","Interrupters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit-breaking arcs","power supply circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arc extinction","magnetic blow-out","DC power supply system","DC current interruption","DC switching device safety","DC switching device reliability","gap length","arc length","high-speed camera","interrupted current","gap width","source voltage","voltage 100 V to 500 V","size 0.8 mm to 0.2 mm","current 30 A","magnetic flux density 19 mT to 157 mT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC interruption arc discharge","magnetic blow-out","gap witdth at arcextinction","arc length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental characteristics of arc extinction by magnetic blow-out at DC voltages (<500V) II","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355089/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667678","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental characteristics of arc extinction by magnetic blow-out at DC voltages (<500V) II","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"05174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077357S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347717","isNumber":"7354938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347717","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7354938","articleId":"7355089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7355197,"authors":[{"name":"Cornel Stanescu","affiliation":["Standard Products Group ON Semiconductor Romania S.R.L., Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cornel","lastName":"Stanescu","id":"37363212800"},{"name":"Cristian Dinca","affiliation":["Standard Products Group ON Semiconductor Romania S.R.L., Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Dinca","id":"37594330900"},{"name":"Andrei Sevcenco","affiliation":["Standard Products Group ON Semiconductor Romania S.R.L., Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Sevcenco","id":"37658815900"},{"name":"Radu Iacob","affiliation":["Standard Products Group ON Semiconductor Corp., Santa Clara, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Iacob","id":"37594319200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8863-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8862-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-827X"}],"articleNumber":"7355197","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":425},"abstract":"The paper presents three approaches for frequency compensation in chopper offset-stabilized amplifiers with symmetrical passive RC notch filter with two cutoff frequencies.

Thus, the figures-of-merit related to the EA gain-bandwidth and slew-rate are 2.75, respectively 24 times better than for the initial OA. The EA was used to implement a LDO that requires only 1.1uA quiescent current but has an output current capability of 100mA. The high slew-rate of the EA helps this LDO to achieve low overshoot/undershoot (200mV/274mV) in case of a fast (1us) load step of 100mA, while employing only an on-chip load capacitance of 100pF. Compared with similar implementations, the proposed LDO yields same or better transient performance while requiring significantly less quiescent current.

The stability of the operational amplifier (OA) is ensured for a minimum closed loop gain of 20V/V.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMICND.2015.7355237","publicationTitle":"2015 International Semiconductor Conference (CAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Semiconductor Conference (CAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347913/7355133/07355237.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","doi":"10.1109/SMICND.2015.7355237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High precision bidirectional chopper amplifier with extended common mode input voltage range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"High precision bidirectional chopper amplifier with extended common mode input voltage range","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7355237/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668023","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High precision bidirectional chopper amplifier with extended common mode input voltage range","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"104SessionSA5pag297300Bortun1052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053576S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347913","isNumber":"7355133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347913","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7355133","articleId":"7355237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7355280,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Philips Electronics Ltd., Shatin, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37081045000"},{"name":"Hung-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085615639"},{"name":"Kevin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085612984"},{"name":"Chin-Wei Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Wei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37085566467"},{"name":"Chi-Wai Chow","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Wai","lastName":"Chow","id":"37277378700"},{"name":"Chien-Hung Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Photonics, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Hung","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37276121200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7355280","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":6977},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Visible light communication using receivers of camera image sensor and solar cell.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"40KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7362283/7355280/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2507364.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7362283/7355280/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2507364.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","Gray-scale","Cameras","Image sensors","Uplink","Downlink","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","free-space optical communication","image sensors","optical receivers","solar cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communication","receivers","camera image sensor","solar cell","electronic label","downlink signal","white-light light-emitting diode","LED lamp","rolling shutter pattern","second-order polynomial extinction ratio enhancement scheme","iterative schemes","modified quick adaptive thresholding schemes","bit error rate","Internet-of-Things sensing networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space communication","optical communications","light-emitting diode (LED)"]},{"kwd":["Free space communication","optical communications","light-emitting diode (LED)"]}],"abstract":"We propose an electronic label and sensor system using visible light communication (VLC).

The uplink can be captured by a surveillance camera image sensor. However, using the camera image sensor as a VLC receiver (Rx) is challenging since the data rate is limited by the frame rate and due to uneven light exposure. The rolling shutter effect of the image sensor can be used to increase the data rate. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate how to demodulate the obtained rolling shutter pattern using a second-order polynomial (SOP) extinction ratio (ER) enhancement scheme, together with iterative and modified quick adaptive thresholding schemes. The ER enhancement scheme can significantly reduce the large ER fluctuation. Experimental results show that by using the proposed SOP ER enhancement scheme, the bit error rate (BER) improvement can be up to two orders of magnitude. We also believe that the proposed electronic label and sensor system may be applicable to Internet-of-Things sensing networks for connecting a number of mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2507364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7362283/07355280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2507364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7362283","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible Light Communication Using Receivers of Camera Image Sensor and Solar Cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visible Light Communication Using Receivers of Camera Image Sensor and Solar Cell","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7800107","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15683417","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7355280/","impactStatement":"Visible light communication (VLC) is attractive as a supplementary method for future 5G wireless communication owing to the shortage of radio-frequency (RF) bandwidth in conventional wireless communications.

First, with an aim toward the biodiversity of resources and tasks in cloud computing, we propose a resource cost model that defines the demand of tasks on resources with more details. This model reflects the relationship between the user's resource costs and the budget costs. A multi-objective optimization scheduling method has been proposed based on this resource cost model. This method considers the makespan and the user's budget costs as constraints of the optimization problem, achieving multi-objective optimization of both performance and cost. An improved ant colony algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. Two constraint functions were used to evaluate and provide feedback regarding the performance and budget cost. These two constraint functions made the algorithm adjust the quality of the solution in a timely manner based on feedback in order to achieve the optimal solution. Some simulation experiments were designed to evaluate this method's performance using four metrics: 1) the makespan; 2) cost; 3) deadline violation rate; and 4) resource utilization. Experimental results show that based on these four metrics, a multi-objective optimization method is better than other similar methods, especially as it increased 56.6% in the best case scenario.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"2687","endPage":"2699","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2508940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2508940","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07355287.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduling Method Based on the Ant Colony Algorithm in Cloud Computing","topic":"Big Data Services and Computational Intelligence for Industrial Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355287/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduling Method Based on the Ant Colony Algorithm in Cloud Computing","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15656087","volume":"3","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355287/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Educational Commission of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2013KJCX0131"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology\u2019s Internal Project","grantNumber":"2012RC0106"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2014A030313729"},{"fundingName":"2013 Top Level Talents Project Sailing Plan of Guangdong Province"},{"fundingName":"2014 Guangdong Province Outstanding Young Professor Project"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Key Project of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2014B010112006"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Fund of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2015A030308017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduling Method Based on the Ant Colony Algorithm in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"access-shu-2508940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084571S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Big Data Services and Computational Intelligence for Industrial Systems"],"articleId":"7355287","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7355288,"authors":[{"name":"Miquel Angel Mestre","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs France, Nozay, France"],"bio":{"p":["Miquel Angel Mestre received the Engineering degree in telecoms and\n the Master's degree in photonics from the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 2013.\n He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Paris, France.

The resulting radiated beam can be scanned by 35\u00b0 due to the phase shift in the beam introduced by its interaction with the metamaterial slabs. In addition, the proposed antenna configuration provides gain improvement of 8 dB as the slabs effectively increase the aperture size of the antenna. An array of MNZ inclusions in the E-plane of a double dipole antenna is shown to provide scanning from -35\u00b0 to +35\u00b0 with respect to the end-fire direction over 57-64 GHz. 2-D beam-scanning was realized by increasing the number of MNZ unit-cells in the elevation plane of double dipole antenna. Loading the slabs in front of the double dipole antenna with 10 \u00d7 7 array of MNZ unit-cells is shown to provide a beam deflection of 35\u00b0 in both the azimuth and elevation planes.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2508478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7396973/07355295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2508478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396973","startPage":"564","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One- and Two-Dimensional Beam-Switching Antenna for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"One- and Two-Dimensional Beam-Switching Antenna for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755261","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7355295/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One- and Two-Dimensional Beam-Switching Antenna for Millimeter-Wave MIMO Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-dadgarpour-2508478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102321S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7396973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7396973","articleId":"7355295","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355297,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Shao","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing, P.R China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Shao","id":"37075649600"},{"name":"Wenpeng Jing","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing, P.R China"],"firstName":"Wenpeng","lastName":"Jing","id":"37085450046"},{"name":"Xiangming Wen","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing, P.R China"],"firstName":"Xiangming","lastName":"Wen","id":"37397329700"},{"name":"Zhaoming Lu","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing, P.R China"],"firstName":"Zhaoming","lastName":"Lu","id":"37402833000"},{"name":"Haijun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Haijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085814411"},{"name":"Yawen Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing, P.R China"],"firstName":"Yawen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085366350"},{"name":"Dabing Ling","affiliation":["China Academy of Information and Communication Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dabing","lastName":"Ling","id":"37893380100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7355297","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":512},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Power demand","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Measurement","Linear programming","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of experience","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimization","quality of experience","power consumption","OFDMA multicell networks","QoE based radio resource allocation","FQRA","performance metric","subchannel allocation","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FQRA","Energy efficiency","Joint Optimization","QoE","Resource Allocation"]},{"kwd":["FQRA","energy efficiency","joint optimization","QoE","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Quality of experience (QoE) and power consumption are two important considerations of OFDMA multicell networks.

A novel utility function, which can characterize the fairness of users' QoE and power consumption jointly, is proposed. Then a multiuser FQRA problem is formulated.

The focus of the paper is the energy- and cost-efficient realization of these arrays in order to enable new applications. Distributed algorithms for beamforming are proposed, and the optimum array size is considered as a function of the performance of the receiver, transmitter, frequency synthesizer, and signal distribution within the array. The effects of errors such as phase noise and synchronization skew across the array are analyzed. The paper discusses both RF frequencies below 10 GHz, where fully digital techniques are preferred, and operation at millimeter (mm)-wave bands where a combination of digital and analog techniques are needed to keep cost and power low.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2492539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2492539","startPage":"586","endPage":"606","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7410133/07355304.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Energy- and Cost-Efficient Massive MIMO Arrays","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/7410133/7355304-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of Energy- and Cost-Efficient Massive MIMO Arrays","volume":"104","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15786853","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7355304/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF"},{"fundingName":"DARPA"},{"fundingName":"UC Discovery Program"},{"fundingName":"BWRC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Design of Energy- and Cost-Efficient Massive MIMO Arrays","sourcePdf":"jproc-niknejad-2492539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192645S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7410133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7410133","articleId":"7355304","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7355308,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Triana","affiliation":["High Frequency Electronics and Communications Research Group (CMUN), Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia","Optical and Quantum Communications Group, Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia (iTEAM) Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9s","lastName":"Triana","id":"37085650242"},{"name":"Daniel Pastor","affiliation":["Optical and Quantum Communications Group, iTEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37085480739"},{"name":"Margarita Var\u00f3n","affiliation":["CMUN Research Group, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, DC, Colombia"],"firstName":"Margarita","lastName":"Var\u00f3n","id":"37061414700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7355308","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fiber gratings","Optical sensors","Encoding","Wavelength division multiplexing","Time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","demodulation","fibre optic sensors","infrared spectra","optical design techniques","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overlap-proof fiber Bragg grating sensing system","spectral encoding","optical orthogonal codes","spectral shape","encoded FBG sensor design","reflection band","demodulation technique","wavelength position","autocorrelation product","reflection spectrum","wavelength detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber Bragg grating (FBG)","optical fiber sensor","overlap-proof","spectral encoding","demodulation"]},{"kwd":["Fiber Bragg grating (FBG)","optical fiber sensor","overlap-proof","spectral encoding","demodulation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a spectral encoding of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors is proposed in order to solve their wavelength under overlapping conditions. Our technique uses optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) to define the spectral shape of the FBG sensors. In this way, we design encoded FBG sensors composed of more than one reflection band; the spectral location of the reflection bands is determined by the OOC, providing each encoded FBG sensor with a unique spectral signature. The demodulation technique for the proposed sensors makes use of their orthogonal nature: it obtains the wavelength position for each sensor by obtaining the autocorrelation product between the reflection spectrum and each sensor's spectral code. These FBG sensors have been manufactured and experimentally validated. The results demonstrate the overlap-proof nature of the encoded sensors. Furthermore, the very simple demodulation technique provides highly accurate wavelength detection and can be implemented in real-time detection systems.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2015.2508743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7419307/07355308.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2015.2508743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","startPage":"744","endPage":"747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlap-Proof Fiber Bragg Grating Sensing System Using Spectral Encoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Overlap-Proof Fiber Bragg Grating Sensing System Using Spectral Encoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355308/","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7355308/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15803024","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n","grantNumber":"TEC2013-42332-P and TEC 2009-12169"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlap-Proof Fiber Bragg Grating Sensing System Using Spectral Encoding","sourcePdf":"lpt-triana-2508743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054061S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7419307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7419307","articleId":"7355308","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355317,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Mani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Mani","id":"37085471560"},{"name":"Hamid Saeedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37294647900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7355317","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355317","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Generators","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","message passing","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","complexity analysis","message passing algorithms","conventional decoding algorithms","Viterbi algorithm","VA","decoding complexity","memory blocks","bit-error-rate performance"]},{"kwd":["Convolutional codes","message passing algorithm","low-density parity-check codes"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose to apply message passing algorithms to decode standard convolutional codes and assess the resulting performance and the required complexity compared to conventional decoding algorithms for convolutional codes by concentrating on the Viterbi algorithm (VA). We show that, in contrast to the VA for which the decoding complexity increases exponentially with m, the number of memory blocks for the proposed framework, such an increase, is only linear in m. This suggests that applying message passing algorithms can provide considerable savings in the required computational power if it can also exhibit a comparable bit-error-rate performance to that of the VA. In this letter, we show via simulations that this is in fact the case for convolutional codes.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2508459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2508459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7399440/07355317.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7399440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message Passing-Based Decoding of Convolutional Codes: Performance and Complexity Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Message Passing-Based Decoding of Convolutional Codes: Performance and Complexity Analysis","volume":"20","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15773510","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355317/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003967","fundingName":"Iran's National Elites Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message Passing-Based Decoding of Convolutional Codes: Performance and Complexity Analysis","sourcePdf":"lcomm-saeedi-2508459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062915S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7399440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7399440","articleId":"7355317","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7355320,"authors":[{"name":"Loris Roveda","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Technologies (ITIA), Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milan, Italy","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Loris","lastName":"Roveda","id":"37085412592"},{"name":"Niccol\u00f2 Iannacci","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Technologies (ITIA), Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Niccol\u00f2","lastName":"Iannacci","id":"37085611073"},{"name":"Federico Vicentini","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Technologies (ITIA), Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Vicentini","id":"37938330000"},{"name":"Nicola Pedrocchi","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Technologies (ITIA), Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Pedrocchi","id":"37402911000"},{"name":"Francesco Braghin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Braghin","id":"37564362300"},{"name":"Lorenzo Molinari Tosatti","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Automation and Technologies (ITIA), Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo Molinari","lastName":"Tosatti","id":"37402919900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3766"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3774"}],"articleNumber":"7355320","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1448},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Impedance Force-Tracking Control Design With Impact Formulation for Interaction Tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Impedance","Dynamics","Optimal control","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compliance and Impedance Control","Force Control","Optimization and Optimal Control","Industrial Robots"]},{"kwd":["Compliance and impedance control","force control","optimization and optimal control","industrial robots"]}],"abstract":"The letter presents a force-tracking impedance controller granting a free-overshoots contact force (mandatory performance for many critical interaction tasks such as polishing) for partially unknown interacting environments (such as leather or hard-fragile materials). As in many applications, the robot has to gently approach the target environment (whose position is usually not well-known), then execute the interaction task. Therefore, the algorithm has been designed to deal with both the free space approaching motion (phase a.) and the succeeding contact task (phase b.) without switching from different control logics. Control gains have to be properly calculated for each phase in order to achieve the target force tracking performance (i.e., free-overshoots contact force). In detail, phase a. control gains are optimized based on the impact collision model to minimize the force error during the following contact task, while phase b. control gains are analytically calculated based on the solution of the LQR optimal control problem. The analytical solution grants the continuous adaptation of the control gains during the contact phase on the estimated value of the environment stiffness (obtained through an on-line extended Kalman filter). A probing task has been carried out to validate the performance of the control with partially unknown contact environment properties. Results show the avoidance of force overshoots and instabilities.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2015.2508061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/7163696/07355320.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7163696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2015.2508061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Impedance Force-Tracking Control Design With Impact Formulation for Interaction Tasks","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355320/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355320/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007601","fundingName":"Horizon 2020","grantNumber":"637095"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Impedance Force-Tracking Control Design With Impact Formulation for Interaction Tasks","sourcePdf":"lra-roveda-2508061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054273S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"7163696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7163696","articleId":"7355320","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":7355321,"authors":[{"name":"Manabu Sakai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Manabu","lastName":"Sakai","id":"37085392519"},{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279366400"},{"name":"Katsumi Yamashita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37268934800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7355321","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Indexes","Interference","Frequency-domain analysis","Receivers","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preamble-based joint estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","OQAM systems","OFDM systems","I/Q imbalance","frequency domain","Cramer-Rao bound approximation","CRB approximation","optimized pilot symbol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","I/Q imbalance"]},{"kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","I/Q imbalance"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a preamble-based joint estimation of channel and I/Q imbalance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) systems.

In this paper, we consider heterogeneous sensing environments, where the sensing quality varies due to the differences in the physical environment of each sensor node. We consider a Bayesian compressive sensing approach and propose two efficient algorithms that decrease the number of active sensor nodes while maintaining high performance. Both the selection algorithms aim to reduce the estimation error by minimizing the determinant of the error covariance matrix, which is proportional to the volume of the confidence ellipsoid. The first algorithm is the centralized greedy selection algorithm, which can achieve a nearly optimal solution in terms of the minimum confidence ellipsoid. It can also achieve almost the same level of performance as the combinatorial selection method, but has a lower complexity and outperforms the conventional convex relaxation method. The second algorithm is the decentralized selection algorithm, which is derived by approximating the determinant of the error covariance matrix. Unlike the centralized greedy algorithm, it can be done by each sensor node without heavy overhead or high complexity. Furthermore, we prove that the decentralized selection algorithm becomes equivalent to the centralized greedy algorithm as the number of sensor nodes increases. Our simulation results show that the centralized greedy selection algorithm provides the best performance while the decentralized algorithm performs nearly as well as the centralized algorithm as the number of sensor nodes increases.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2508670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7404293/07355332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2508670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404293","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariated Bayesian Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multivariated Bayesian Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15785820","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7355332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2012R1A1A1014392"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Korean Government within the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"NRF-2012R1A2A2A01047554"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariated Bayesian Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-kim-2508670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110375S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7404293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7404293","articleId":"7355332","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355336,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Ping Sheu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7434088/7355336/jsheu-2508803-small.gif","p":["Jang-Ping Sheu (S\u201985\u2013M\u201986\u2013SM\u201998\u2013F\u201909) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1981, 1983, and 1987, respectively.

Channel hopping schemes have been proposed to avoid the problems mentioned above. In this paper, we introduce two quorum-based channel hopping schemes.

Resistance degradation in interconnect metal lines caused by voiding was studied in this paper theoretically by solving the continuity equation describing the stress evolution caused by growing void. A rigid confinement surrounding a metal line makes inapplicable an approximation of the line edge drift for modeling the void volume evolution unless a line is in a stress-free equilibrium state caused by the presence of a saturated void. Derived analytical solution to the continuity equation with a voidless initial condition provides drastically different stress evolution kinetics in comparison with the case of the line edge drift model. It demonstrates that a large stress gradient, which was developed between the surface of a void precursor (flaw) and a metal, becomes a major driving force for the atom migration from the void surface to the metal. In this case, the initial evolution of the void volume does not depend on the electric current density contrary to the case of the line edge drift approximation characterized by the linear dependence of the void growth rate on the current density. At long time limit, the derived solution provides the same kinetics and the steady state with the stress linearly distributed along the line as in the case of preexisted void. The proposed model results much faster kinetics of the void growth and the line resistance degradation than the line edge drift approximation. Void nucleation time can be employed as a reasonable approximation of the EM-induced time to failure in the confined metal line.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/7426441/07355338.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2015.2508447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2015.2508447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7426441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Postvoiding Stress Evolution in Confined Metal Lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current density","Stress","Metals","Resistance","Integrated circuit interconnections","Kinetic theory","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current density","electromigration","integrated circuit reliability","nucleation","voids (solid)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["confined metal lines","postvoiding stress evolution","electromigration-induced voiding","reliability concern","modern integrated circuits","resistance degradation","interconnect metal lines","continuity equation","growing void","rigid confinement","void volume evolution","stress-free equilibrium state","saturated void","stress evolution kinetics","void precursor","atom migration","void surface","line edge drift approximation","current density","void nucleation time"]},{"kwd":["Boundary value problem","finite element analysis","integrated circuit interconnect","integrated circuit reliability","resilience"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Postvoiding Stress Evolution in Confined Metal Lines","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7355338/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823886","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Postvoiding Stress Evolution in Confined Metal Lines","sourcePdf":"tdmr-sukharev-2508447-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089931S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"7426441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7426441","articleId":"7355338","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355340,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Junnila","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Ville Junnila received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Turku, Finland, in 2007 and 2011, respectively, both in pure mathematics.","Since July 2007, he has been with the Department of Mathematics, University of Turku.

The transformation of a Chebyshev polynomial is studied and applied to achieve an equal source and load termination for an even-order filtering response. This transformed Chebyshev polynomial is used to design a millimeterwave (mmW) SIW bandpass filter through electric coupling of SIW resonators or cavities. The cascaded resonators are formed by properly etching the slots on the top metal plane of a single SIW cavity, and these slots create electric coupling as desired in a filter design. The proposed synthesis procedure of coupled-resonator bandpass filter with an even-order Chebyshev response is given and discussed here in detail. The theoretical and extracted external quality factor (QE) and coupling coefficient (K) are utilized to determine the filter circuit dimensions. Two fourth-order bandpass filters are designed at 140 GHz under a Chebyshev response using magnetic coupling and electric coupling as design examples. These two filters are used to prove the correctness of the proposed synthesis method as well as the advantages of electric coupling in mmW. In order to prove the validity, the previously proposed fourth-order filter using electric coupling is fabricated. The filter is fabricated in a single substrate layer using a low-temperature cofired ceramic technology and measured in a frequency band around 140 GHz. The measured results are in good agreement with simulated results.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2502420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7386538/07355343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2502420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","startPage":"126","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis Method for Substrate-Integrated Waveguide Bandpass Filter With Even-Order Chebyshev Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis Method for Substrate-Integrated Waveguide Bandpass Filter With Even-Order Chebyshev Response","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355343/","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7355343/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15721703","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0214"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis Method for Substrate-Integrated Waveguide Bandpass Filter With Even-Order Chebyshev Response","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-wang-2502420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077742S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7386538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7386538","articleId":"7355343","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7355344,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuju Diao","affiliation":["CNEX Labs, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Qiuju Diao (M\u2019\u2013) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xi\u2019an University of Science and Technology, Xi\u2019an, China in 2007, and Ph.D degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of California, Davis, CA in 2013.

Such considerations have motivated this further investigation. A new and simple construction of a type of partial geometries with a quasi-cyclic (QC) structure is given and their properties are investigated. Two new classes of this type of partial geometries, one based on prime fields and the other based on cyclic subgroups of prime orders of finite fields, are constructed. QC-LDPC codes with good error performances are constructed based on these two new classes of partial geometries. The trapping sets of the partial geometry codes were previously considered using the geometric aspects of the underlying structure to derive information on the size of allowable trapping sets. This topic is further considered here. Finally, there is a natural relationship between partial geometries and strongly regular graphs. The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of such graphs are well known, and it is of interest to determine if any of the Tanner graphs derived from the partial geometries are good expanders for certain parameter sets, since it can be argued that codes with good geometric and expansion properties might perform well on the AWGN channel under message-passing decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2508455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7473802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2508455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7473802/07355344.pdf","startPage":"2947","endPage":"2965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Classes of Partial Geometries and Their Associated LDPC Codes","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7473802/7355344-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"New Classes of Partial Geometries and Their Associated LDPC Codes","volume":"62","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355344/","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16003584","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355344/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1015548"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"New Classes of Partial Geometries and Their Associated LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-li-2508455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.312579S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7473802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7473802","articleId":"7355344","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7355345,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Daniel Jones","affiliation":["University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Alexander Daniel Jones studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, receiving his Ba and MMath in 2011, after which he studied for a PhD in Mathematics at the Cambridge Center for Analysis.

Instead, the key property that permits efficient recovery in such problems is the so-called local incoherence. Similarly, the standard notion of sparsity is also inadequate for many real-world problems. In particular, in many applications, the optimal sampling strategy depends on asymptotic incoherence and the signal sparsity structure. The purpose of this paper is to study asymptotic incoherence and its implications toward the design of optimal sampling strategies and efficient sparsity bases. How fast asymptotic incoherence can decay in general for isometries is determined. Furthermore, it is shown that Fourier sampling and wavelet sparsity, while globally coherent, yield optimal asymptotic incoherence as a power law up to a constant factor. Sharp bounds on the asymptotic incoherence for Fourier sampling with polynomial bases are also provided. A numerical experiment is also presented to demonstrate the role of asymptotic incoherence in finding good subsampling strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2508562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7384825/07355345.pdf","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2508562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Asymptotic Incoherence and Its Implications for Compressed Sensing of Inverse Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355345/","displayDocTitle":"On Asymptotic Incoherence and Its Implications for Compressed Sensing of Inverse Problems","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720282","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355345/","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/H023348/1 and EP/L003457/1"},{"fundingName":"NSF DMS","grantNumber":"1318894"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society University Research Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L003457/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Asymptotic Incoherence and Its Implications for Compressed Sensing of Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"tit-jones-2508562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111509S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7384825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7384825","articleId":"7355345","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355349,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed F.

The vessels are interconnected through an underlying directed network. Unlike the traditional dynamic positioning of individual marine surface vessels, cooperative dynamic positioning controllers are developed based on a modular design approach. Specifically, a predictor module is proposed for estimating the unknown ocean disturbances, which is able to achieve the disturbance estimation as fast as possible. Then, the controller module is designed based on a dynamic surface control technique. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop network system is established via cascade theory. Furthermore, this result is extended to output feedback, where only the position-yaw information is available. Another predictor module is developed for estimating the unmeasured velocities, as well as unknown ocean disturbances. Then, the dynamic surface control technique is employed to devise the output feedback controller. The proposed designs result in decoupled estimate and control, and can achieve fast adaptation for both state and output feedbacks. Results of comparative studies are given to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2015.2508647","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7463574/07355352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2015.2508647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463574","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Dynamic Positioning of Multiple Marine Offshore Vessels: A Modular Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Dynamic Positioning of Multiple Marine Offshore Vessels: A Modular Design","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985677","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7355352/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273137, 61273307, 51209026, 51579023 and 51579022"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570247"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department","grantNumber":"L2013202"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132014321 and 3132015021"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"14207614"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Dynamic Positioning of Multiple Marine Offshore Vessels: A Modular Design","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2508647-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112354S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7463574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7463574","articleId":"7355352","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7355353,"authors":[{"name":"Rencheng Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221037/7511814/7355353/zheng-2504083-small.gif","p":["Rencheng Zheng (M\u201911) received the Doctor of Engineering degree\n from the Kochi University of Technology, Kami, Japan, in 2009.","He is currently a Research Associate with the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo,\n Japan.

Guidelines that ensure driving safety while using conventional on-board navigation systems have already been published but do not extend to portable navigation systems; therefore, this study focused on the analysis of the eye-gaze tracking of drivers interacting with portable navigation systems in an urban area. Combinations of different display sizes and positions of portable navigation systems were adopted by 20 participants in a driving simulator experiment. An expectation maximum algorithm was proposed to classify the measured eye-gaze points; furthermore, three measures of glance frequency, glance time, and total glance time as a percentage were calculated. The results indicated that the convenient display position with a small visual angle can provide a significantly shorter glance time but a significantly higher glance frequency; however, the small-size display will bring on significantly longer glance time that may result in the increasing of visual distraction for drivers. The small-size portable display received significantly lower scores for subjective evaluation of acceptability and fatigue; moreover, the small-size portable display on the conventional built-in position received significantly lower subjective evaluation scores than that of the big-size one on the upper side of the dashboard. In addition, it indicated an increased risk of rear-end collision that the proportion of time that the time-to-collision was less than 1 s was significantly shorter for the portable navigation than that of traditional on-board one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eye-Gaze Tracking Analysis of Driver Behavior While Interacting With Navigation Systems in an Urban Area","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2015.2504083","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/7511814/07355353.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2015.2504083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7511814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Eye-Gaze Tracking Analysis of Driver Behavior While Interacting With Navigation Systems in an Urban Area","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7355353/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16139127","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001700","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eye-Gaze Tracking Analysis of Driver Behavior While Interacting With Navigation Systems in an Urban Area","sourcePdf":"thms-zheng-2504083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0899S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7511814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7511814","articleId":"7355353","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355354,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7406792/7355354/zhgao-2508809-small.gif","p":["Zhen Gao (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree (highest Hons.) from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011.

To realize its potential performance gain, accurate channel estimation is essential. However, due to massive number of antennas at the base station (BS), the pilot overhead required by conventional channel estimation schemes will be unaffordable, especially for frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO. To overcome this problem, we propose a structured compressive sensing (SCS)-based spatio-temporal joint channel estimation scheme to reduce the required pilot overhead, whereby the spatio-temporal common sparsity of delay-domain MIMO channels is leveraged. Particularly, we first propose the nonorthogonal pilots at the BS under the framework of CS theory to reduce the required pilot overhead. Then, an adaptive structured subspace pursuit (ASSP) algorithm at the user is proposed to jointly estimate channels associated with multiple OFDM symbols from the limited number of pilots, whereby the spatio-temporal common sparsity of MIMO channels is exploited to improve the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal channel correlation, we propose a space-time adaptive pilot scheme to further reduce the pilot overhead. Additionally, we discuss the proposed channel estimation scheme in multicell scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate channels with the reduced pilot overhead, and it is capable of approaching the optimal oracle least squares estimator.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2508809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2508809","startPage":"601","endPage":"617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07355354.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured Compressive Sensing-Based Spatio-Temporal Joint Channel Estimation for FDD Massive MIMO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Structured Compressive Sensing-Based Spatio-Temporal Joint Channel Estimation for FDD Massive MIMO","volume":"64","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15786065","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7355354/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61411130156, 61571270 and 61201185"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Compressive Sensing-Based Spatio-Temporal Joint Channel Estimation for FDD Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gao-2508809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125822S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7355354","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7355358,"authors":[{"name":"Yitong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7406792/7355358/yitli-2508930-small.gif","p":["Yitong Li received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2011.

Despite extensive studies, how to characterize the maximum sum rate of the simplest version of random access, Aloha, remains an open question. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the sum rate performance of slotted Aloha networks is presented. By extending the unified analytical framework from the classical collision model to the capture model, the network steady-state point in saturated conditions is derived as a function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold, which determines a fundamental tradeoff between the information encoding rate and the network throughput. To maximize the sum rate, both the SINR threshold and backoff parameters of nodes should be properly selected. Explicit expressions of the maximum sum rate and the optimal setting are obtained, which show that similar to the sum capacity of the multiple access channel, the maximum sum rate of slotted Aloha also logarithmically increases with the mean received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but the high-SNR slope is only $e^{-1}$. Effects of backoff and power control on the sum rate performance of slotted Aloha networks are further discussed, which shed important light on the practical network design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Sum Rate of Slotted Aloha With Capture","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2508930","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07355358.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2508930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Sum Rate of Slotted Aloha With Capture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7355358/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786063","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"U 112810"},{"fundingName":"CityU Strategic Research","grantNumber":"7004232"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Sum Rate of Slotted Aloha With Capture","sourcePdf":"tcomm-dai-2508930-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111427S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7355358","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355373,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Hsiou Hsu","affiliation":["Dept. of Bioengineering (BIOE), University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/7426433/7355373/7355373-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng-Hsiou Hsu (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2011.

Here we study and validate an optimized online recursive ICA algorithm (ORICA) with online recursive least squares (RLS) whitening for blind source separation of high-density EEG data, which offers instantaneous incremental convergence upon presentation of new data. Empirical results of this study demonstrate the algorithm's: 1) suitability for accurate and efficient source identification in high-density (64-channel) realistically-simulated EEG data; 2) capability to detect and adapt to nonstationarity in 64-ch simulated EEG data; and 3) utility for rapidly extracting principal brain and artifact sources in real 61-channel EEG data recorded by a dry and wearable EEG system in a cognitive experiment. ORICA was implemented as functions in BCILAB and EEGLAB and was integrated in an open-source Real-time EEG Source-mapping Toolbox (REST), supporting applications in ICA-based online artifact rejection, feature extraction for real-time biosignal monitoring in clinical environments, and adaptable classifications in brain-computer interfaces.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7333/7426433/7355373-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15835850","pubMedId":"26685257","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7355373/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive EEG Source Separation Using Online Recursive Independent Component Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"1R01MH084819-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Real-Time Adaptive EEG Source Separation Using Online Recursive Independent Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnsre-hsu-2508759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097186S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7426433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7426433","articleId":"7355373","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7355382,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this case, it has been shown that by using interference alignment (IA) and under the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI), the achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs) can be linearly scaled up with the number of users. However, in the presence of imperfect CSI, the sum rate becomes degraded, and the achievability of full DoF can not be guaranteed. In this paper, considering a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) IBC with constant channel coefficients, we propose IA algorithms that result in unitary beamformers. First, we consider two improved beamformer designs based on minimizing the weighted-leakage interference (Min-WLI) and maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (Max-SINR). Second, we propose a novel minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)-based IA algorithm. Both the improved Max-SINR and the MMSE-based IA schemes are optimized upon the knowledge of the channel estimation error variance so as to achieve better performance under CSI mismatch. We then demonstrate that these two schemes outperform Min-WLI and the conventional Max-SINR IA under perfect and imperfect CSI. Furthermore, it is shown that the MMSE-based IA achieves the same performance trend as the improved Max-SINR IA does; however, the former needs less CSI to be available and has less computational complexity compared to the latter. Moreover, it is established that the MMSE-based IA can result in diagonalized, decoupled subchannels under perfect CSI. The superiority of the proposed algorithms over the conventional schemes is corroborated by numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unitary Beamformer Designs for MIMO Interference Broadcast Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2508782","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7422173/07355382.pdf","startPage":"2090","endPage":"2102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2508782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Unitary Beamformer Designs for MIMO Interference Broadcast Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7355382/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"April15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15835642","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary Beamformer Designs for MIMO Interference Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-razavi-2508782-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066745S","chronDate":"April15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7422173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7422173","articleId":"7355382","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355384,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsiang Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7422173/7355384/7355384-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Hsiang Lin received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2010.","He is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Communications Engineering at NTHU.

A well-known blind HU criterion, advocated by Craig during the early 1990s, considers the vertices of the minimum-volume enclosing simplex of the data cloud as good endmember estimates, and it has been empirically and theoretically found effective even in the scenario of no pure pixels. However, such kinds of algorithms may suffer from heavy simplex volume computations in numerical optimization, etc. In this paper, without involving any simplex volume computations, by exploiting a convex geometry fact that a simplest simplex of N vertices can be defined by N associated hyperplanes, we propose a fast blind HU algorithm, for which each of the N hyperplanes associated with the Craig's simplex of N vertices is constructed from N-1 affinely independent data pixels, together with an endmember identifiability analysis for its performance support. Without resorting to numerical optimization, the devised algorithm searches for the N(N-1) active data pixels via simple linear algebraic computations, accounting for its computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations and real data experiments are provided to demonstrate its superior efficacy over some benchmark Craig-criterion-based algorithms in both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Hyperplane-Based Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Blind Hyperspectral Unmixing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2508778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7422173/07355384.pdf","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2508778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Hyperplane-Based Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Blind Hyperspectral Unmixing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7355384/","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","publicationDate":"April15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15823242","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"104-2221-E-007-069-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Hyperplane-Based Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Blind Hyperspectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"tsp-lin-2508778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182473S","chronDate":"April15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7422173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7422173","articleId":"7355384","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7355386,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Nien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Hung","lastName":"Nien","id":"37085542553"},{"name":"Jeffrey A.

However, the longer reconstruction time of SIR methods hinders their use in X-ray CT in practice. To accelerate statistical methods, many optimization techniques have been investigated. Over-relaxation is a common technique to speed up convergence of iterative algorithms. For instance, using a relaxation parameter that is close to two in alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been shown to speed up convergence significantly. This paper proposes a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian (AL) method that shows theoretical faster convergence rate with over-relaxation and applies the proposed relaxed linearized AL method to X-ray CT image reconstruction problems. Experimental results with both simulated and real CT scan data show that the proposed relaxed algorithm (with ordered-subsets [OS] acceleration) is about twice as fast as the existing unrelaxed fast algorithms, with negligible computation and memory overhead.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7445273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2508780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7445273/07355386.pdf","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1098","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2508780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaxed Linearized Algorithms for Faster X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Relaxed Linearized Algorithms for Faster X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction","volume":"35","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7355386/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15887599","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2016","pubMedId":"26685227","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"U01-EB-018753"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxed Linearized Algorithms for Faster X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tmi-nien-2508780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201348S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7445273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7445273","articleId":"7355386","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7355388,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7450231/7355388/7355388-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Kai Wen (S\u201900\u2013M\u201904) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2004.

To address this requirement, we adopt a joint channel-and-data (JCD) estimation method based on Bayes-optimal inference. This method yields minimal mean square errors with respect to the channels and payload data. We develop a Bayes-optimal JCD estimator using a recent technique based on approximate message passing.

The equivalent switching loss introduced by the passive single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) switch in the conventional radiometer is significantly reduced by the proposed single-pole-double-throw distributed amplifier (SPDT-DA), which leads to radical improvement on the receiver's noise performance. The Dicke radiometer consisting of a SPDT-DA, a four-stage low noise amplifier (LNA) and a power detector is fully integrated in a 0.13- \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS chip. With the 0.93-dB equivalent switching loss at 91 GHz of the SPDT-DA, the total noise figure (NF) of 8.4 dB at 91 GHz is achieved by the SPDT-DA followed by the LNA. With a power consumption of 28.5 mW, the radiometer obtains an overall RF gain of 42 dB and a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 0.21 K with 30-ms integration time. The two-dimensional imaging experiment with object distance of 0.7 m is successfully carried out with the radiometer chip.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7355402/","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685017","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Low Switching-Loss W-Band Radiometer Utilizing a Single-Pole-Double-Throw Distributed Amplifier in 0.13-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> SiGe BiCMOS","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ASTAR","grantNumber":"1021290051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501196"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"0118182091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Switching-Loss W-Band Radiometer Utilizing a Single-Pole-Double-Throw Distributed Amplifier in 0.13-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> SiGe BiCMOS","sourcePdf":"tmtt-bi-2504499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102453S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7370835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7370835","articleId":"7355402","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7355405,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7590228/7355405/wang-2508501-small.gif","p":["Gang Wang (M'13) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2011.","In January 2012, he joined Ningbo University, Ningbo, China, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

In the second step, we formulate another nonlinear WLS problem by combining the results in the first step and the FDOA measurements. To avoid the potential risk of local convergence, this WLS problem is reduced to an approximate WLS problem, for which the globally optimal solution can be obtained.

The exposure corresponding to the MEP is one indicator to measure the coverage quality of a WSN, reflecting how well a mobile target is monitored through the sensing field. The classical methods, such as the grid-based method and the Voronoi-diagram-based method, are not accurate enough to obtain the MEP, are too complex, and are not applicable to networks with heterogeneous sensor nodes, a large number of sensor nodes, or all-sensor field intensity function. To overcome these challenges, a numerical functional extreme (NFE) model is proposed for the MEP problem in this paper. The NFE model is a high-dimensional and nonlinear optimization problem. To efficiently solve this problem, based on the characteristics of the sensor node coverage, a new crossover operator is designed, a new local search scheme is proposed, and an upside-down operator to escape from local optima is developed. Integrating all of these, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed for the NFE model, and its global convergence with probability one is proven. An extensive collection of experiments were conducted, and the results indicate that the proposed NFE model and the developed HGA can improve the solution accuracy and can be applicable to not only the case with heterogeneous sensors but the case with a large number of sensor nodes and all-sensor field intensity function as well.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508504","startPage":"8644","endPage":"8657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07355406.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for the Minimum Exposure Path Problem of Wireless Sensor Networks Based on a Numerical Functional Extreme Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355406/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for the Minimum Exposure Path Problem of Wireless Sensor Networks Based on a Numerical Functional Extreme Model","volume":"65","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7355406/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16378704","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472297"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"BDZ021430"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory of Automatic Detecting Technology and Instruments","grantNumber":"YQ14204"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2014GXNSFAA118370"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for the Minimum Exposure Path Problem of Wireless Sensor Networks Based on a Numerical Functional Extreme Model","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2508504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140713S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7355406","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7355407,"authors":[{"name":"Xinchun Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7590228/7355407/yu-2508485-small.gif","p":["\n\nXinchun Yu received the B.S. degree in mechanics from Beihang \nUniversity, Beijing, China, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in \n2010.

Recently, a seamless handover using two antennas on the top of a train has been introduced to provide a better user experience. The two antennas are mounted on the front and the rear of the train, respectively, so that one performs handover, and the other is communicating. A bicasting mechanism is adopted to eliminate the delay and overhead of data forwarding. In this paper, we consider a new algorithm to optimize the handoff opportunity by investigating not only the hysteresis exceeding level but the signal strength of both antennas as well. The parameter selection in the algorithm is analyzed based on a probability model. Furthermore, a set of new handover procedures, which optimize the utilization of the two antennas, is proposed to decrease the overhead and improve the QoS of the users. Accordingly, numerical results show that the handover failure probability (HFP) and the communication interruption probability (CIP) are both obviously reduced.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","startPage":"8658","endPage":"8668","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07355407.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized Seamless Dual-Link Handover Scheme for High-Speed Rail","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7355407/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Optimized Seamless Dual-Link Handover Scheme for High-Speed Rail","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378679","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"10","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316100 and 2013CB338004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271222"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized Seamless Dual-Link Handover Scheme for High-Speed Rail","sourcePdf":"tvt-luo-2508485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086034S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7355407","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7355408,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7448989/7355408/jchen-2508458-small.gif","p":["Jun Chen received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maine, Orono, ME, USA, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.

An efficient interference avoidance (IA) technique is proposed that relies on the conveyance of interference statistics derived at the receiver. Using the IA information, which incurs very small overhead, the transmitter selects the subchannels to be used for communications and on these subchannels, channel state information (CSI) derived from time-division duplexing (TDD) operation is applied in linear precoding strategies to minimize transmit energy consumption. The minimum energy solution is conditioned on various factors such as channel coding characteristics, linear precoding beams, interference avoidance schemes, and channel realizations. A method for identifying the transmit power leading to optimization is derived and simulation results show the effectiveness of the techniques over MIMO fading channels with different CCI conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2508458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7448989/07355408.pdf","startPage":"2698","endPage":"2712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2508458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7448989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet-Based Energy Efficiency of MIMO Systems With Interference Avoidance Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355408/","displayDocTitle":"Packet-Based Energy Efficiency of MIMO Systems With Interference Avoidance Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15917585","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355408/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0607"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet-Based Energy Efficiency of MIMO Systems With Interference Avoidance Over Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2508458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154445S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7448989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7448989","articleId":"7355408","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355411,"authors":[{"name":"Hawal Rashid","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/7387802/7355411/7355411-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hawal Rashid received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, 2010, and is currently working toward Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are in low-noise cryogenic and room temperature THz systems, THz receiver component design, characterization and calibration."]},"firstName":"Hawal","lastName":"Rashid","id":"37605381100"},{"name":"Vincent Desmaris","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/7387802/7355411/7355411-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Desmaris received the M.Sc. degree in material science from the National Institute of Applied Science, Lyon, France, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2006.

This novel hybrid design is based on Reed's multiple branch waveguide hybrid. The primary feature of this quadrature hybrid design is the introduction of a controllable ripple in the operational band by, firstly changing the heights of the input and output branches and, secondly, by introducing three waveguide-height discontinuity sections placed symmetrically in the main waveguide. This layout allows ultra-low amplitude imbalance over a wide operational band. At the same time, it permits a greater input/output branch height as compared to the Reed's 5-branch waveguide hybrid, which should ease fabrication for short-mm and sub-mm wavelengths.

Each sensor only exchanges its local information with its neighbors. The mixture Kalman filter (MKF) is an effective technique for the state estimation in the CDLSs. We extend the MKF and develop a distributed MKF for the CDLSs. Each sensor in the network runs a local MKF and interacts with other sensors to generate a mixture Gaussian representation of the global posterior distribution. Since the global likelihood in the CDLSs is not suitable for the distributed computation, we apply the cubature rule for the calculation of likelihood, to enable the distributed implementation of the likelihood computation. Consensus algorithms are executed to fuse the observations from all sensors. For the distributed MKF, the number of particles can be significantly reduced, compared with the distributed particle filtering. Finally, we apply the distributed MKF to the maneuvering target tracking. We consider that the maneuvering variable is discrete and continuous. We also consider that the observation equation is linear and nonlinear. Simulation results illustrate that the performance of the distributed MKF is close to that of the centralized MKF in various scenarios of maneuvering target tracking.","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07355413.pdf","startPage":"8669","endPage":"8681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508456","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355413","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","Mathematical model","Kalman filters","State estimation","Fuses","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","nonlinear equations","sensor fusion","state estimation","target tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consensus-based distributed mixture Kalman filter","maneuvering target tracking","wireless sensor network","distributed state estimation","conditional dynamic linear system","CDLS","data fusion center","MKF","state estimation","mixture Gaussian representation","global posterior distribution","cubature rule","distributed particle filtering","linear equation","nonlinear equation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus algorithm","distributed state estimation","maneuvering target tracking","mixture Kalman filter (MKF)","wireless sensor network (WSN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Consensus-Based Distributed Mixture Kalman Filter for Maneuvering Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","accessionNumber":"16378703","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7355413/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus-Based Distributed Mixture Kalman Filter for Maneuvering Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2508456-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150844S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7355413","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7355414,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi P\u00e9rez-Romero","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7590228/7355414/perez-2508646-small.gif","p":["\n\nJordi P\u00e9rez-Romero (S'98\u2013M'04) received the Telecommunications Engineering degree and the Ph.D. degree from Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Signal Theory and Communications, UPC.

The framework uses a belief vector concept as a means to predict the interference affecting the different spectrum blocks (SBs) and relies on a smart analysis of the scenario dynamicity to properly determine an adequate observation strategy to balance the tradeoff between achievable performance and measurement requirements. In this respect, the paper shows that the interference dynamics in a given SB can be properly characterized through the second highest eigenvalue of the interference state transition matrix. Therefore, this indicator is retained in the proposed framework as a relevant parameter to drive the selection of both the observation strategy and spectrum selection decision-making criterion. This paper evaluates the proposed framework to illustrate the capability to properly choose among a set of possible observation strategies under different scenario conditions. Furthermore, a comparison against other state-of-the-art solutions is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","volume":"65","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"16378685","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355414/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Belief-Based Decision-Making Framework for Spectrum Selection in Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Research Council and FEDER funds","grantNumber":"ref.

We focus on a secondary system that provides wireless unicast secure layered video information to multiple single-antenna secondary receivers. The resource-allocation algorithm design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem for the minimization of the total transmit power at the secondary transmitter. The proposed framework takes into account a quality-of-service (QoS) requirement regarding video communication secrecy in the secondary system, the imperfection of the channel state information (CSI) of potential eavesdroppers (primary receivers) at the secondary transmitter, and a limit for the maximum tolerable received interference power at the primary receivers. Thereby, the proposed problem formulation exploits the self-protecting architecture of layered transmission and artificial noise generation to ensure communication secrecy. The considered nonconvex optimization problem is recast as a convex optimization problem via semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation. It is shown that the global optimal solution of the original problem can be constructed by exploiting both the primal and the dual optimal solutions of the SDP-relaxed problem. In addition, two suboptimal resource-allocation schemes are proposed for the case when the solution of the dual problem is unavailable for constructing the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate significant transmit power savings and robustness against CSI imperfection for the proposed optimal and suboptimal resource-allocation algorithms employing layered transmission compared to baseline schemes employing traditional single-layer transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07355415.pdf","startPage":"8267","endPage":"8282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Layered Transmission in Secure MISO Multiuser Unicast Cognitive Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Streaming media","Resource management","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","convex programming","mathematical programming","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","quality of service","radio receivers","radio transmitters","resource allocation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal resource-allocation algorithms","SDP-relaxed problem","semidefinite programming relaxation","self-protecting architecture","artificial noise generation","layered transmission","primary receivers","eavesdroppers","channel state information","QoS","quality-of-service","secondary transmitter","nonconvex optimization problem","multiple single-antenna secondary receivers","wireless unicast secure layered video information","secondary system","CR downlink communication network","multiuser multiple-input-single-output cognitive radio","robust resource-allocation algorithm design","secure MISO multiuser unicast cognitive radio systems","robust layered transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","layered transmission","nonconvex optimization","physical-layer security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust Layered Transmission in Secure MISO Multiuser Unicast Cognitive Radio Systems","volume":"65","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7355415/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378694","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-401-2-161"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Layered Transmission in Secure MISO Multiuser Unicast Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-ng-2508980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127602S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7355415","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7355416,"authors":[{"name":"Gaojie Chen","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, 5G Innovation Centre, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7590228/7355416/chen-2501461-small.gif","p":["\n\nGaojie Chen (S'09\u2013M'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical \ninformation engineering and the B.Ec. degree in international economics and trade from the Northwest University, Xi'an, \nChina, in 2006 and the M.Sc.

It serves as a promising technique for highly dynamic or ad hoc systems such as device-to-device and machine-type communication systems. However, the achievable secrecy performance depends highly on the level of CSI at the transmitter, the receiver, and the eavesdropper. In this article, we discuss how different levels of CSI resulting from conventional and unconventional ways of performing training and channel feedback may affect the confidentiality in terms of the information-theoretic (perfect) secrecy rate. The conventional approach refers to the emission of pilot signals from the transmitter and explicit channel feedback from the receiver. This approach is backward compatible with existing systems and allows the receiver to obtain accurate knowledge of the CSI, but may suffer from CSI leakage toward the eavesdropper. Unconventional approaches capitalize on reverse training to prevent CSI leakage and are shown to achieve significant improvements over conventional schemes in certain cases. For example, in a system with four transmit antennas and a single antenna at both the receiver and the eavesdropper, a secrecy rate gain of approximately 0.8 b/channel use at transmit SNR of 16 dB is observed over the full CSI case by providing CSI only to the transmitter (but not the receiver and the eavesdropper).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","volume":"53","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"15662011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7355561/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"To avoid or not to avoid CSI leakage in physical layer secret communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To avoid or not to avoid CSI leakage in physical layer secret communication systems","sourcePdf":"010LIN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047825S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7355551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7355551","articleId":"7355561","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7355562,"authors":[{"name":"Boulat A.

However, covert, or low probability of detection/intercept communication is crucial in many scenarios ranging from covert military operations and the organization of social unrest, to privacy protection for users of wireless networks. In addition, encrypted data or even just the transmission of a signal can arouse suspicion, and even the most theoretically robust encryption can often be defeated by a determined adversary using non-computational methods such as side-channel analysis. Various covert communication techniques have been developed to address these concerns, including steganography for finite-alphabet noiseless applications and spread-spectrum systems for wireless communications.

Recently, cooperative relaying has also been considered in the context of PHY security, which is a new security paradigm to supplement traditional cryptographic schemes that usually handle security at the upper layers. In wireless PHY security, relay nodes can be used to exploit the physical layer properties of wireless channels in order to support a secured transmission from a source to a destination in the presence of one or more eavesdroppers. While some breakthroughs have been made in this emerging research area, to date, the problem of how to effectively adopt advanced relaying protocols to enhance PHY security is still far from being fully understood. In this article, we present a comprehensive summary of current state-of-theart PHY security concepts in wireless relay networks. A case study is then provided to quantify the benefits of power allocation and relay location for enhanced security. We finally outline important future research directions in relaying topologies, full-duplex relaying, and cross-layer design that can ignite new interests and ideas on the topic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"53","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15662025","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7355563/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer security in wireless cooperative relay networks: state of the art and beyond","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer security in wireless cooperative relay networks: state of the art and beyond","sourcePdf":"012JIMINEZ_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053562S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7355551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"7355551","articleId":"7355563","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7355564,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaoming Chen [m'10, Sm' received his B.Sc. degree from Hohai University in 2005, his M.Sc. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2007, and his Ph.

Even though these technologies are usually considered separately, their combination enables two key cooperative features: sensing and maneuvering. Cooperative sensing allows vehicles to exchange information gathered from local sensors. Cooperative maneuvering permits inter-vehicle coordination of maneuvers. These features enable the creation of cooperative autonomous vehicles, which may greatly improve traffic safety, efficiency, and driver comfort. The first generation V2X communication systems with the corresponding standards, such as Release 1 from ETSI, have been designed mainly for driver warning applications in the context of road safety and traffic efficiency, and do not target use cases for autonomous driving. This article presents the design of core functionalities for cooperative autonomous driving and addresses the required evolution of communication standards in order to support a selected number of autonomous driving use cases. The article describes the targeted use cases, identifies their communication requirements, and analyzes the current V2X communication standards from ETSI for missing features. The result is a set of specifications for the amendment and extension of the standards in support of cooperative autonomous driving.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355568","startPage":"64","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7355551/07355568.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancements of V2X communication in support of cooperative autonomous driving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhancements of V2X communication in support of cooperative autonomous driving","volume":"53","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15662019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7355568/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancements of V2X communication in support of cooperative autonomous driving","sourcePdf":"017HOBERT_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045501S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7355551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"7355551","articleId":"7355568","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7355569,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Zheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Kan Zheng (sm'09) is currently a full professor at Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications (BUPT), China.

The features and requirements of different services are diverse in 5G. The management and coordination among heterogeneous networks, applications, and user demands need the 5G network to be open and flexible to ensure that network resources are allocated with high efficiency. To fulfill these requirements, wireless network virtualization is used to integrate heterogeneous wireless networks and coordinate network resources. In this article we propose a model of wireless network virtualization consisting of three planes: the data plane, the cognitive plane, and the control plane. A novel control signaling scheme has also been designed to support the proposed model. From the implementation perspective of network virtualization, a hierarchical control scheme based on cell-clustering has been used with dynamically optimized efficiency of resource utilization. Two use cases have been analyzed to demonstrate how the schemes work under the proposed model to improve resource efficiency and the user experience.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355551","startPage":"53","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7355551/07355585.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective approach to 5G: Wireless network virtualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7355585/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An effective approach to 5G: Wireless network virtualization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15662017","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective approach to 5G: Wireless network virtualization","sourcePdf":"034FENG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056581S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7355551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7355551","articleId":"7355585","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7355586,"authors":[{"name":"Faqir Zarrar Yousaf","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe"],"bio":{"p":["Faqir Zarrar Yousaf (zarrar.yousateneclab.eu) is a senior researcher at NEC Laboratories Europe in Heidelberg, Germany.

The initial deployment of such a VNF-graph inside a data center (DC) is a complex task with multidimensional aspects compared to deploying a single VNF that may represent a single network function. The problem space becomes more complex when each VNF is further decomposed into multiple VNF components (VNFC), where each VNFC embodies a subset of network functions attributed to the respective VNF. The challenge is to ensure that the deployment strategy meets the intra-functional constraints between the multiple VNFCs constituting the VNF-graph while ensuring service, performance and operational integrity, and also ensures optimal utilization of the underlying resources of the DC infrastructure (DCI). In this article we analyze the cost incurred by two \u201cconstraint-based heuristically applied\u201d initial VNF/VNFC deployment strategies with reference to a virtualized mobile network infrastructure providing EPCaaS (evolved packet core as a service) while taking into consideration functional and administrative constraints. The cost of deployment is measured in terms of the utilization of DC infrastructure resources such as compute and networking. We also present the discussion in view of the ETSI NFV MANO framework, undergoing standardization, that is responsible for management and orchestration of NFV systems including VNF deployment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost analysis of initial deployment strategies for virtualized mobile core network functions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355586","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7355551/07355586.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Cost analysis of initial deployment strategies for virtualized mobile core network functions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7355586/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15662029","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost analysis of initial deployment strategies for virtualized mobile core network functions","sourcePdf":"035YOUSAF_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041087S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7355551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7355551","articleId":"7355586","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7355589,"authors":[{"name":"Werner Coomans","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent"],"bio":{"p":["Werner Coomans (werner.Coomans@alCatel-luCent.com) has been an access technology researcher at Bell Labs since 2013.

With a hardware proof-of-concept platform, it is demonstrated that multi-gigabit rates are achievable over typical drop lengths of up to 130 m, with net data rates exceeding 10 Gb/s on the shortest loops. The XG-FAST technology will make fiber-to-the-frontage (FTTF) deployments feasible, which avoids many of the hurdles accompanying a traditional FTTH roll-out. Single subscriber XG-FAST devices would be an integral component of FTTH deployments, and as such help accelerate a worldwide roll-out of FTTH services. Moreover, an FTTF XG-FAST network is able to provide a remotely managed infrastructure and a cost-effective multi-gigabit backhaul for future 5G wireless networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7355551/07355589.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7355589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XG-fast: the 5th generation broadband","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","5G mobile communication","Optical fiber cables","Wireless communication","Optical fiber networks","Communication cables","Cloud computing","IEEE Standards","Communication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","broadband networks","digital subscriber lines","optical fibre subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XG-FAST","fiber-to-the-home strategy","FTTH strategy","fiber-copper deployment","digital subscriber line technology","DSL technology","5th generation broadband technology","5GBB technology","hardware proof-of-concept platform","fiber-to-the-frontage deployment","FTTF deployment","cost-effective multigigabit backhaul","5G wireless network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7355589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"XG-fast: the 5th generation broadband","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7355589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15662022","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XG-fast: the 5th generation broadband","sourcePdf":"038COOMANS_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091865S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7355551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7355551","articleId":"7355589","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7355834,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT: heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing IoT applications in the Fog: A Distributed Dataflow approach","publicationTitle":"2015 5th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IOT)","doi":"10.1109/IOT.2015.7356560","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 5th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IOT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347045/7356538/07356560.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOT.2015.7356560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7356538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Developing IoT applications in the Fog: A Distributed Dataflow approach","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7356560/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666229","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing IoT applications in the Fog: A Distributed Dataflow approach","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"IoT2015TS191570160605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073985S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347045","isNumber":"7356538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347045","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7356538","articleId":"7356560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7356593,"authors":[{"name":"Hari Chauhan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hari","lastName":"Chauhan","id":"37085496452"},{"name":"Marvin Onabajo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Marvin","lastName":"Onabajo","id":"38271188100"},{"name":"Martin McCormick","affiliation":["Lyric Labs Analog Devices Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"McCormick","id":"37085723839"},{"name":"Vlad Kvartenko","affiliation":["Lyric Labs Analog Devices Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Kvartenko","id":"37085627970"},{"name":"Robin Coxe","affiliation":["Now at Ettus Research, Santa Clara, CA","Lyric Labs Analog Devices Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Coxe","id":"37085627055"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7980-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7979-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7356593","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356593","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MATLAB","Numerical models","Radio frequency","Baseband","Power amplifiers","Mathematical model","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","linearisation techniques","optimisation","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF power amplifiers","digital predistortion","linearization techniques","DPD technique","inverted Doherty power amplifier","power 10 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","digital pre-distortion","adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)","radio frequency transceiver"]}],"abstract":"Linearization techniques such as digital predistortion (DPD) are often employed to enhance the overall performance of power amplifiers (PAs). The specific performance requirements of a system typically depend on the application. For this reason, the implementation of a DPD technique after the fabrication of a PA can result in significant overhead cost. To ensure high performance with minimum cost prior to fabrication, it is beneficial to utilize a simulation method for design optimization of both the PA and the DPD. A simulation approach was developed to enable concurrent design optimizations of a PA along with its DPD algorithm using commercially available software. Simulation results obtained with a 10 W inverted Doherty power amplifier design and a DPD solution are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7356573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCAS.2015.7356593","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Dallas Circuits and Systems Conference (DCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Dallas Circuits and Systems Conference (DCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347914/7356573/07356593.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/DCAS.2015.7356593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation method for design and optimization of RF power amplifiers with digital predistortion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A simulation method for design and optimization of RF power amplifiers with digital predistortion","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7356593/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668055","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation method for design and optimization of RF power amplifiers with digital predistortion","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"paper301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053995S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347914","isNumber":"7356573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347914","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7356573","articleId":"7356593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7356594,"authors":[{"name":"Manu Chilukuri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Manu","lastName":"Chilukuri","id":"37085687269"},{"name":"Sungyong Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Sungyong","lastName":"Jung","id":"37278069600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7980-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7979-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7356594","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356594","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","MIMICs","Integrated circuit modeling","Resistance","Potentiometers","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrating circuits","memristor circuits","summing circuits","voltage multipliers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor based memories","audio frequency range signals","nonvolatility","voltage multiplier circuit","integrator","summing amplifier","memristive devices","compact memristor emulator circuit","frequency 16 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","Integrator","Multiplier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DCAS.2015.7356594","endPage":"4","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Dallas Circuits and Systems Conference (DCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Dallas Circuits and Systems Conference (DCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347914/7356573/07356594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCAS.2015.7356594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7356573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high frequency memristor emulator circuit","abstract":"A compact memristor emulator circuit is presented.

To take full advantage of the GPU computing resources, we exploit the algorithm's inherent parallelism and make use of efficient CUDA libraries and the GPU's hierarchical memory resources. We furthermore use multi-stream scheduling and multi-GPU workload deployment strategies to pipeline streaming-detection tasks with little host-device memory copy overhead. Our flexible design is able to switch between a high accuracy Cholesky-based detection mode and a high throughput conjugate gradient (CG)-based detection mode, and supports various antenna configurations.

OTDM technology is implemented by inserting a certain length of optical fiber between the two radar transceivers, so the UWB pulses received by different transceivers can be identified by the time slots they are presented in. The UWB pulses emitted from different transceivers are designed to have opposite polarities, so it is easy to identify which transceiver the echo UWB pulse is emitted from. Therefore, the information of target in the radar coverage area can be extracted with single-channel cooperative signal processing in the CO. In addition, wavelength-reuse is applied in each transceiver to simplify the system and polarization division multiplexing is employed to avoid optical interference. An experiment is carried out, showing that 2-D localization with centimeter-level accuracy can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics

multifunctional SPV system operating with control approach based on decoupled adaptive neural network","abstract":"This paper presents a single-stage, three-phase four-wire grid tied SPV (Solar Photovoltaic) energy conversion system with a decoupled adaptive neural network based control approach for power quality improvement at AC mains. The proposed solar PV energy conversion system, along with feeding fundamental active power to the grid, is capable of compensating linear and nonlinear loads with MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking), supply currents balancing, harmonics elimination, PFC (Power Factor Correction) and mitigation of neutral current. The proposed control approach is based on a decoupled adaptive neural network for each phase, which is used along with PV power feed-forward compensation. Decoupled adaptive neural network for each phase improves the convergence speed and provides fast dynamic response to sudden and severe load changes. The proposed grid tied SPV energy conversion system is implemented using DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and its detailed performance analysis is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356806/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15665452","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7356806/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A distribution grid tied multifunctional SPV system operating with control approach based on decoupled adaptive neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distribution grid tied multifunctional SPV system operating with control approach based on decoupled adaptive neural network","confLoc":"Addison, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"2015IACC0385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109901S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7339353","isNumber":"7356738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7339353","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7356738","articleId":"7356806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7356812,"authors":[{"name":"Fayez F.

Therefore prevention and early detection of fault occurrence are crucial in the industrial field. End winding turns can suffer from mechanical vibration due to electromagnetic efforts. With aging, end winding blocking systems become weaker and turns insulation degrades until its breakdown. In this paper, a modeling and a detection method for intermittent inter-turn fault in PMSM stator end winding is presented. The given fault model is an intermittent inter-turn short circuit in the stator winding. In steady state operation, stator currents and reference voltages under fault condition contain fault information, and will be used for its detection. The method is based on the use of a wavelet transform for the detection of the fault. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7339353/7356738/07356845.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2015.7356845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2015.7356845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7356738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and diagnostic of incipient inter-turn faults for a three phase permanent magnet synchronous motor using wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Stator windings","Windings","Wavelet transforms","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","permanent magnet motors","stators","synchronous motors","vibrations","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interturn faults","permanent magnet synchronous motor","PMSM","wavelet transform","stator winding","motor failure","fault occurrence detection","winding turns","mechanical vibration","end winding blocking systems","stator currents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["End windings vibration","fault detection","fault diagnosis","incipient fault","inter-turns fault","intermittent fault","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and diagnostic of incipient inter-turn faults for a three phase permanent magnet synchronous motor using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7356845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665448","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and diagnostic of incipient inter-turn faults for a three phase permanent magnet synchronous motor using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Addison, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"2015IACC0425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.765339S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7339353","isNumber":"7356738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7339353","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7356738","articleId":"7356845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7356863,"authors":[{"name":"Leo\u0161 Kuka\u010dka","affiliation":["Institute of Mechatronics and Computer Engineering, FMIIS, Technical University of Liberec, Czech republic","Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Leo\u0161","lastName":"Kuka\u010dka","id":"37085412948"},{"name":"Pascal Dupuis","affiliation":["Institute of Mechatronics and Computer Engineering, FMIIS, Technical University of Liberec, Czech republic"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Dupuis","id":"37346225400"},{"name":"Georges Zissis","affiliation":["Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Zissis","id":"37272137900"},{"name":"Milan Kol\u00e1\u0159","affiliation":["Institute of Mechatronics and Computer Engineering, FMIIS, Technical University of Liberec, Czech republic"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Kol\u00e1\u0159","id":"37085564138"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8393-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7356863","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","LED lamps","Filament lamps","Photodiodes","Power quality","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED lamps","maintenance engineering","photometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lamp charactristics","LED retrofit lamps","contemporary device flicker","photometric flicker analysis","retrofit LED lamp"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED Lamp","Power Quality","Flicker"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356863","abstract":"The paper exposes the topic of LED lamps photometric flicker.

This work keeps in mind the idea of new designs using the concept of sending the light in the correct direction and with the required intensity. New lamps based on power LED must be designed in order to fit these requirements and new tools and design procedures need to be established. Additionally, the easy implementation capability of light level regulation, 0 to 100% is an extremely interesting additional advantage to adequate light level requirements and also to introduce new possibilities through dimming capability according to external environmental conditions or if required.

The aim of developing the MSRF analysis framework is two-fold; deep understanding of the EAF characteristics, and fast and accurate generation of reference signals to the controllers of the advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters (APF), synchronous static compensators (STATCOM), energy storage systems (ESS), and etc., which may successfully compensate interharmonics, harmonics, and flicker. Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics by MSRF analysis utilizes continuously measured line currents and line voltages on the medium voltage side of the EAF transformer at a sampling rate of 25.6 kHz per data channel. It has been shown by off-line computations that compensation of the sequence components of interharmonics and harmonics of the EAF currents obtained by the proposed framework, reduces the short term flicker values at the point of common coupling by up to ten fold. The proposed MSRF analysis framework has been successfully verified by comparing the frequency spectrums of the EAF currents with Fourier analysis results based on one-cycle sliding windows of 10-cycle duration.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2015.7356882","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7339353/7356738/07356882.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2015.7356882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7356738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics of AC electric arc furnaces by multiple synchronous reference frame analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics of AC electric arc furnaces by multiple synchronous reference frame analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7356882/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665411","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics of AC electric arc furnaces by multiple synchronous reference frame analysis","confLoc":"Addison, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"2015METC0364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082985S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7339353","isNumber":"7356738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7339353","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7356738","articleId":"7356882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":7356894,"authors":[{"name":"Omar J.

Since these cables are highly capacitive with low X/R ratio, it is very important to conduct voltage stability analysis before adding a new machine to an existing power system. This paper investigates the effect of the trailing cable length on the mine substation voltage quality. An overvoltage condition which causes the failure of an auxiliary power supplies onboard one of the high power machines is investigated. The possible causes of the overvoltage, predominantly the interaction between current harmonics generated by the use of variable speed drives and the long cable capacitance and substation inductance, is described theoretically and simulated. Power requirements and installation guidelines for high power electrically driven mining shovels is established. On-site measurements are used to validate the theoretical analysis and confirm recommendations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7356894/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665409","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The effect of available short circuit capacity and trail cable length on substation voltage amplification in surface excavation industry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of available short circuit capacity and trail cable length on substation voltage amplification in surface excavation industry","confLoc":"Addison, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"2015MIC0648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05145S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7339353","isNumber":"7356738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7339353","xplore-issue":"7356738","articleId":"7356894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7356925,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohang Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37073237100"},{"name":"Yayu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Yayu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085718631"},{"name":"Fangzhou Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Fangzhou","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085701211"},{"name":"Wei Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37545084000"},{"name":"Liyan Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Liyan","lastName":"Qu","id":"37413304000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8394-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8393-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7356925","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative evaluation of wind turbine faults under variable operational conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7356925","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind turbines","Correlation","Feature extraction","Algorithm design and analysis","Condition monitoring","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","maintenance engineering","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantitative evaluation","wind turbine fault","variable operational condition","renewable electricity generation","maintenance cost","health management system","generator current signal","synchronous resampling algorithm","nonstationary current signal","fault feature extraction","signal reconstruction","Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlation dimension","current signal","fault detection","synchronous resampling","quantitative evaluation","wind turbine"]}],"abstract":"Wind turbines have been widely used for clean and renewable electricity generation. The maintenance costs of wind turbines constitute a significant portion of the total cost of the generated electricity. Thus, health management systems are increasingly needed to reduce the maintenance costs and improve the reliability of wind turbines. This paper proposes a novel framework for quantitative evaluation of faults and health conditions of wind turbines using generator current signals. A synchronous resampling algorithm is designed to handle nonstationary current signals for fault feature extraction. The extracted fault features are used to reconstruct new signals, whose correlation dimensions are then calculated by using the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm for fault and health condition evaluation of the wind turbines. Experimental studies are carried out for a wind turbine in the healthy condition and two faulty conditions. Results show that the proposed framework can not only detect the faults but also quantify different health conditions for the wind turbine.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2015.7356925","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7339353/7356738/07356925.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7356738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2015.7356925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative evaluation of wind turbine faults under variable operational conditions","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7356925/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665321","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7356925/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative evaluation of wind turbine faults under variable operational conditions","confLoc":"Addison, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"2015PSEC0593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06724S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7339353","isNumber":"7356738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7339353","xplore-issue":"7356738","articleId":"7356925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7356951,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Traditional Bounded Model Checking (BMC) or symbolic execution based methods depend upon multi-cycle circuit unrolling/analysis for stimuli generation.

SI-SMART tackles this problem by eliminating explicit unrolling of the control flow graph (CFG). This is achieved by abstracting loops present in the design under test (DUT) and attempting to learn the recurrence relations among the variables that directly or indirectly affect the target branch condition. An SMT solver is used to find correlations between the inputs and the target branches. This learned knowledge is later fed back to a combination of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and Hooke Jeeves method to attempt to reach the uncovered branches.

Employing either Wide I/O or LPDDR3 leads to different power, performance and thermal behavior of the system that necessitates a thorough analysis of both technologies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the latency, performance, power and thermal behavior of these two emerging DRAM technologies in embedded MPSoCs. We conduct a comprehensive study to understand the impact of core count, core micro-architecture, and core-memory integration technology on the trade-offs that these two memory technologies offer. We show that while stacked Wide I/O outperforms LPDDR3 by as much as 7%, it increases the power consumption by 14%.

Previous works have provided various examples of effective implementations of RPR, which however suffer from three limitations: first, these circuits are designed using ad-hoc procedures, and no generalization is provided; second, error impact analysis is carried out statistically, thus neglecting issues like non-elementary data distribution and temporal correlation. Last, only dynamic power was considered in the optimization. In this work we propose a new generalized approach to RPR that allows to overcome all these limitations, leveraging the capabilities of state-of-the-art synthesis and simulation tools. By sacrificing theoretical provability in favor of an empirical input-based analysis, we build a design tool able to automatically add RPR to a preexisting gate-level netlist. Thanks to this method, we are able to confute some of the conclusions drawn in previous works, in particular those related to statistical assumptions on inputs; we show that a given inputs distribution may yield extremely different results depending on their temporal behavior.","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357088.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automated design flow for approximate circuits based on reduced precision redundancy","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"An automated design flow for approximate circuits based on reduced precision redundancy","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666512","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357088/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated design flow for approximate circuits based on reduced precision redundancy","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052698S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357089,"authors":[{"name":"Hideyuki Ichihara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, As aminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Ichihara","id":"37275116500"},{"name":"Tomoya Inaoka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, As aminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Inaoka","id":"37085761076"},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Iwagaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, As aminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Iwagaki","id":"37273572400"},{"name":"Tomoo Inoue","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, As aminami, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoo","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37280050300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357089","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic functions","Error analysis","Circuit faults","Combinational circuits","Algorithm design and analysis","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic function","error tolerant application","minterm complement","logic circuit simplification method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357089","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357089.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic simplification by minterm complement for error tolerant application","abstract":"Error tolerant applications can tolerate specific errors, whose frequency and/or severity are within certain limits. This error tolerability is greatly instrumental in simplifying logic circuits for such applications. In this paper, we propose a logic simplification method for error tolerant application. Owing to error tolerance, we have an opportunity to complement several minterms of a given logic function within a threshold; if appropriate minterms are selected to be complemented, the given function can be greatly simplified. To select such minterms, we focus on two transformations, expansion and reduction, of prime implicants of the given logic function, and discuss the effect of the transformations on logic simplification. The proposed algorithm utilizing such transformations can efficiently find effective minterm complement. Experimental results show that, compared with a previous method, which employs only expansion of prime implications, the proposed algorithm can produce smaller logic circuits with reasonable computational effort.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666538","htmlLink":"/document/7357089/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Logic simplification by minterm complement for error tolerant application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic simplification by minterm complement for error tolerant application","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09211S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357090,"authors":[{"name":"Alvaro Velasquez","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Velasquez","id":"37085422006"},{"name":"Sumit Kumar Jha","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Sumit Kumar","lastName":"Jha","id":"37857266900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357090","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","CMOS integrated circuits","Nanoscale devices","Computer architecture","Memristors","Nanowires","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computability","electronic design automation","fault tolerant computing","integrated circuit design","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant in-memory crossbar computing","quantified constraint solving","nanoscale crossbars","Boolean formula","satisfiability modulo theories","SMT","quantified bit-vector formula","QBVF","stuck-closed interconnect defects","stuck-open interconnect defects","logical circuits","arithmetic circuits"]}],"abstract":"There has been a surge of interest in the effective storage and computation of data using nanoscale crossbars.

The write operation in STT-MRAM is of stochastic nature. Therefore, it requires a very long timing margin to maintain an acceptable level of reliability and yield. Traditionally, Error Correction Codes (ECCs) are used to reduce the timing margin in STT-MRAM. However, they impose high storage and latency overheads. In this paper, we propose a low-cost architecture-level technique to significantly reduce the amount of required timing margin. This technique employs a handshaking protocol between the memory and its controller to dynamically determine the write latency at run-time. Our simulation infrastructure comprehensively models the combined effect of process variation and stochastic write behavior at circuit-level and abstracts it to architecture-level. The simulation results show that the proposed technique not only considerably reduces the write error rate but also improves the overall system performance on average by 15.4% compared to existing solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357091","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357091.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving reliability, performance, and energy efficiency of STT-MRAM with dynamic write latency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving reliability, performance, and energy efficiency of STT-MRAM with dynamic write latency","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357091/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666536","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving reliability, performance, and energy efficiency of STT-MRAM with dynamic write latency","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082413S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7357096,"authors":[{"name":"Eishi Arima","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Eishi","lastName":"Arima","id":"37085697915"},{"name":"Hiroki Noguchi","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporate, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Noguchi","id":"38569261900"},{"name":"Takashi Nakada","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Nakada","id":"37085520421"},{"name":"Shinobu Miwa","affiliation":["The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Miwa","id":"37084556800"},{"name":"Susumu Takeda","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporate, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Susumu","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37085369685"},{"name":"Shinobu Fujita","affiliation":["Toshiba Corporate, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37275893200"},{"name":"Hiroshi Nakamura","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37279050300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357096","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357096","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Runtime","Microprocessors","Arrays","Decoding","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","low-power electronics","memory architecture","MRAM devices","performance evaluation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy impact reduction","peripheral circuits","STT-MRAM cache","last level cache implementation","LLC implementation","energy efficient microprocessors","low leakage power","memory cells","write current","power management","immediate sleep","leakage energy reduction","spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory"]}],"abstract":"Implementing last level caches (LLCs) with STT-MRAM is a promising approach for designing energy efficient microprocessors due to high density and low leakage power of its memory cells. However, peripheral circuits of an STT-MRAM cache still suffer from leakage power because large and leaky transistors are required to drive large write current to STT-MRAM element. To overcome this problem, we propose a new power management scheme called Immediate Sleep (IS). IS immediately turns off a subarray of an STT-MRAM cache if the next access is predicted to be not critical in performance. Thus, IS can effectively reduce leakage energy with little impact on performance. Our experimental results show that our technique can save the leakage energy of an STT-MRAM LLC by 32% compared to an STT-MRAM LLC with the conventional scheme at the same performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357096","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357096.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Immediate sleep: Reducing energy impact of peripheral circuits in STT-MRAM caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Immediate sleep: Reducing energy impact of peripheral circuits in STT-MRAM caches","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357096/","accessionNumber":"15666476","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Immediate sleep: Reducing energy impact of peripheral circuits in STT-MRAM caches","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054891S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7357100,"authors":[{"name":"Umer I.

The reduction in multiplication units results in over 80% reduction in hardware for floating point computation units. The architecture performs in-place inversion and provides scalability across the rows and columns. Hardware efficiency is achieved by reaping benefit from regularity in computation and better utilization of pipelined computational resources. Multiple rows are normalized within an iteration of Gauss-Jordan algorithm that allows reduction in number of floating-point multiplication units in the elimination step. In addition to implementing the architecture, an analytical performance model is also developed for InvArch and some related works.

In this paper, we first explore and establish the combined benefits of functional heterogeneity and performance heterogeneity in improving power-performance behavior of data parallel applications. Next, given an application specified in OpenCL, we present a static partitioning strategy to execute the application kernel across CPU and GPU cores along with voltage-frequency setting for individual cores so as to obtain the best power-performance tradeoff. We achieve over 19% runtime improvement by exploiting the functional and performance heterogeneities concurrently. In addition, energy saving of 36% is achieved by using appropriate voltage-frequency setting without significantly degrading the runtime improvement from concurrent execution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Multicore processing","Mobile communication","Pipelines","Runtime","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

technology integrates miniaturized components into a chip that can perform traditional biochemical laboratory procedures. Commercial impact is highlighted by the recent acquisition of Advanced Liquid Logic by Illumina Inc., a leader in DNA sequencing and biomolecular analysis. Due to the inherent variability involved in many biochemical processes, uncertainties manifest themselves in many ways in microluidics. Cyber-physical integration of on-chip sensors permits feedback-driven monitoring in-real time to detect and correct errors, along with other benefits such as adaptive control and dynamic re-synthesis. This paper overviews low-based and digital (droplet-based) microluidic biopchips, and discusses the state-of-the-art in microluidic device fabrication, the interplay between sensor feedback and adaptive control software, and practical experiences relating to biochip cyber-physical integration. It demonstrates the connections between the many fundamental principles of chip design and engineering, and the needs of the biochip community.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357107","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","startPage":"224","endPage":"227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyber-physical integration in programmable microfluidic biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cyber-physical integration in programmable microfluidic biochips","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357107/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15655493","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357107/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyber-physical integration in programmable microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"I004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129811S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357110,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas"],"firstName":"Chia-Yu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085726675"},{"name":"Helmut Graeb","affiliation":["Inst. of EDA Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Graeb","id":"37298522400"},{"name":"Jiang Hu","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37278204300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357110","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357110","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Wires","Integrated circuits","Analog circuits","Layout","Manuals","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","integer programming","integrated circuit design","linear programming","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-layout performance","op-amp designs","integer linear programming","sequential approach","automatic analog IC routing algorithms","analog integrated circuit routing","pre-search assisted ILP approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Design","Routing","Analog ICs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357110","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357110.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pre-search assisted ILP approach to analog integrated circuit routing","abstract":"The routing of analog integrated circuits (IC) has long been a challenge due to numerous constraints (such as symmetry and topology-matching) that matter for overall circuit performance. Existing automatic analog IC routing algorithms can be broadly categorized into two approaches: sequential approach that heuristically routes one net after another and constructive ILP (Integer Linear Programming). The former approach is usually fast but may miss opportunities of finding good solutions. The constructive ILP provides optimal solutions but can be very time consuming. We propose a simple yet efficient method that combines the advantages of both existing approaches. First, sequential routing is performed to obtain a set of candidate routing paths for each net. Then, an ILP is applied to commit each net to only one of its candidate routes. Experiments on two op-amp designs show that the post-layout performance (such as gain and phase margin) from our method is close to that of manual design. Our method also outperforms a previous work of automated analog IC routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357110/","xploreNote":"As originally submitted and published there was an error in this document.

Memristor is one of the promising candidates due to its scalability, practically zero leakage, non-volatility, etc. This paper proposes a novel design methodology for logic circuits targeting memristor crossbars. This methodology allows the optimization of the design of logic function, and their automatic mapping on the memristor crossbar. More important, this methodology supports the execution of Boolean logic functions within constant number of steps independent of its functionality. To illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology, multi-bit adders and multipliers are explored; their incurred delay, area and energy costs are analyzed. The comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art Boolean logic circuits for memristor crossbar architecture shows significant improvement in both delay (4 to 500 x) and energy consumption (1.22 to 3.71 x). The area overhead may decrease (down to 44%) or increase (up to 17%) depending on the circuit's functionality and logic optimization level.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357122","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357122.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast boolean logic mapped on memristor crossbar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast boolean logic mapped on memristor crossbar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666506","htmlLink":"/document/7357122/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast boolean logic mapped on memristor crossbar","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141954S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7357123,"authors":[{"name":"Kaveh Shamsi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Kaveh","lastName":"Shamsi","id":"37085639068"},{"name":"Yu Bi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Bi","id":"37085596329"},{"name":"Yier Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085647941"},{"name":"Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre-Emmanuel","lastName":"Gaillardon","id":"37399788600"},{"name":"Michael Niemier","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Niemier","id":"37274671800"},{"name":"X.

In this paper, we show how circuit operation parameters, such as the pulse amplitude and pulse widths of word-line (WL) voltage, bit-line (BL) voltage, and source-line (SL) voltage can be used to lower latency, lower power and improve reliability. SPICE simulation results demonstrate that appropriate choice of voltage settings can be used to reduce the write latency of the 1T1R cell by 29.4% and reduce write energy by 46.7% over the DRAM cell. Next, we show how the endurance of ReRAM cell can be improved by increasing the ratio between OFF and ON resistances and reducing SL voltage. We find that of these, reducing the SL voltage results in significant improvement in endurance with smaller energy overhead. Next, we evaluate the system-level performance of a 1GB ReRAM and DRAM memory system using CACTI and GEM5. Simulation results using SPEC CPU INT 2006 and DaCapo-9.12 benchmarks show that the ReRAM based main memory can improve IPC by 4.2% and energy by up to 77.8% compared to a DRAM system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357125/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666545","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing latency, energy, and reliability of 1T1R ReRAM through appropriate voltage settings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing latency, energy, and reliability of 1T1R ReRAM through appropriate voltage settings","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079094S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357126,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Garc\u00eda-Redondo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, E.T.S.I.

In this paper we propose a novel thermal-adaptive RRAM writing scheme, applicable to crossbar memories, whose smart operation is able to mitigate the writing errors induced by temperature variations. Using a sensing-acting scheme our system is able to improve the memory reliability without affecting the writing/reading performance. Moreover, the proposed architecture is compatible with most proposed write/read designs making achievable multibit storage, which requires extremely accurate operations.","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","startPage":"367","endPage":"374","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357126","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357126.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A thermal adaptive scheme for reliable write operation on RRAM based architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357126/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A thermal adaptive scheme for reliable write operation on RRAM based architectures","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666489","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357126/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A thermal adaptive scheme for reliable write operation on RRAM based architectures","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083112S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7357128,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Malik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Malik","id":"38468662900"},{"name":"Houman Homayoun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Houman","lastName":"Homayoun","id":"37398927100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357128","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Power demand","Program processors","Servers","Energy efficiency","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","embedded systems","energy conservation","low-power electronics","multiprocessing systems","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power cores","low power embedded processors","Big Data workloads","low-power embedded processors","ARM","Atom","high-performance server market","data center workloads","low-power embedded architectures","performance measurements","system level analysis","energy-efficiency","Big Data analytics applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance","Power","Energy-efficiency","Big Data","Low-Power server"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357128","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357128","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","abstract":"The traditional low-power embedded processors such as ARM and Atom are entering the high-performance server market.

Stochastic circuits claim to have a reduced energy consumption at the cost of accuracy and delay. In this paper, we explore the power, delay, energy and area of a stochastic circuit (a stochastic multiplier in particular), and compare these metrics with those of a regular multiplier, implemented using the Sum Of Products (SOP) approach. The SOP based multiplier is implemented both using a Kogge-Stone Adder, as well as a Ripple-Carry adder. Our results show that when the stochastic number generator (SNG) and counter are included in the stochastic multiplier (SM), even for 3 bits, the SM consumes more energy to finish one multiplication than an SOP based regular binary multiplier (RM), and this energy consumption grows exponentially as the number of bits increases. If we only consider the stochastic multiplier cell (SMC, which is simply a 2-input AND gate) and ignore the energy of the SNG and counter, the SMC has a better energy consumption for multiplications up to 12 bits. However, even for 3 bits, the SM (or the SMC) is slower by over 5x compared to the regular multiplier, and this delay increases exponentially as the number of bits increases. The area of the SM (including the area of the SNG and counter) is smaller for multipliers with more than 6 bits.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","startPage":"391","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357131.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring the viability of stochastic computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357131/","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the viability of stochastic computing","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666468","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the viability of stochastic computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060703S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357137,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

However, PUF stability with respect to temporal variations still limits its utility and widespread acceptance. Previous techniques in the literature have focused on improving PUF robustness against voltage and temperature variations, but the issues associated with aging have been largely neglected. In this paper, we propose a reliable pair selection algorithm (RePa) that can generate reliable keys from an RO-PUF under aging, voltage, and temperature variations. The RePa approach selects RO pairs with both initial frequency difference and aging rate/slope in mind. The aging slope is predicted by exploiting correlation that exists between frequency variation with respect to voltage and frequency variation with respect to aging. We evaluate RePa with simulations to show that it achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art in terms of reliability and cost. The proposed approach can achieve ~ 3.0x more robust key with only ~ 2.3x more ROs required than the conventional RO-PUF pair selection for the same key size.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357137","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357137.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pair selection algorithm for robust RO-PUF against environmental variations and aging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A pair selection algorithm for robust RO-PUF against environmental variations and aging","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357137/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666501","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pair selection algorithm for robust RO-PUF against environmental variations and aging","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064896S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7357142,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Z.

Sorting accelerators can achieve high performance and low power because they lack the overheads of sorting implementations on general purpose hardware, such as instruction fetch and decode. We find that sorting accelerators are a good match for 3D-stacked Near Data Processing (NDP) because their sorting throughput is so high that it saturates the memory bandwidth available in other memory organizations. The increased sorting performance and low power requirement of fixed-function hardware lead to very high Map phase performance and energy efficiency, reducing Map phase execution time by up to 92%, and reducing energy consumption by up to 91%. We further find that sorting accelerators in a less exotic form of NDP outperform more expensive forms of 3D-stacked NDP without accelerators. We also implement the accelerator on an FPGA to validate our claims.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357143","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357143.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-function hardware sorting accelerators for near data MapReduce execution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-function hardware sorting accelerators for near data MapReduce execution","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357143/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666472","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357143/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-function hardware sorting accelerators for near data MapReduce execution","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062986S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7357145,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Mao","affiliation":["Software School of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Mao","id":"37408712700"},{"name":"Suzhen Wu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Suzhen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407116200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357145","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Parallel processing","Time factors","Dispatching","Performance evaluation","Throughput","System software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","parallel processing","performance evaluation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average waiting times","I/O waiting queue","garbage collection aware request dispatching","size-based request ordering","SSD-based storage systems","flash chips","low-level internal parallelism","up-level request characteristics","Amphibian","I/O scheduler","SSD performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solid State Drive","Request Characteristics","Internal Parallelism","I/O Scheduler","Performance Evaluation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new I/O scheduler for SSDs, called Amphibian, which exploits the up-level request characteristics and the low-level internal parallelism of flash chips to improve the performance of SSD-based storage systems. Amphibian includes two parts: the size-based request ordering that gives higher priority to first processing the small requests and the Garbage Collection (GC) aware request dispatching that avoids issuing requests to the flash chips that are in the GC state. By first processing the small requests and avoiding issuing the GC-conflict requests in the I/O waiting queue, the average waiting times of the requests are reduced significantly. The extensive evaluation results show that compared with existing I/O schedulers, Amphibian improves the throughput and the average response times significantly. Consequently, the I/O performance of the SSD-based storage systems is improved.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357145","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357145.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting request characteristics and internal parallelism to improve SSD performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting request characteristics and internal parallelism to improve SSD performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357145/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666461","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357145/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting request characteristics and internal parallelism to improve SSD performance","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046204S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7357146,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongjae Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongjae","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085623040"},{"name":"Wooyoung Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wooyoung","lastName":"Jang","id":"37396996900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357146","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357146","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Microprocessors","Mobile communication","Power demand","Memory management","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","low-power electronics","memory architecture","portable computers","screens (display)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDRAM","screen orientations","mobile devices","image applications","graphic applications","dynamic random access memory data","power consumption","DRAM architecture","memory cells","memory utilization","memory latency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","System-on-Chip","Mobile System","Image"]}],"abstract":"Depending on the screen orientations of mobile devices, image and graphic applications access dynamic random access memory (DRAM) data in the complicated manner. Since conventional DRAMs cannot provide successive data in the same column, however, they achieve poor performance, and high power consumption in any screen orientations. This paper presents a novel DRAM efficient for both portrait and landscape screen orientations of mobile systems. We develop a simple, yet effective memory cell that is activated not only by a row activation command, but also by a new column activation command. Next, our DRAM architecture makes all the memory cells either on the same row, or on the same column successively accessed. The proposed DRAM commands and states are completely compatible with the conventional DRAM.

There are several on-going efforts to architect main memory systems with these new NVMs that can compete with traditional DRAM systems. Each NVM has peculiarities that require new microarchitectures and protocols for memory access. In this work, we focus on memristor technology and the sneak currents inherent in memristor crossbar arrays. A read in state-of-the-art designs requires two consecutive reads; the first measures background sneak currents that can be factored out of the current measurement in the second read. This paper introduces a mechanism to reuse the background sneak current measurement for subsequent reads from the same column, thus introducing \"open-column\" semantics for memristor array access. We also examine a number of data mapping policies that allow the system to balance parallelism and locality. We conclude that on average, it is better to prioritize locality; our best design yields a 20% improvement in read latency and a 26% memory power reduction, relative to the state-of-the-art memristor baseline.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357164","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357164.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving memristor memory with sneak current sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving memristor memory with sneak current sharing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666492","htmlLink":"/document/7357164/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving memristor memory with sneak current sharing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110773S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7357178,"authors":[{"name":"Xianwei Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xianwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085555761"},{"name":"Youtao Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Youtao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38183309800"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280196900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357178","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357178","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Writing","Resistance","Encoding","Memory management","Phase change memory","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TriState-SET","MLC phase change memories","multilevel cell PCM","energy consumption","proactive-SET based write strategy","MLC PCM write performance","dirty memory line","energy-delay-product","word length 2 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357178","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357178.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TriState-SET: Proactive SET for improved performance of MLC phase change memories","abstract":"The emerging Phase Change Memory (PCM) has many advantages such as good scalability and low leakage. MLC (Multi-Level Cell) PCM further extends the benefits by storing two or more bits per cell and thus reducing the per bit cost. However, adopting MLC PCM in main memory often leads to long write latency, high energy consumption, and degraded performance. In this paper, we propose TriState-SET, a proactive-SET based write strategy for improving MLC PCM write performance. TriState-SET proactively places device cells of a dirty memory line in full SET state. By utilizing only three states of 2bit MLC PCM, TriState-SET involves only fast state transitions when writing such a line at write-back time. Our experimental results show that TriState-SET increases performance by 11% and saves system energy by 6.7% (up to 12.2%), while achieving up to 25% (average 14.1%) energy-delay-product improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357178/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666490","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"TriState-SET: Proactive SET for improved performance of MLC phase change memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TriState-SET: Proactive SET for improved performance of MLC phase change memories","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050244S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7357179,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Integrated Technology, Yonsei University"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085697770"},{"name":"Gieseo Park","affiliation":["Department of EE, The University of Texas at Dallas"],"firstName":"Gieseo","lastName":"Park","id":"37085705388"},{"name":"Mustafa M Shihab","affiliation":["Department of EE, The University of Texas at Dallas"],"firstName":"Mustafa M","lastName":"Shihab","id":"37085715295"},{"name":"David Donofrio","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Donofrio","id":"37671269300"},{"name":"John Shalf","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Shalf","id":"37281789600"},{"name":"Myoungsoo Jung","affiliation":["School of Integrated Technology, Yonsei University"],"firstName":"Myoungsoo","lastName":"Jung","id":"37085684877"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7166-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7165-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357179","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Ash","Programming","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Memory management","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","memory architecture","power aware computing","write-once storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA source code","WOM codes","write-once-memory codes","power consumption","error rate variation","dynamic latency disparity","static latency disparity","OpenNVM","highly configurable FPGA based characterization platform","highly configurable FPGA based evaluation platform","memory hierarchy","optimal placement","nonvolatile memories","low level memory characterization","open-sourced FPGA-based NVM controller"]}],"abstract":"Accurate characterization of real device samples is essential for understanding the true potential of the emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) and identifying their optimal placement in the memory hierarchy.

The power consumption of the programmable resources of FPGAs is highly sensitive to their configurations. Due to their highly flexible nature, the configurations of FPGAs routing multiplexers or Look Up Tables (LUTs) are really different from a design to another but current analytical power models cannot accurately capture the associated power differences. In this paper, we introduce a simulation-based power estimation framework for FPGAs, called FPGA-SPICE, which supports any FPGA architecture that can be described with an architectural description language. Our power estimation engine automatically generates accurate SPICE netlists according to the FPGA configurations and enables precise power analysis of FPGA architectures. SPICE testbenches can be generated at different level of complexity, denoted as full-chip-level, grid-level and component-level testbenches. Full-chip-level testbenches dump the netlists associated with the complete FPGA fabric. To reduce simulation time, FPGA-SPICE can split the full-chip-level testbenches into grid-level testbenches, each of which consisting of a complete logic block netlist, or component-level testbenches, which consider individual circuit elements, i.e., multiplexers, LUTs, flip-flops, etc., separately. We show that the grid/component-level approach can achieve 14 \u00d7 speed-up with a moderate 14% accuracy loss, compared to the full-chip level. We also use FPGA-SPICE to study the power characteristics of a commercial FPGA architecture at different technology nodes. Experimental results show that the global routing architecture consumes 50% of the total power, the local routing architecture claims for 40% of the total power, and the remaining 10% comes from the LUTs and flip-flops.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357183","publicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347055/7357071/07357183.pdf","startPage":"696","endPage":"703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-SPICE: A simulation-based power estimation framework for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-SPICE: A simulation-based power estimation framework for FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357183/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666475","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-SPICE: A simulation-based power estimation framework for FPGAs","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081313S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347055","isNumber":"7357071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347055","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7357071","articleId":"7357183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357199,"authors":[{"name":"Michelle Ichinco","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Ichinco","id":"37078298700"},{"name":"Caitlin Kelleher","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States"],"firstName":"Caitlin","lastName":"Kelleher","id":"37886947500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7457-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7456-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357199","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human factors","software reusability","source code (software)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novice programmer code example use","programming tasks","user programming behaviors","realization point","task behavior types","code reuse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["novice programming","code examples","code reuse"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357199","abstract":"Both experienced and novice programmers use examples while programming, whether from tutorials, forums, or source code.

To achieve spatial orthogonality in a LOS SATCOM channel, antenna separation of the order of hundreds of kilometres is required, either on the ground or in space. In this paper we consider small spacing between the ground terminals, and thus large separation between antennas in space by means of multiple satellites. Orbital slots for multiple satellites within two degrees are generally not viable due to adjacent satellite interference (ASI) issues from disadvantaged small user terminals. In this work we show how to benefit with MIMO spatial multiplexing and multiple satellites with closer orbital spaces. In addition to spatial multiplexing, orthogonal polarizations can double the overall bandwidth. In a SISO context, depolarization and cross talk between orthogonal polarizations are often expressed in terms of cross-polar discrimination (XPD) and cross-polar isolation (XPI) respectively. In a MIMO context, we show that polarization orthogonality is of more significance than antenna XPD or XPI. The capacity results show that significant improvement can be achieved with multiple satellites and polarization MIMO compared to conventional SISO SATCOM.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357436","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357436.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"163","endPage":"168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On MIMO SATCOM capacity analysis: Utilising polarization and spatial multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On MIMO SATCOM capacity analysis: Utilising polarization and spatial multiplexing","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357436/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665974","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357436/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On MIMO SATCOM capacity analysis: Utilising polarization and spatial multiplexing","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p163ramamurthy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053486S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357448,"authors":[{"name":"Intae Shin","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"lastName":"Intae Shin","id":"37085639054"},{"name":"Wonju Lee","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"lastName":"Wonju Lee","id":"38183857000"},{"name":"Jinkyu Kang","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"lastName":"Jinkyu Kang","id":"38194399500"},{"name":"Joonhyuk Kang","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"lastName":"Joonhyuk Kang","id":"37288717500"},{"name":"Saleh Al-Araji","affiliation":["Technology and Research (KUSTAR), Khalifa University of Science"],"lastName":"Saleh Al-Araji","id":"37265939500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357448","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Sensors","Throughput","Cascading style sheets","Receivers","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","quantisation (signal)","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative cognitive radio networks","secondary users","spectrum band","primary user","secondary receivers","detection performance reliability","fusion center","throughput enhancement","secondary networks","quantized local test statistics","energy detector","quantization bit allocation strategy","resource allocation scheme"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization bit allocation for reporting-throughput tradeoff in cooperative cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357448.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357448","startPage":"233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357448","abstract":"In cognitive radio (CR) networks, secondary users (SUs) detect and share a spectrum band assigned to a primary user (PU) to communicate with their respective secondary receivers. In order to increase the reliability of the detection performance, the SUs cooperatively sense the spectrum by reporting their local information to a fusion center (FC) after quantization. For an accurate information transferring, the use of the enormous number of quantization bits for reporting is preferred, however, it simultaneously degrades the throughput performance in the perspective of reporting-throughput tradeoff. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we focus on the throughput enhancement for the secondary networks while satisfying a target sensing performance. To this end, we derive the quantized local test statistics of energy detector and propose the quantization bit allocation strategy that maximizes the throughput performance. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive framework to employ the proposed resource allocation scheme in a dynamic environment. Through the numerical results, it is shown that the proposed work exhibits the enhanced throughput performance unlike the conventional schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666127","htmlLink":"/document/7357448/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Quantization bit allocation for reporting-throughput tradeoff in cooperative cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization bit allocation for reporting-throughput tradeoff in cooperative cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p233shin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061144S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357449,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Zaeemzadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Zaeemzadeh","id":"37085394812"},{"name":"Mohsen Joneidi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Joneidi","id":"37074420200"},{"name":"Behzad Shahrasbi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Shahrasbi","id":"37546712500"},{"name":"Nazanin Rahnavard","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Nazanin","lastName":"Rahnavard","id":"37085377415"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357449","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Time measurement","Cognitive radio","Frequency measurement","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","data handling","matrix decomposition","minimax techniques","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["missing spectrum data recovery","cognitive radio networks","piecewise constant nonnegative matrix factorization","spectrum measurements","channel gain matrix","activation matrix","piecewise constant activation coefficients","optimization problem","majorization-minimization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","Cognitive Radio Network","Spectrum Sensing","Missing Data Estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a missing spectrum data recovery technique for cognitive radio (CR) networks using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

Spectral efficiency (SE), defined as the average data rate per unit bandwidth, quantifies how efficiently the available spectrum is utilized. Energy efficiency (EE), defined as the successful transmitted information bits per unit energy from transmitter to receiver, quantifies how efficiently the energy is utilized. Basically, with higher average energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio at the receiver, the packet can be more successfully detected, thus utilizing the spectrum more efficiently, giving higher SE; however, in this case, it requires more energy, lowering EE, and vice versa. In this paper, we study the trade-off between SE and EE, specifically for the cognitive radio considering its configurability. We propose a general metric SEE (Spectral/Energy Efficiency) to facilitate the analysis which quantifies the preference of SE or EE. Closed-form solutions for symbol transmission energy and the length of information bits per frame are obtained for various combined modulation and channel coding schemes. The closed-form solutions further facilitate the adaptivity of cognitive radio considering both SE and EE in various scenarios. Using the proposed metric shows that our scheme is capable to perform balanced trade-off between SE and EE. Considering only maximizing SE, our scheme gains much larger EE while only sacrificing little SE; and comparing with maximizing EE, larger SE can be obtained while sacrificing a small amount EE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666164","htmlLink":"/document/7357450/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio unified Spectral efficiency and Energy Efficiency trade-off analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio unified Spectral efficiency and Energy Efficiency trade-off analysis","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p244wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065519S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7357454,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Lichtman","affiliation":["Wireless Virginia Tech"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Lichtman","id":"37076052900"},{"name":"Jeffrey H.

These types of jammers target MAC or NET layer control messages in an attempt to increase jamming effectiveness and remain harder to detect. ABID systems detect activities that deviate significantly from the normal profile. Signature recognition is based on storing signatures of known intrusion scenarios, and detecting the presence of these signatures in real-time. By choosing a suitable set of features, a high probability of correct detection can be achieved. Our proposed detection strategy involves tracking the statistics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and packet type (critical or non-critical). An alternative strategy that only requires information about packet loss is also provided. Through simulation, we show that these types of jammers can be detected in a large portion of scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357454","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357454.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly-based intrusion detection of protocol-aware jamming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357454/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly-based intrusion detection of protocol-aware jamming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666162","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357454/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly-based intrusion detection of protocol-aware jamming","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p269lichtman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049358S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357456,"authors":[{"name":"Louis Sibomana","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Sibomana","id":"37073315500"},{"name":"Hung Tran","affiliation":["Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Hung Tran","id":"37849318900"},{"name":"Hans-J\u00fcrgen Zepernick","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hans-J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Zepernick","id":"37269932400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357456","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357456","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Security","Signal to noise ratio","Physical layer","Capacity planning","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","multi-access systems","probability","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary network security","primary network","secondary system","secrecy outage probability","nonzero secrecy capacity","multiuser diversity","EAV","eavesdroppers","SU-Rx","SU receivers","SU transmitter","secondary user","PU transmitter","PU receiver","primary user receiver","secondary network physical layer security","primary user interference","cognitive radio networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357456","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357456.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On physical layer security for cognitive radio networks with primary user interference","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the secondary network physical layer security under the outage constraint of the primary user (PU) receiver and interference from the PU transmitter to the secondary network.

However, during rapid deployment missions or rescue operations, one can observe all limitations of traditional approach to spectrum planning. In such scenarios the solution is to use dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technology, which requires operational spectrum environment information and spectrum awareness. In practice, such information can be obtained through the use of cognitive radio (CR) nodes. Assuming that the Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) network is hierarchical and contains a number of cluster heads (CH), the CHs can be used to prepare a Channel Ranking List (CRL) based on spectrum sensing information. CRL is a set of frequencies arranged by CH in a specific order, indicating their usefulness as an alternative channels in case of interference. Unfortunately, the downside of this opportunistic approach is that each CH handles only of its own regular nodes (RN) and itself. It means that any CRL in specific cluster is prepared regardless to the environments of neighboring CHs. To avoid interferences between clusters, CHs should send their CRLs to a network management point, which would enable CRL analysis and coordination. In this paper we focused on the assessment of whether the lack of such coordination has a significant influence on operational capabilities of the CR network and its ability to meet the information exchange requirement, as it is a part of military radio system, and therefore must ensure command services with required quality. To evaluate operational performance of the radio network, we propose to use a command capability factor (C2F).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357480/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15665955","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357480/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed channel selection for hierarchical cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed channel selection for hierarchical cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p426szmit.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056114S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7357482,"authors":[{"name":"Sohraab Soltani","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation.

Then, an improved FastICA algorithm with K-means cluster is designed to separate each weak signal from the mixed weak object signal. We verify the proposed method based on several simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357492","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357492.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"501","endPage":"505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weak signal blind source separation in Passive Radar System with strong interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weak signal blind source separation in Passive Radar System with strong interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357492/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666024","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357492/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weak signal blind source separation in Passive Radar System with strong interference","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p501chengjie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069808S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357494,"authors":[{"name":"John R.

The OFDM transmission signal is designed to simultaneously meet radar target detection and communications signal recovery objectives using training and information symbols on different subcarriers. Given a frequency-selective Rayleigh-distributed fading channel, equally powered and equally spaced training symbols across the occupied bandwidth minimize the mean-square error of the channel estimate, which is tied to a lower bound on ergodic channel capacity.

The fundamental problem is the lack of ideal ambiguity properties of the available waveforms. This is why matched filters are generally suboptimal estimators. Approaches like the instrumental variable filter overcome this problem to a certain extent, but need prior knowledge of the interfering range bins. We take a different approach and show that range imaging can be formulated as a block sparse recovery problem. The block structure arises as the coefficients of the channel matrix of a range bin are either all zero or nonzero. In a second step, high-resolution methods for azimuth estimation can be used. This is in contrast to other sparse recovery approaches in coherent MIMO radar imaging where range, Doppler, and azimuth estimation is performed simultaneously and resolution is limited by coarse grids. We make a first step towards the analysis of sparse recovery based range imaging for coherent MIMO radar by presenting numerical recovery results using iterative algorithms. Our simulation results demonstrate that the channel matrices for all range bins can be estimated reliably, even for a large number of targets.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357495.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"522","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent MIMO radar range imaging with block sparse recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Radar imaging","MIMO radar","Imaging","Channel estimation","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","estimation theory","iterative methods","matched filters","MIMO radar","radar imaging","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent MIMO radar imaging","block sparse recovery","joint estimation","channel matrices","radar scene","matched filters","suboptimal estimators","instrumental variable filter","azimuth estimation","iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","range imaging","sparse recovery","block sparsity","compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coherent MIMO radar range imaging with block sparse recovery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357495/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666106","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent MIMO radar range imaging with block sparse recovery","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p517weiland.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061194S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357497,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua P.

The channels are time aligned and calibrated before beam forming using an internal network for illumination and correction of the elemental electronic channels. This approach lowers the cost of wideband phased arrays by eliminating manual factory tuning. The internal calibration network enables calibration during operation without the implicit electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) concerns of a cooperative radiating source. The approach facilitates correcting for age related changes from the initial factory calibration, and for the inherent factory calibration residual errors. Measured data from an existing 22-phase center elemental digital beam former array was used to evaluate the method. The channel response was extracted and bit error rate (BER) was evaluated using a simulation test bench. The results show two orders of magnitude improvement in BER over a narrow band method based on singular value decomposition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666168","htmlLink":"/document/7357497/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive calibration of wideband digital beam formers with injection calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive calibration of wideband digital beam formers with injection calibration","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p529bruckmeyer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060631S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7357499,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this way, these signals are trapped between surface and duct layer. Thus, atmospheric ducts significantly limit spreading of propagating signals, and provide lower path-loss compared to standard atmosphere even at beyond-Line-of-Sight (b-LoS) ranges. Since duct formation is highly probable in regions with high humidity such as coastal and maritime areas, atmospheric ducts can be used as a communication medium especially for naval beyond-Line-of-Sight (b-LoS) links. Trapping effect of atmospheric ducts provides very narrow angle-of-arrival (AoA) span, thus large planar antenna arrays can be utilized to provide sharp electronically steerable beams.

Phased array technology offers a solution by combining multiple elements together in such a way that their radiation characteristics constructively interfere. Typically, the antenna elements are distributed periodically over lattice grids; however, this can lead to undesirable effects such as scan blindness and surface wave propagation. Instead, randomly distributing the radiators can attain the same performance increases without suffering from the detrimental effects of periodic structures.

In this context, a joint optimization of subcarrier pairing and allocation, relay selection and transmit power allocation is formulated in the OFDMA two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks. Moreover, to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, the energy consumption must be minimized without compromising the QoS. Therefore, by applying convex optimization techniques, energy efficient algorithms are developed with the objective to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing the required data rates.

In this paper, a novel regularized block diagonalization (RBD) precoded MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme with signal space diversity (SSD) is proposed to improve the performance of MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme on the basis of IEEE 802.11ac standard. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the modulation diversity of rotated constellation, the time-frequency diversity of OFDM and the space diversity of MU-MIMO together. Besides, the RBD precoding not only can reduce the interference from other users, but also can decrease the effect of noise. Simulation results show that the proposed RBD-precoded scheme outperforms the conventional bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) scheme without SSD by 3.0dB signal noise ratio (SNR) gain. What's more, the RBD precoding obtains 1.8dB SNR gain than the block diagonalization (BD) precoding.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357503","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357503.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme with the RBD precoding for the next generation WLAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357503/","displayDocTitle":"A novel MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme with the RBD precoding for the next generation WLAN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666227","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357503/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel MU-MIMO-OFDM scheme with the RBD precoding for the next generation WLAN","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p565wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048495S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357504,"authors":[{"name":"Qiongjie Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Qiongjie","lastName":"Lin","id":"37075966300"},{"name":"Mary Ann Weitnauer","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Mary Ann","lastName":"Weitnauer","id":"37073355400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357504","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"abstract":"An energy efficient synchronization method is presented for an OFDM-based Time Division Cooperative Transmission (TDCT) system for the purpose of range extension. The proposed algorithm operates on a novel preamble consisting of two OFDM symbols. In TDCT, copies of the packet are transmitted through different time slots. Exploiting dependence between the synchronization parameters of the different TDCT copies, the approach achieves diversity gain in all estimated synchronization parameters. Since the design and algorithm pertain only to the preamble, the method can be applied to decode-and-forward as well as amplify-and-forward TDCT schemes. This algorithm also offers a significant performance improvement to the single-input-and-single-out (SISO) communication system. Through computer simulation, we show that our novel TDCT approach achieves synchronization in the context of range extension, avoiding the need for more preamble energy.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357504.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"575","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity in synchronization for scheduled OFDM time-division cooperative transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Relays","Frequency-domain analysis","Estimation","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","energy conservation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer simulation","SISO","single-input-and-single-out communication system","amplify-and-forward","decode-and-forward","TDCT","time division cooperative transmission system","energy efficient synchronization","OFDM time-division cooperative transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM synchronization","cooperative transmission","diversity gain","range extension"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Diversity in synchronization for scheduled OFDM time-division cooperative transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357504/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666134","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity in synchronization for scheduled OFDM time-division cooperative transmission","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p570lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045846S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357505,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["Western University, London, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37311294500"},{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["The University of Western Ontario, London, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085520786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357505","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Receivers","OFDM","Communication systems","Transmitters","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","intercarrier interference","jamming","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming attack","jamming signals","intercarrier interference","constellation rotation","nonlinear distortion","wireless OFDM transmission","NAF jamming scheme","nonlinear amplify-and-forward jamming scheme","adversary wireless transmission","disguised jamming"]}],"abstract":"Disguised jamming can be used to disrupt adversary wireless transmission without being noticed. In this paper, a novel nonlinear amplify-and-forward (NAF) jamming scheme is proposed to perform disguised jamming on wireless OFDM transmission, by exploiting the vulnerability of OFDM systems to nonlinear distortion. In the proposed design, the jammer nonlinearly amplifies captured signals and then forwards them to the receiver of the target communication system. Consequently, constellation rotation of the target communication signals, coupled with inter-carrier interference and additional noise, is imposed to the receiver. The OFDM transmission is thus disrupted. As the jamming signals are just a distorted version of the communication signals, which can also be induced by hardware imperfection of the communication system itself, the jamming attack is difficult to detect. Moreover, the proposed jamming scheme requires no information about the communication system and no synchronization to target signals. In addition, it can be easily implemented by analog circuits without any digital signal processing. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed NAF jamming scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disguised jamming against OFDM transmission through nonlinear amplify-and-forward","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357505","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357505.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Disguised jamming against OFDM transmission through nonlinear amplify-and-forward","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357505/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666118","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disguised jamming against OFDM transmission through nonlinear amplify-and-forward","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p576li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057105S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357506,"authors":[{"name":"David Rainnie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Rainnie","id":"37085621868"},{"name":"Yi Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Feng","id":"38247216100"},{"name":"Jan Bajcsy","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Bajcsy"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357506","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":393},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel capacity","Modulation","Yttrium","Frequency division multiplexing","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","frequency division multiplexing","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrally-efficient frequency-division multiplexing systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","OFDM","channel capacity","numerical capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrally-efficient frequency-division multiplexing","non-orthogonal subcarriers","channel capacity","channel modeling","modulation pulse"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores the potential benefit of recently proposed spectrally-efficient frequency-division multiplexing systems (SEFDM), when compared to traditional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

By exploiting the inevitable guard periods between OFDM symbols, i.e., cyclic prefix (CP), the correction component which maintains symbol continuity is aligned with the CP duration after passing through the multipath channel. Thus, the proposed method enables disturbance-free data subcarriers at the receiver while maintaining the continuity of OFDM symbols. This is achieved by the generalization of conventional N-continuous with using more degrees-of-freedom stemming from the CP duration. As it eliminates the interference on the data symbols caused by the correction term, it yields no modification at OFDM receiver, which makes the proposed scheme backward-compatible to conventional OFDM receivers.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357507","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"587","endPage":"592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"N-continuous OFDM with CP alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"N-continuous OFDM with CP alignment","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357507/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666085","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357507/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"N-continuous OFDM with CP alignment","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p587guvenkaya.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042134S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357512,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Delimargas","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Delimargas","id":"38246647200"},{"name":"Emmanouil Skevakis","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Skevakis","id":"37085381883"},{"name":"Hassan Halabian","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Halabian","id":"37400364900"},{"name":"Ioannis Lambadaris","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Lambadaris","id":"37269823000"},{"name":"Nabil Seddigh","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","Solana Networks, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Seddigh","id":"37444728900"},{"name":"Biswajit Nandy","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","Solana Networks, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Biswajit","lastName":"Nandy","id":"37376341400"},{"name":"Rupinder Makkar","affiliation":["Solana Networks, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Rupinder","lastName":"Makkar","id":"37269324200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357512","dbTime":"117 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","IP networks","Fires","Yttrium","Entropy","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","iterative methods","principal component analysis","security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network security","anomaly detection techniques","cyber threat diversity","network anomaly detection statistical methodology","IPCA","iterative PCA method","principal component analysis"]}],"abstract":"As the number, complexity and diversity of cyber threats continue to increase in network infrastructures, anomaly detection techniques constitute a crucial alternative towards enhancing network security. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used network anomaly detection statistical methodology. Despite its ability in detecting traffic anomalies, relevant research has highlighted certain drawbacks of this technique. In our work we develop the Iterative PCA (IPCA) method to address those shortcomings. We aim at providing a useful tool that will enable a network administrator to identify network anomalies. The results of our experimentation are encouraging. They indicate that IPCA possesses promising capabilities in efficiently detecting anomalies while mitigating the limitations of the classical PCA approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IPCA for network anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357512","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357512.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"IPCA for network anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357512/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666037","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IPCA for network anomaly detection","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p617delimargas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078369S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357522,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Amitav","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37291343600"},{"name":"Wenhao Xiong","affiliation":["EECS, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS"],"firstName":"Wenhao","lastName":"Xiong","id":"38269426500"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

The selection criterion is a combination of the number of spatial streams and subchannels as well as transmit power needed by C-UEs to achieve their target data rate.

LTE (Long Term Evolution) is becoming the most widely deployed broadband communication technology making it the technology of choice for public safety to replace TETRA and similar networks. However, LTE is a cellular network by design in that it has planned and fixed antenna locations, and is connected to a common packet core network. Even though the LTE self-organized operation makes the planning, configuration, management, optimization and healing of the network simpler and faster, LTE networks are not well-suited for the moving cell, particularly to establish the backhaul link among the base stations. In this paper we present a novel concept of enhanced evolved Node B (e2NB) to enable meshing of the neighboring e2NBs and maintain the LTE-compliant communication service with the legacy terminals reusing the LTE air interface while moving. We evaluate the performance of the e2NB in terms of backhaul link performance and end-to-end communication using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) LTE implementation. Emulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach to build a self-organized mesh network over LTE/LTE-A. They also show that LTE quality-of-service requirements can be maintained in multi-hop networks subject to resource allocation across multiple e2NBs.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357525.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"700","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 -

In this paper, we present first results of a 3D outdoor propagation channel measurement campaign performed in an urban macro-cellular environment. The measurements were performed with a 20 MHz wideband polarimetric MIMO channel sounder centered at 2.53 GHz. At each measurement location, parameters of all MPCs observed were extracted with RIMAX, an iterative maximum likelihood high-resolution algorithm. It was observed that MPCs naturally grouped into clusters. We then present a cluster-based analysis of the propagation channel providing some results of the intra and inter cluster parameters and their relevant statistics. Correlation between all extracted cluster parameters are also provided. Parameters such as elevation and azimuth spread (at the base-station) in this work have been used as input to recent international channel model standardization.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357533","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357533.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-based analysis of 3D MIMO channel measurement in an urban environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357533/","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-based analysis of 3D MIMO channel measurement in an urban environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357533/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-based analysis of 3D MIMO channel measurement in an urban environment","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p744sangodoyin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076681S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357538,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Ryu","affiliation":["EpiSys Science Inc., Poway, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37085444235"},{"name":"Nadeesha Ranasinghe","affiliation":["EpiSys Science Inc., Poway, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nadeesha","lastName":"Ranasinghe","id":"37869244400"},{"name":"Wei-Min Shen","affiliation":["EpiSys Science Inc., Boulder View Dr. Poway, CA 92064 USA"],"firstName":"Wei-Min","lastName":"Shen","id":"37277735600"},{"name":"Kurt Turck","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Turck","id":"37085644042"},{"name":"Michael Muccio","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Muccio","id":"37085647196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357538","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Ad hoc networks","Collaboration","Mobile communication","Communication networks","Wireless communication","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","biomimetics","sensor placement","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensor network","collaborative sensing","digital hormones","radio signal mapping","airborne node swarm coordination","hormone based communication","dynamic communication network","unmanned aerial vehicle","airborne communication node coordination","BioAIR system","bio-inspired airborne infrastructure reconfiguration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Command and control systems","Communication networks","Decentralized control","Distributed algorithms","Intelligent Robots","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"Maintaining constant communication between mobile entities distributed across a large geographical area is a crucial task for many commercial and military applications. For example when troops are deployed in hostile or sensor deprived environments, maintaining radio contact with a base station would increase the efficiency of coordinating the deployment, yet maintaining communications should not interfere with the primary tasks of these entities. The BioAIR system was developed to coordinate airborne communication nodes such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in order to autonomously form and maintain a dynamic communication network. This system draws upon inspirations from biological cell differentiation through hormone based communication to coordinate a swarm of airborne nodes in a distributed manner by mapping the radio signals into digital hormones. BioAIR offers three primary capabilities, namely collaborative communication, sensing and navigation. BioAIR performs collaborative communication by autonomously creating a mobile ad-hoc network. This network connects several designated nodes by strategically positioning other nodes based on the desired communication signal quality between them. BioAIR performs collaborative sensing by autonomously reinforcing critical locations based on network traffic, detecting any damage to the formed network, and self-repairing. Additionally, BioAIR can coordinate the sensing effort of possibly heterogeneous sensors distributed amongst all nodes in the network to form a distributed sensor network. BioAIR performs collaborative navigation by following the motion of designated nodes while maintaining the formed communication network, provided that the nodes can react fast enough.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357538","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357538.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BioAIR: Bio-inspired airborne infrastructure reconfiguration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357538/","displayDocTitle":"BioAIR: Bio-inspired airborne infrastructure reconfiguration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666044","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357538/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BioAIR: Bio-inspired airborne infrastructure reconfiguration","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p774ryu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055542S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357540,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichuan Huang","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore"],"firstName":"Zhichuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085654579"},{"name":"David Corrigan","affiliation":["State University of New York, Binghamton"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Corrigan","id":"37266144800"},{"name":"Sandeep Narayanan","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37085652313"},{"name":"Ting Zhu","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085638448"},{"name":"Elizabeth Bentley","affiliation":["Air Force Research Lab"],"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Bentley","id":"37605484500"},{"name":"Michael Medley","affiliation":["Air Force Research Lab"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Medley","id":"37347322400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357540","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Base stations","Trajectory","Military aircraft","Prediction algorithms","Bandwidth","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","military communication","radio spectrum management","telecommunication scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed spectrum management","dynamic spectrum management","airborne network","air force operation","limited wireless communication spectrum","limited latency","rapidly-changing topologies","base station","channel quality uncertainty","long-term channel statistics","real-time channel states","channel quality prediction","channel quality correlation","task scheduling","aircraft","channel utilization"]}],"abstract":"Airborne network plays an important role in operations of Air Force. Due to the rapidly-changing topologies, limited wireless communication spectrum, latency, and priorities of tasks, it is vitally important to have dynamic spectrum management between aircrafts and base station in airborne networks. Particularly, we encounter two major challenges: (1) uncertainty about channel quality, in terms of the long-term channel statistics and real-time channel states; (2) the dynamics and the possibly correlated nature of channel quality of different aircrafts. To address these two challenges, we propose a distributed framework for spectrum management in airborne networks, which includes: 1) channel quality prediction based on correlation of channel quality among aircrafts; 2) task scheduling in the aircraft. With real-world trace data, we conduct extensive experiments. Our simulation results show that our design can effectively optimize the channel utilization in airborne network.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357540","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"786","endPage":"791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed and dynamic spectrum management in airborne networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed and dynamic spectrum management in airborne networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357540/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666013","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357540/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed and dynamic spectrum management in airborne networks","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p786huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068636S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357541,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Zhu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNlist), Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37073400300"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNlist), Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, UK"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37555483600"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNlist), Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"},{"name":"Marc Moonen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Katholieke University, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moonen","id":"37274397700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357541","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Channel estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Correlation","Delays","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","correlation methods","iterative methods","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic sparse channel","differential orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","broadband wireless communication system","probabilistic signal model","temporal correlations","path delays","path gains","D-OMP algorithm","channel variation"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of tracking a dynamic sparse channel in a broadband wireless communication system.

However, conventional channel estimation schemes for TDS-OFDM systems suffer from the obvious performance loss in high-speed scenarios. In this paper, by exploiting the temporal correlation of wireless channels, we propose a sparse channel estimation scheme to improve the channel estimation performance for TDS-OFDM systems in high-speed scenarios. Specifically, we first propose an overlap-add method of the received time-domain training sequences (TSs) to acquire the rough channel estimation, whereby the temporal correlation of wireless channels is exploited to improve the estimation performance of time-varying channels. Then, a priori information aided matching pursuit (PIA-MP) algorithm is proposed to acquire the accurate channel estimation with low complexity, whereby the priori information from the rough channel estimation is utilized to further improve the channel estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art schemes in high-speed scenarios, especially under severe multipath channels with long delay spread.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal correlation based sparse channel estimation for TDS-OFDM in high-speed scenarios","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357542","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357542.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Temporal correlation based sparse channel estimation for TDS-OFDM in high-speed scenarios","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357542/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666184","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal correlation based sparse channel estimation for TDS-OFDM in high-speed scenarios","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p798gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144131S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357544,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chieh Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Applied Science and Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wei-Chieh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085443224"},{"name":"Jenq-Tay Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Jenq-Tay","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37351655900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357544","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","IIR filters","Blind equalizers","Filtering algorithms","Decision feedback equalizers","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","adaptive filters","blind equalisers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive blind equalizer","whitening filter","BE","constant modulus algorithm","CMA","WF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind equalization","constant modulus algorithm (CMA)","minimum output energy (MOE) criterion","whitening filter (WF)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive blind equalizers with whitening filters","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","endPage":"814","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357544","startPage":"809","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357544","abstract":"Owing to the multimodality of the constant modulus (CM) cost surfaces, poor initializations of the adaptive blind equalizer (BE) employing the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) may converge to undesired local minima, thus preventing the adaptive BE from opening eye.

In this paper, we present results on the maximum information rate (denoted as \u201ccapacity\u201d hereafter) of MIMO transmission with LR-aided equalizers employed at the receiver. First, we derive the main steps for calculating the capacity with different equalizers. Then, we illustrate the capacity when LR-aided equalizers are adopted. We show that the capacity gap between maximum likelihood equalizer (MLE) and LR-aided LEs is linked to the orthogonality deficiency (od) of the dual of the lattice-reduced channel matrix. Although LR-aided LEs do not guarantee to improve capacity every channel realization, we give the conditions when the ergodic capacity of LR-aided LEs is greater than that of LEs, as well as when their outage diversity is the same as that of MLE. Lastly, we show numerical examples with several state-of-the-art LR algorithms to corroborate the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357554","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357554.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis of lattice reduction aided equalizers for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357554/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity analysis of lattice reduction aided equalizers for MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357554/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity analysis of lattice reduction aided equalizers for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p866ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067208S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357555,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Xu","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085639337"},{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085421038"},{"name":"Limin Xiao","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37367806200"},{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278218100"},{"name":"Shidong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shidong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085377352"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085374957"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357555","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","MIMO","Array signal processing","Silicon","Approximation methods","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convex programming","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficient distributed beamforming","multiple full-duplex MIMO relays","multiple input multiple output relay","including self interference","multiuser interference","interrelay interference","interference suppression","successive convex approximation","proximal point method"]}],"abstract":"Full-duplex multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relaying is capable of providing coverage for remote users with low power consumption, by exploiting the spatial dimensions of MIMO to suppress different types of interference, including self interference (SI) and multi-user interference (MUI). In a general network with multiple full-duplex MIMO relays, inter-relay interference (IRI) emerges and degrades system performance by consuming excessive transmit power. In this paper, distributed beamforming is investigated for interference suppression in multiple full-duplex MIMO relay network. Based on successive convex approximation and proximal point method, a distributed beamforming algorithm is proposed to suppress the three types of interference jointly, with the target of minimizing total transmit power under individual user rate constraints. The proposed iterative algorithm requires only local information exchange at the relays, which reduces the signaling overhead in largescale networks. An upper bound of the stepsizes that guarantee convergence is also given. Simulation results are presented to validate effectiveness of our proposal.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357555","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"872","endPage":"877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-efficient distributed beamforming for multiple full-duplex MIMO relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power-efficient distributed beamforming for multiple full-duplex MIMO relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357555/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666183","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-efficient distributed beamforming for multiple full-duplex MIMO relays","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p872xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063942S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357556,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana"],"lastName":"Jun Chen","id":"37076889300"},{"name":"Thomas Pratt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Pratt","id":"37279224700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357556","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","linear codes","MIMO communication","mobile radio","precoding","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel state information","packet-based multiple-input and multiple-output system","mobile station transmitter","energy efficiency","mobile industry","battery-powered devices","linearly precoded MIMO systems","energy-efficient transmission"]}],"abstract":"Energy-efficient transmission of battery-powered devices is becoming more important in the mobile industry to improve device communications times on a battery charge.

At the surface, the interference environment is dominated by the atmospheric noise, which is highly impulsive in character and may impede the reception of the radio signals. To handle the demanding channel and the impulsive interference environment, error correction and an adapted receiver are necessary. In this paper, we propose a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) as soft output from the demodulator suitable for atmospheric noise. The radio system is assumed to use minimum shift keying (MSK) and a low parity density check (LDPC) code. It is shown that the proposed interference-adapted LLR improves the performance substantially in atmospheric noise compared to when the LLR is designed for AWGN. The performance is also compared to a solution, where the soft output from the demodulator is simplified to a limiter, and to a solution when a larger system bandwidth is used in combination with a limiter. It is concluded that the proposed interference-adapted LLR achieves the best performance in the comparison, although the performance could probably be further improved, when compared to the obtained Shannon capacity of this particular interference.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357596","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A log-likelihood ratio for improved receiver performance for VLF/LF communication in atmospheric noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A log-likelihood ratio for improved receiver performance for VLF/LF communication in atmospheric noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666201","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A log-likelihood ratio for improved receiver performance for VLF/LF communication in atmospheric noise","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1120wiklundh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066241S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357598,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Annavajjala","affiliation":["Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Annavajjala","id":"37275183100"},{"name":"Christopher C.

With a spectrum sharing operating mode, it is hard to model dynamic interference conditions in wireless networks. In the first part of this work, we have introduced an additive non-Gaussian channel (ANGC) model that captures a variety of interference sources, and presented average mutual information and average probability of error expressions when the receiver has perfect channel estimates and no knowledge of the noise statistics. The primary goal of introducing this model is to compactly represent a wide range of non-Gaussian noise sources in a robust and simple manner. As a continuation of that work, in this paper, we consider the problem of noise variance estimation, signal detection with pilot-assisted channel estimation (PACE), and coded sequence detection with a mismatched decoding metric. We derive the joint maximum-likelihood estimates of the Gaussian noise variance and the non-Gaussian parameter, and expressions for the outage probability and the average bit error probability for uncoded binary signaling. We also derive expressions for the average pairwise error probability with coding and PACE on ANGC. Numerical and simulation results are presented to validate the analysis presented in this paper.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357598.pdf","endPage":"1137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication over non-Gaussian channels - Part II: Channel estimation, mismatched receivers, and error performance with coding","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357598","startPage":"1132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Communication over non-Gaussian channels - Part II: Channel estimation, mismatched receivers, and error performance with coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357598/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666217","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357598/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication over non-Gaussian channels - Part II: Channel estimation, mismatched receivers, and error performance with coding","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1132annavajjala.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044576S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7357599,"authors":[{"name":"Abigail Fuentes-Rivera","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Abigail","lastName":"Fuentes-Rivera","id":"38275415900"},{"name":"Mingjie Lin","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Mingjie","lastName":"Lin","id":"37421151000"},{"name":"Hector M Lugo-Cordero","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Hector M","lastName":"Lugo-Cordero","id":"38270147800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357599","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357599","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Hardware","Approximation algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Gabor filters","Stochastic processes","Root mean square"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gabor filters","particle swarm optimisation","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial functions","state-machines","Gaussian functions","differential evolution method","particle swarm optimization algorithm","novel evolutionary stochastic technique","Gabor filter polynomial approximation"]}],"abstract":"A new particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been developed, and combined with the differential evolution (DE) method.

Grouping two users in a single beam to serve users in a non-orthogonal fashion raises multi-user interference (MUI). To tackle this problem, the clustering algorithm considers the channel correlation to select users aligned with same direction. Furthermore, the channel gain is also reflected in the clustering algorithm to enhance signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) inspired by the fact that the optimal precoding matrix is less sensitive to channel direction. Optimization algorithm over the precoding matrix is proposed based on Majorization Minimization (MM) approach for a non-convex objective function.

An optimal iterative beamforming design is utilized to the NOMA scheme. The weighted sum rate is used as the objective criterion to design the beamforming matrix at the base station (BS). The users in a typical cluster located in the same radiation beam are precoded in the same weighting factors. We propose an algorithm to schedule the users into clusters to achieve a higher sum-rate. The signals of users in one cluster are precoded in the NOMA scheme. The successive interference cancelation (SIC) technique is used at the receiver to extract the desired signal from a superposition signal. To take advantage of the SIC, a power allocation algorithm is proposed to further increase the sum-rate of this system and guarantee the performance of users with the weak channel condition.

We evaluate the over-the-air performance of recently designed minimum total squared correlation (MinTSC) signature sets compared to maximal length pseudorandom binary spreading sequences (m/PN) under a variety of interference conditions. Pre-calculated MinTSC and PN databases feed into a direct sequence Code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) framework capable of emulating a synchronous multi-user scenario. The framework is constructed in GNU radio and implemented on USRP N210 software-defined radios (SDRs). Packet error rate of a data transfer was measured under varying interference conditions. Signature length, interference profile type and interferer power were varied for both MinTSC and PN signature sets. We address transceiver design and implementation challenges including a two-step acquisition and tracking approach to address the difficulties of preamble synchronization. Under single tone (impulse) interference at the center frequency, MinTSC signature sets experience packet errors primarily on the first signature whereas all PN signatures see errors. Under wide-band interference, individual MinTSC signatures perform more uniformly compared to PN. Understanding of this behavior under varying interference provides the warfighter with greater flexibility to adapt to new conditions and can drive assignment of priority data to specific signatures.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357609","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357609.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Over-the-air performance of spectrally-efficient CDMA signature sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357609/","displayDocTitle":"Over-the-air performance of spectrally-efficient CDMA signature sets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666130","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357609/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Over-the-air performance of spectrally-efficient CDMA signature sets","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1200saji.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042677S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357621,"authors":[{"name":"William Luis","affiliation":["Microsemi Corporation - SoC Group, San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Luis","id":"37085673218"},{"name":"G.

In military vehicular networks, it is vital to prevent adversaries from manipulating critical messages via cryptographic protection (e.g., digital signatures) and at the same time to minimize the impact introduced by crypto operations (e.g., delay). Hence, their communication must be delay-aware, scalable and secure. In this paper, we developed Hardware-Accelerated Authentication (HAA) that enables practical realization of delay-aware signatures for vehicular networks. Specifically, we developed a cryptographic hardware-acceleration framework for Rapid Authentication (RA) [1], which is a delay-aware offline-online signature scheme for command and control systems. We showed that HAA can significantly improve the performance of offline-online constructions under high message throughput, which is an important property for vehicular networks. HAA-2048 (GPU) is \u00d718, \u00d76, and \u00d73 times faster than the current CPU implementation of RSA, ECDSA and RA, respectively, for the same level of security.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357624","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357624.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HAA: Hardware-Accelerated Authentication for internet of things in mission critical vehicular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HAA: Hardware-Accelerated Authentication for internet of things in mission critical vehicular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357624/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666084","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357624/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAA: Hardware-Accelerated Authentication for internet of things in mission critical vehicular networks","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1298singla.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096875S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357628,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchong Li","affiliation":["Air Defence Forces Academy of PLA Zhengzhou, China","National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological Research Center"],"lastName":"Yuchong Li","id":"37085614674"},{"name":"Xingguo Luo","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological Research Center"],"lastName":"Xingguo Luo","id":"37554028400"},{"name":"Bainan Li","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological Research Center"],"lastName":"Bainan Li","id":"37085636024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357628","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"abstract":"Detecting network anomalies means a lot to network security. In respect of detection precision and range, network-wide anomaly detection approaches on the basis of traffic flows have distinctive advantages over the methods of the traditional host computer, single link and single path. However, these approaches face actual problems of performance reduction or being unavailable when noise interference or data loss take place. In order to solve these problems, anomaly detection algorithm based on robust multivariate probabilistic calibration model is proposed. This algorithm establishes a normal traffic model of traffic matrix based on the latent variable probability model of multivariate t-distribution, and implements network anomaly detection by judging if the sample's Mahalanobis distance exceeds the threshold. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate its robustness and wider use. The algorithm is applicable when dealing with both data integrity and loss. It also has a stronger resistance over noise interference and lower sensitivity to the change of parameters, all of which indicate its performance stability.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 -

SECANT combines multiuser multiple-input multiple output (MU-MIMO), multiuser detection (MUD), and interference alignment (IA) methods at the PHY layer such that spectrum efficiency can be improved in both interference and signal spaces. An adaptive medium access control (MAC) mechanism is developed to enable spectrum efficiency gains at the PHY layer by managing concurrent transmissions and interference levels.

One such hurdle is the alignment of the steerable mmWave antenna array. This paper quantifies both the ergodic capacity of a mmWave ad hoc network with perfect alignment and the loss in ergodic capacity when error is introduced. First, we leverage stochastic geometry to evaluate the ergodic capacity (bits/sec/Hz/area) in the network. Next, we compare two antenna models that are commonly used: sectored and Gaussian. Lastly, we derive expressions that quantify the loss in ergodic capacity per user when alignment error occurs at the receiver and transmitter. Our results show that even relatively small errors in alignment can lead to significant ergodic capacity reduction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15666025","htmlLink":"/document/7357653/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic capacity in mmWave ad hoc network with imperfect beam alignment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic capacity in mmWave ad hoc network with imperfect beam alignment","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1479thornburg.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044864S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7357655,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Simulation results show that by using the proposed sampling instance, the BER obtained by the PSP algorithm with DFSE is improved by about 2dB in terms of SNR.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357658","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1514","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357658.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-channel blind separation of co-frequency MPSK signals based on PSP algorithm with DFSE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Single-channel blind separation of co-frequency MPSK signals based on PSP algorithm with DFSE","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357658/","accessionNumber":"15666009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357658/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-channel blind separation of co-frequency MPSK signals based on PSP algorithm with DFSE","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1509liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05722S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7357674,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Gunduzhan","affiliation":["JHU/APL, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Gunduzhan","id":"37085706843"},{"name":"Bharat Doshi","affiliation":["JHU/APL, US Army CERDEC, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Bharat","lastName":"Doshi","id":"37357720300"},{"name":"Lotfi Benmohamed","affiliation":["JMU/APL"],"firstName":"Lotfi","lastName":"Benmohamed","id":"37265474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357674","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357674","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geology","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Measurement","Poles and towers","Integrated circuits","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","cellular radio","emergency management","filters","mobility management (mobile radio)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular broadcast channel","geotargeting schemes","notification latency","radio resource requirements","cell broadcast message","mobile devices","IPAWS","integrated public alert and warnings system","dissemination channels","cell phones","geographically-targeted alerts","cell towers","public safety system","mobile location aware emergency notification","WEA","wireless emergency alerts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emergency services","cellular networks","public alerts","mobile communications"]}],"abstract":"Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) is a public safety system that uses broadcast from cell towers to send geographically-targeted alerts and warnings to cell phones. It is one of the dissemination channels for the Integrated Public Alert and Warnings System (IPAWS). WEA typically broadcasts an alert in the cells with at least some portion affected by the emergency event. When the affected area includes only portions of one or more cells, there could be a high proportion of False Positives (people who should not have been notified get the message on their cell phones) and/or False Negatives (people who should have been notified but are not notified). We propose a scheme that uses the mobile devices' knowledge of their own location and the target area described in the cell broadcast message to filter the messages in the cell phone and notify the user only when the mobile device's estimated location is within the target area. We evaluate the new scheme in terms of false negatives and positives, radio resource requirements, and notification latency, and compare it with various other geotargeting schemes. We also discuss mechanisms to communicate the target area information efficiently in the limited bandwidth available in cellular broadcast channel. Finally, we discuss ways for allowing a broader set of contexts to determine whether a user should be notified of a given emergency.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357674","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357674.pdf","startPage":"1606","endPage":"1611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Emergency Alerts in arbitrary sized target areas: Mobile location aware emergency notification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Emergency Alerts in arbitrary sized target areas: Mobile location aware emergency notification","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357674/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666197","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357674/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Emergency Alerts in arbitrary sized target areas: Mobile location aware emergency notification","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1606gunduzhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047307S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7357681,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Enserink","affiliation":["Trelliswork Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Enserink","id":"37541442800"},{"name":"Cenk K\u00f6se","affiliation":["Trelliswork Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Cenk","lastName":"K\u00f6se","id":"37283425600"},{"name":"Mike Fitz","affiliation":["Trelliswork Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Fitz","id":"37269771600"},{"name":"Marcus Urie","affiliation":["Trelliswork Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Urie","id":"37990522400"},{"name":"Ryan McCourt","affiliation":["Trelliswork Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"McCourt","id":"37085617131"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0073-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357681","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"abstract":"The ionosphere has two modes of propagation, each with a different polarization. Theory and measurements show that the paths associated with these two polarization modes have independent fades. Transmitting and receiving on two co-located orthogonal linear polarized antennas 1) makes the link more robust to fading, 2) removes possibility of polarization loss, 3) can nearly double the data throughput by effectively establishing two links, and 4) is a form of multiple input multiple output communications (MIMO). This paper introduces a simple and flexible model for a dual polarized (DP) HF MIMO channel, illustrates how to develop specific instantiations of the model based on channel measurements, including ionosondes, and presents some performance comparisons between single input single output HF communications and DP HF MIMO. A contribution of this paper is the introduction of this flexible DP HF MIMO channel model that will allow researchers to develop instantiations of HF DP channel models from readily available ionosonde data and determine the performance benefits of HF DP MIMO under a variety of ionospheric propagation conditions and antenna orientations.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357681.pdf","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1655","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model for dual polarized HF MIMO communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Ionosphere","Receiving antennas","Correlation","Channel models","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear antennas","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HF MIMO communications","ionosphere","orthogonal linear polarized antennas","polarization loss","multiple input multiple output communications","dual polarized HF MIMO channel","channel measurements","ionosondes","DP HF MIMO channel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A model for dual polarized HF MIMO communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357681/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15666163","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for dual polarized HF MIMO communications","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1650enserink.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060645S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357682,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

For civil UAS that must share airspace with piloted aircraft, safety is paramount. Hence, requirements for a highly-reliable control and non-payload communication (CNPC) link are under development. Since designing a reliable link requires accurate knowledge of the channel characteristics, validated models for the air-ground (AG) channel are essential. In this paper we report results of SIMO AG measurements made for a NASA project in a near-urban environment (Cleveland, OH), for the two bands recently allocated for civil UAS CNPC: L-band (~970 MHz) and C-band (~5.06 GHz). Example channel characteristics are provided for a single flight track. For this flight track, path loss exponents were found to be 1.6 in L-band and 1.9 in C-band. Small scale fading Ricean K factors were 13 dB in L-band and 27 dB in C-band. The C-band root mean square delay spread was approximately 10 ns for most of the time, but reached 180 ns when reflections from buildings in the urban area were present. Spatial and inter-band correlation statistics are also reported. Tapped delay line models for near-urban AG channels will be presented in the near future.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["L-band","Delays","Antennas","Antenna measurements","Correlation","Aircraft","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","correlation methods","least mean squares methods","mobile communication","Rician channels","statistical analysis","synchronisation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tapped delay line models","interband correlation statistics","spatial correlation statistics","C-band root mean square delay spread","fading Ricean K factors","path loss exponents","flight track","L-band","civil UAS CNPC","Cleveland OH","NASA project","SIMO AG measurements","reliable link","CNPC link","control and nonpayload communication link","airspace","drones","unmanned aircraft systems","AG channel","air-ground channel characterization","time 180 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAS","CNPC","air-ground channel","urban environment","MIMO","path loss","delay spread","Ricean K factor","spatial correlation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357682","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357682","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347040/7357245/07357682.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357682","startPage":"1656","endPage":"1660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357245","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Air-ground channel characterization for unmanned aircraft systems: The near-urban environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Air-ground channel characterization for unmanned aircraft systems: The near-urban environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357682/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7357682/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15665962","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Air-ground channel characterization for unmanned aircraft systems: The near-urban environment","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p1656matolak.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047274S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347040","isNumber":"7357245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347040","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7357245","articleId":"7357682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7357727,"authors":[{"name":"Bane Vasi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bane","lastName":"Vasi\u0107","id":"37274466600"},{"name":"Predrag Ivani\u0161","affiliation":["University of Belgrade, Serbia, School of Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Ivani\u0161","id":"37296558800"},{"name":"Srdan Brkic","affiliation":["University of Belgrade, Serbia, School of Electrical Engineering"],"firstName":"Srdan","lastName":"Brkic","id":"37085458183"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7516-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7515-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7514-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7357727","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7357727","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Logic gates","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","memory architecture","parity check codes","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check code","LDPC codes","low complexity memory architectures","information storage problem","memory cells","memory reliability","memory content","error correction scheme","state-of-the memory architectures"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we investigate the problem of information storage in inherently unreliable memory cells.

The constructed FNN has the regularizing parameters (weights and biases), which can be utilized to make the error function minimal. The construction of the model leads to the satisfaction of the initial and boundary conditions along with the training of FNN which satisfies the PDEs. Numerical experiments with comparisons exhibits the superior behavior of this technique. We have displayed that the proposed algorithm is much more effective than the other numerical method that confers solutions with good universalization and high precision.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357914","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347854/7357811/07357914.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network approach for solving strongly degenerate parabolic and burgers-fisher equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network approach for solving strongly degenerate parabolic and burgers-fisher equations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15667902","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7357914/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network approach for solving strongly degenerate parabolic and burgers-fisher equations","confLoc":"Mexico City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057891S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347854","isNumber":"7357811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347854","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7357811","articleId":"7357914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7357924,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

To demonstrate the FPGA realization, we use a mix of three sinusoidal signals, which represents three independent sources, with 1000Hz, 800Hz and 600Hz values in frequency. The mixed signal is treated by the ICA system. The digital system in FPGA was analyzed first in Simulink of Matlab, evaluating its performance. Then, the FPGA architecture, which was optimized observing a multiplexing scheme, is proposed where the number of used DSP resources is minimal. This leads to extend this multiplexing scheme to cover future designs with more signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357924","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347854/7357811/07357924.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7357811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7357924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of the ICA algorithm using multiplexing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15667829","htmlLink":"/document/7357924/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of the ICA algorithm using multiplexing","confLoc":"Mexico City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079697S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7347854","isNumber":"7357811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347854","xplore-issue":"7357811","articleId":"7357924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7357973,"authors":[{"name":"Ramiro De Santiago L\u00f3pez","affiliation":["CINVESTAV Tamaulipas, Information Technology Laboratory, Tamaulipas, MEXICO"],"firstName":"Ramiro","lastName":"De Santiago L\u00f3pez","id":"37085707644"},{"name":"J.

The antenna array is composed of four identical CP antenna elements and one parallel strip-line feeding network. Each of CP antenna elements comprises a dipole and a zero-phase-shift (ZPS) line loop. The in-phase fed dipole and the ZPS line loop generate vertically and horizontally polarized omnidirectional radiation, respectively. Furthermore, the vertically polarized dipole is positioned in the center of the horizontally polarized ZPS line loop. The size of the loop is designed such that a 90\u00b0 phase difference is realized between the two orthogonal components because of the spatial difference and, therefore, generates CP omnidirectional radiation. A 1 \u00d7 4 antenna array at 900 MHz is prototyped and targeted to ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) applications. The measurement results show that the antenna array achieves a 10-dB return loss over a frequency range of 900-935 MHz and 3-dB axial-ratio (AR) from 890 to 930 MHz. At the frequency of 915 MHz, the measured maximum AR of 1.53 dB, maximum gain of 5.4 dBic, and an omnidirectionality of \u00b11 dB are achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7396973/07358028.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2509009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2509009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Omnidirectional Circularly Polarized Antenna Array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Antenna arrays","Arrays","Gain","Dielectric resonator antennas","Radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","dipole antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","omnidirectional antennas","radiofrequency identification","strip lines","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency 890 MHz to 930 MHz","frequency 900 MHz to 935 MHz","loss 10 dB","omnidirectional circularly polarized antenna array","CP antenna array","CP antenna elements","parallel strip-line feeding network","zero-phase-shift line loop","ZPS line loop","CP omnidirectional radiation","radio frequency identification","ultra-high frequency RFID","UHF RFID","return loss","axial-ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array","circularly polarized (CP) antenna","omnidirectional antenna","RFID","UHF","zero-phase-shift loop"]},{"kwd":["Antenna array","circularly polarized (CP) antenna","omnidirectional antenna","radio frequency identification (RFID)","ultra-high frequency (UHF)","zero-phase-shift (ZPS) loop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Omnidirectional Circularly Polarized Antenna Array","volume":"64","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7358028/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755286","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)","grantNumber":"092 154 0097"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471209"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012657"},{"fundingName":"Six types of Talents Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"2013-XXRJ-010"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Program of the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K201415"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Omnidirectional Circularly Polarized Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"tap-shi-2509009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071562S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7396973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7396973","articleId":"7358028","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358030,"authors":[{"name":"Li Dong","affiliation":["SKLSDE, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7405367/7358030/7358030-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Dong is a postgraduate student at Beihang University and University of Edinburgh.

The main difference among these models lies in the composition function, i.e., how to obtain the vector representation for a phrase or sentence using the representations of words it contains. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive Multi-Compositionality (AdaMC) layer to recursive neural network models. The basic idea is to use more than one composition function and adaptively select them depending on input vectors. We develop a general framework to model the semantic composition as a distribution of these composition functions. The composition functions and parameters used for adaptive selection are jointly learnt from the supervision of specific tasks. We integrate AdaMC into existing recursive neural network models and conduct extensive experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and semantic relation classification task. The experimental results demonstrate that AdaMC improves the performance of recursive neural network models and outperforms the baseline methods.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2509257","startPage":"422","endPage":"431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7405367/07358030.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2015.2509257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multi-Compositionality for Recursive Neural Network Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Neural networks","Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Syntactics","Tensile stress","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multicompositionality","recursive neural network models","natural language processing tasks","AdaMC layer","Stanford sentiment treebank","semantic relation classification task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compositionality","neural network","recursive neural network (RNN)","semantic composition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multi-Compositionality for Recursive Neural Network Models","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7358030/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15786300","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Lab of Software Development Environment","grantNumber":"SKLSDE-2015ZX-05"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61421003"},{"fundingName":"Microsoft Research Fund","grantNumber":"FY15-RES-OPP-112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multi-Compositionality for Recursive Neural Network Models","sourcePdf":"taslp-wei-2509257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120838S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7405367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7405367","articleId":"7358030","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7358039,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7358039/chen-2509013-small.gif","p":["Xiao Chen received the Ph.D. degree in computing science from Newcastle University, in 2013.

An efficient patient flow can improve the quality of services and the utilization of resources. A smart environment could facilitate the experience of individuals within a physical space, such as a hospital. Meanwhile, a smart healthcare environment could improve patient flow through an efficient scheduling policy and the utilization of healthcare resources by an optimized capacity plan. This paper, first, explores a dynamic scheduling policy to improve the patient flow, and an efficient capacity scheme based on the varying patient flow. This scheduling policy and the capacity scheme can be built in a smart hospital environment through wireless sensor networks and smart healthcare systems. The research applies a formal modeling approach that can provide a quantitative analysis of systems. This approach, performance evaluation process algebra, can give strict definitions for the patient flow in order to model the dynamic scheduling policy and the capacity scheme; moreover, it provides a scalable performance analysis by the fluid flow approximation.

This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam steering, and wide bandwidth. This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38-patch and 28-slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2U CubeSats. This is because of its small size (34 \u00d7 13 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) and high gain (7.3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide -10-dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of -15.2 dB.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07358040.pdf","startPage":"2590","endPage":"2612","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2506577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2506577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey and Study of Planar Antennas for Pico-Satellites","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"A Survey and Study of Planar Antennas for Pico-Satellites","htmlLink":"/document/7358040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15638765","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey and Study of Planar Antennas for Pico-Satellites","sourcePdf":"access-tubbal-2506577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154618S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7358040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7358042,"authors":[{"name":"Mirza Golam Kibria","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7563473/7358042/kibri-2509259-small.gif","p":["Mirza Golam Kibria (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Visveswaraiah Technological University (VTU), Belgaum, India, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree from the Lund Institute of Technology (LTH), Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2014.","He is currently with the Wireless Network Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Japan, as a Researcher.

The downlink transmission capacity of the cognitive M2M system is thereby maximized, while keeping the interference introduced to the primary users (PUs) below the prespecified threshold, under total transmit power budget of the secondary base station (SBS). The performance of UF-OFDM-based CR system is compared to the performances of OFDM-based and filter bank multicarrier (FBMC)-based CR systems. We also propose a near-optimal resource allocation method separating the sub-band and power allocation. The solution is less complex compared to optimization of the original combinatorial problem. We present numerical results that show that for given interference thresholds of the PUs and maximum transmit power limit of the SBS, the UF-OFDM-based CR system exhibits intermediary performance in terms of achievable capacity compared to OFDM- and FBMC-based CR systems. Interestingly, for a certain degree of robustness of the PUs, the UF-OFDM performs equally well as FBMC. Furthermore, the percentage rate-gain of UF-OFDM-based CR system increases by a large amount when UF-OFDM modulation with lower sidelobes ripple is employed. Numerical results also show that the proposed throughput enhancing method despite having lower computational complexity compared to the optimal solution achieves near-optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2509259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7563473/07358042.pdf","startPage":"830","endPage":"838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2509259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7563473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Enhancement of Multicarrier Cognitive M2M Networks: Universal-Filtered OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358042/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Enhancement of Multicarrier Cognitive M2M Networks: Universal-Filtered OFDM Systems","volume":"3","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16286977","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358042/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Enhancement of Multicarrier Cognitive M2M Networks: Universal-Filtered OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"jiot-kibria-2509259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111256S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7563473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7563473","articleId":"7358042","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358044,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Liu","affiliation":["Futurewei Technologies, Inc., Huawei R&D USA, Bridgewater, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xiang Liu (M\u201900\u2013SM\u201905) received the\n Ph.D. degree in applied physics from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2000.

We review recent progresses on the use of frequency-division multiplexing to achieve highly bandwidth-efficient mobile fronthaul with low latency. We present digital signal processing (DSP) techniques for channel aggregation and deaggregation, frequency-domain windowing, adjacent channel leak age ratio reduction, and synchronous transmission of both the I/Q waveforms of wireless signals and the control words (CWs) used for control and management purposes. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate the transmission of 48 20-MHz LTE signals with a common public radio interface (CPRI) equivalent data rate of 59 Gb/s, achieving a low round-trip DSP latency of <;2 \u03bcs and a low mean error-vector magnitude (EVM) of ~2.5% after fiber transmission. In a follow-up experiment, we further demonstrate the transmission of 32 20-MHz LTE signals together with CPRI-compliant CWs, corresponding to a CPRI-equivalent data rate of 39.32 Gb/s, in single optical wavelength channel that requires an RF bandwidth of only ~1.6 GHz.

As a counterpart in machine learning, the modification of connection strength (weight) endows artificial neural networks with a powerful learning capability to solve various problems. Independent of modification for synaptic strength, recent experimental results have revealed that a single neuron also has the ability to change its intrinsic excitability to fit the synaptic input. This mechanism is referred to as neuronal intrinsic plasticity (IP) in the literature. Computational learning rules for IP have been developed based on the hypothesis of information maximization with a stable response level. With the discovery of this novel plasticity mechanism, a series of studies has focused on how IP plays a role in biological neural systems and how they benefit the learning performance of artificial neural networks. In this review, corresponding research on synergies between IP and synaptic plasticity mechanisms is presented in both the computational modeling of biological neural systems and the applications of artificial neural networks, and this combination in artificial learning systems is defined as synergistic learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15819609","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358047/","displayDocTitle":"A Review on Synergistic Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171153 and 61571392"},{"fundingName":"National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Review on Synergistic Learning","sourcePdf":"access-li-2509005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14203S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7358047","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7358050,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilian Nickel","affiliation":["Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning (LCSL), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, MA, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7360840/7358050/nicke-2483592-small.gif","p":["\nMaximilian Nickel received the Ph.D. degree (summa cum laude) from the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany, in 2013.","He is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning, Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, and the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy.

In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's knowledge vault project as an example of such combination.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2483592","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7360840/07358050.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2483592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Relational Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5/7360840/7358050-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Relational Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs","volume":"104","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15669168","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358050/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358050/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM) under NSF STC award","grantNumber":"CCF-1231216"},{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy","grantNumber":"01MT14001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Review of Relational Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs","sourcePdf":"jproc-nickel-2483592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.241056S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7360840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"385","xplore-issue":"7360840","articleId":"7358050","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7358054,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00e9raud Russel Goune Chengui","affiliation":["Laboratory of Modelling and Simulation in Engineering, Biomimetics and Prototypes, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon"],"bio":{"p":["G\u00e9raud Russel Goune Chengui received the M.S. degree in\n physics from the University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon, in 2010.

Contrarily to the overwhelming majority of OEOs, our OEO does not use an external intensity- or phase-modulator to translate the electrical radio-frequency signal into the optical domain. Instead, we show that the electric signal can simply be used as a driving pump current of the laser that is seeding the oscillator. With this architecture, the intensity modulation is performed through the piecewise-linear (that is, nonlinear) power-intensity transfer function of the laser-diode, instead of the sinusoidal transfer function of the usual Mach-Zehnder modulators. We provide a model to investigate the dynamics of this simple architecture of OEO. This model is an integro-differential delay equation which is characterized by three timescales as in the conventional OEO, namely the low/high-cutoff frequencies of the wideband filter and the time delay. The stability analysis of our OEO reveals a complex bifurcation behavior which critically depends on the gain of the feedback loop. In particular, we show that a sequence of Hopf bifurcations may lead to fast-scale oscillations with a period which is the double of the time-delay, or to slow-scale oscillations with a period which depends on the three aforementioned timescales. Our theoretical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations and the experimental measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15786156","htmlLink":"/document/7358054/","displayDocTitle":"The Simplest Laser-Based Optoelectronic Oscillator: An Experimental and Theoretical Study","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"ERC StG 278616"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002830","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"SHYRO"},{"fundingName":"International Center for Theoretical Physics in Italy"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Simplest Laser-Based Optoelectronic Oscillator: An Experimental and Theoretical Study","sourcePdf":"jlt-chembo-2508784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075416S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7404307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7404307","articleId":"7358054","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7358057,"authors":[{"name":"Magnus Karlsson","affiliation":["Photonics Laboratory, Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Magnus Karlsson received the Ph.D. degree from Chalmers University of\n Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1994.

Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser interference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as opposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited regime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and on proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet, these regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design, with the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance. In this paper, we investigate these regimes in terms of collision probability and throughput. We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision probability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under slotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a non-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an interference-limited one, depending on the density of the transmitters, density and size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and transmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of adaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based and contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free phase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the contention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of interference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks. We conclude that, unless proper hybrid schemes are investigated, the severity of the transitional behavior may significantly reduce throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2509073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7406792/07358083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2509073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406792","startPage":"723","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Transitional Behavior of Interference in Millimeter Wave Networks and Its Impact on Medium Access Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Transitional Behavior of Interference in Millimeter Wave Networks and Its Impact on Medium Access Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786046","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7358083/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Transitional Behavior of Interference in Millimeter Wave Networks and Its Impact on Medium Access Control","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shokrighadikolaei-2509073-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103706S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7406792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7406792","articleId":"7358083","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7358085,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxiang Li","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Metallurgical Automation and Detecting Technology of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8052178/7358085/wenli-2500518-small.gif","p":["Wenxiang Li (M\u201914) was born in 1979.

However, the performance of cognitive-radio-based access with these three deployment patterns has not been explored yet. This paper first designs a transmission scheduling method named cognitive access for regular topology (CART) in cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs) with minimal occupation of channels and high transmission efficiency. CART consists of a timeslot-and-channel allocation scheme, a cooperative spectrum-sensing scheme, and a scheme for reporting spectrum-sensing results (SSRs) in SL, TL, and HL. This paper also analyzes CART's cooperative spectrum-sensing performance, reception bandwidth, and transmission delay for different transmission interference range and coverage patterns. Based on numerical analysis and simulation, this paper makes comparison between CART and optimal transmission scheduling method for single channel, and that among these three deployment patterns. Results show the following insights for efficient deployment of CRSN: 1) TL yields the optimal cooperative spectrum-sensing performance among three patterns by data fusion rule of 3-out-of-7; 2) under the same conditions and area for deployment, SL provides the optimal reception bandwidth; 3) SL and TL lead to low transmission delay for critical complete coverage; 4) SL leads to the lowest transmission delay for critical multiple coverage; 5) the false alarm (FA) probability of individual node has little influence on transmission delay, while the probability of primary user's (PU) occurrence has noticeably influence on it; and 6) increasing the ratio of transmission timeslot to spectrum-sensing timeslot may decrease transmission delay","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2500518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8052178","startPage":"1456","endPage":"1466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8052178/07358085.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks for Industrial IoT With Different Deployment Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7358085/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks for Industrial IoT With Different Deployment Patterns","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17205673","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of State Education Ministry"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Research Project of Education Department of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"D20151106 and Q20141110"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks for Industrial IoT With Different Deployment Patterns","sourcePdf":"jsyst-zhu-2500518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078518S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8052178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8052178","articleId":"7358085","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7358087,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson J.

Three strategies are developed to leverage the capability of ConvNets in mining discriminative features for recognition. First, different viewpoints are mimicked by rotating the 3-D points of the captured depth maps. This not only synthesizes more data, but also makes the trained ConvNets view-tolerant. Second, WHDMMs at several temporal scales are constructed to encode the spatiotemporal motion patterns of actions into 2-D spatial structures. The 2-D spatial structures are further enhanced for recognition by converting the WHDMMs into pseudocolor images. Finally, the three ConvNets are initialized with the models obtained from ImageNet and fine-tuned independently on the color-coded WHDMMs constructed in three orthogonal planes. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on the MSRAction3D, MSRAction3DExt, UTKinect-Action, and MSRDailyActivity3D datasets using cross-subject protocols. In addition, the method was evaluated on the large dataset constructed from the above datasets. The proposed method achieved 2-9% better results on most of the individual datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method maintained its performance on the large dataset, whereas the performance of existing methods decreased with the increased number of actions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16139135","htmlLink":"/document/7358110/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Action Recognition From Depth Maps Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action Recognition From Depth Maps Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"thms-wang-2504550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097506S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7511814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"7511814","articleId":"7358110","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358113,"authors":[{"name":"Cai Dai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7358113/dai-2503433-small.gif","p":["Cai Dai received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014.","His current research interests include multi-objective optimization and evolutionary algorithms."]},"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085624731"},{"name":"Yuping Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7358113/wang-2503433-small.gif","p":["Yuping Wang (SM\u201911) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Mathematics, Xian Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1993.","He is a Full Professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an.

In order to improve the search efficiency of an evolutionary algorithm and maintain the diversity of solutions, in this paper, the learning automata (LA) is first used for quantization orthogonal crossover (QOX), and a new fitness function based on decomposition is proposed to achieve these two purposes. Based on these, an orthogonal evolutionary algorithm with LA for complex multiobjective optimization problems with continuous variables is proposed. The experimental results show that in continuous states, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve accurate Pareto-optimal sets and wide Pareto-optimal fronts efficiently. Moreover, the comparison with the several existing well-known algorithms: nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with an ensemble of neighborhood sizes, multiobjective optimization by LA, and multiobjective immune algorithm with nondominated neighbor-based selection, on 15 multiobjective benchmark problems, shows that the proposed algorithm is able to find more accurate and evenly distributed Pareto-optimal fronts than the compared ones.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2503433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7744634/07358113.pdf","startPage":"3306","endPage":"3319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2503433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7744634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Orthogonal Evolutionary Algorithm With Learning Automata for Multiobjective Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Orthogonal Evolutionary Algorithm With Learning Automata for Multiobjective Optimization","volume":"46","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16465639","pubMedId":"26685277","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358113/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358113/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472297 and 61272119"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"BDZ021430"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Orthogonal Evolutionary Algorithm With Learning Automata for Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wang-2503433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137427S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7358113","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7358115,"authors":[{"name":"Trong Huynh-Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7387799/7358115/huynh-2504729-small.gif","p":["Trong Huynh-Bao (S\u201913) received the M.Sc.

Our results show that the VFET bitcells are denser than the LFET bitcells by 20%-30%. The SRAM read stability (read static noise margin) is significantly improved using the NW channel.

Applying the proposed VT retargeting technique can allow the VFET 122 bitcell to operate at 0.57 V without using assist circuits. A standby leakage below 10 pA/cell can be achieved for both architectures. At isoperformance, the standby leakage of VFET bitcells is 2.6\u00d7 lower than LFET bitcells.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2504729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2504729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7387799/07358115.pdf","startPage":"643","endPage":"651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7387799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Benchmark and Optimization of 5-nm Lateral and Vertical GAA 6T-SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Benchmark and Optimization of 5-nm Lateral and Vertical GAA 6T-SRAMs","volume":"63","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2016","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720222","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358115/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"imec\u2019s (sub-)10 nm CMOS Industrial Affiliation Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Benchmark and Optimization of 5-nm Lateral and Vertical GAA 6T-SRAMs","sourcePdf":"ted-huynhbao-2504729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111964S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7387799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7387799","articleId":"7358115","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7358123,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hung Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7387799/7358123/cyu-2505064-small.gif","p":["Chang-Hung Yu (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2007, and the M.S. degree from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Electronics.","His current research interests include design and modeling of emerging CMOS devices, analysis and design of low-power SRAMs in ultrascaled technologies, and device-circuit interaction."]},"firstName":"Chang-Hung","lastName":"Yu","id":"37962768800"},{"name":"Ming-Long Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7387799/7358123/fan-2505064-small.gif","p":["Ming-Long Fan received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering, Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2014.","He is currently with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., Hsinchu."]},"firstName":"Ming-Long","lastName":"Fan","id":"37392424800"},{"name":"Kuan-Chin Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7387799/7358123/kyu-2505064-small.gif","p":["Kuan-Chin Yu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.","She is currently with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., Hsinchu."]},"firstName":"Kuan-Chin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085413322"},{"name":"Vita Pi-Ho Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7387799/7358123/hu-2505064-small.gif","p":["Vita Pi-Ho Hu (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the B.S. degree in materials science and engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering and the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2004 and 2011, respectively.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan."]},"firstName":"Vita Pi-Ho","lastName":"Hu","id":"37391915700"},{"name":"Pin Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7387799/7358123/su-2505064-small.gif","p":["Pin Su (S\u201998\u2013M\u201902) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

It was noted early in the development of these devices that elastic energy storage can lead to a rapid snapping motion for designs with moderate to high tube curvatures. Substantial progress has recently been made in the concentric tube robot community in designing snap-free robots, planning stable paths, and characterizing conditions that result in snapping for specific classes of concentric tube robots. However, a general measure for determining the stability of a given robot configuration has yet to be proposed. In this paper, we use bifurcation and elastic stability theory to provide such a measure, as well as to produce a test for determining whether a given design is snap-free (i.e., whether snapping can occur anywhere in the unloaded robot's workspace). These results are useful in designing, planning motions for, and controlling concentric tube robots with high curvatures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358134/","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7358134/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15773551","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"27042170","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Elastic Stability of Concentric Tube Robots: A Stability Measure and Design Test","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)"},{"fundingName":"CAREER","grantNumber":"IIS-1054331"},{"fundingName":"Graduate Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"DGE-0909667"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)","grantNumber":"R01 EB017467"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic Stability of Concentric Tube Robots: A Stability Measure and Design Test","sourcePdf":"tro-gilbert-2500422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115558S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7399431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7399431","articleId":"7358134","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":7358135,"authors":[{"name":"Ashis Maity","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7475920/7358135/maity-2509070-small.gif","p":["Ashis Maity (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree from Bengal\n Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India, in 2002, and the M.S. degree from the Indian Institute of\n Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2009, respectively.

The combined effects of enhanced slew rate and expanded loop bandwidth using the DSE-AB scheme produce a very low undershoot and overshoot. When this scheme is directly applied to an internally compensated, capacitor-less low dropout regulator (CL-LDR) topology, besides the slew enhancement, the instantaneous dynamic current may reduce the damping factor momentarily and produce more ringing in the load transient response. This paper first analyzes the generation of momentary low damping factor in the CL-LDR that uses the DSE-AB scheme. A current limited DSE-AB scheme is also proposed to increase the momentary damping factor for minimizing the ringing in the settling behavior. To validate the proposed scheme, the CL-LDR is implemented in a 0.18$\\ \\mu$m CMOS technology and the regulator's performance is evaluated in different dynamic conditions. Experimental result shows an undershoot of 45 mV during 0-100-mA load step and an overshoot of 25 mV during the other edge.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2509070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7475920/07358135.pdf","startPage":"7016","endPage":"7028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2509070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7475920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Performance Evaluation of a Dynamically Slew Enhanced Adaptively Biased Capacitor-Less Low Dropout Regulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358135/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Performance Evaluation of a Dynamically Slew Enhanced Adaptively Biased Capacitor-Less Low Dropout Regulator","volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16003798","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358135/","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Design, and Performance Evaluation of a Dynamically Slew Enhanced Adaptively Biased Capacitor-Less Low Dropout Regulator","sourcePdf":"tpel-maity-2509070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101508S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7475920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7475920","articleId":"7358135","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358139,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Jung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7797565/7358139/tliu-2500268-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Jung Liu (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1998, the M.S. degree in communication engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2014.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, from October 2014 to January 2015.

We first extract features from existing image quality metrics and train them to form basic image quality scorers (BIQSs). Then, we select additional features to address specific distortion types and train them to construct auxiliary image quality scorers (AIQSs). Both BIQSs and AIQSs are trained on small image subsets of certain distortion types and, as a result, they are weak performers with respect to a wide variety of distortions. Finally, we adopt the ParaBoost framework, which is a statistical scorer selection scheme for support vector regression (SVR), to fuse the scores of BIQSs and AIQSs to evaluate the images containing a wide range of distortion types. This ParaBoost methodology can be easily extended to images of new distortion types. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the ParaBoost method, which outperforms existing IQA methods by a significant margin. Specifically, the Spearman rank order correlation coefficients (SROCCs) of the ParaBoost method with respect to the LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008, and TID2013 image quality databases are 0.98, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2500268","startPage":"107","endPage":"121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2500268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7797565","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7797565/07358139.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ParaBoost Method to Image Quality Assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358139/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A ParaBoost Method to Image Quality Assessment","volume":"28","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7358139/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16560987","pubMedId":"26685266","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ParaBoost Method to Image Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liu-2500268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110164S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7797565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7797565","articleId":"7358139","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7358145,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-feng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274988800"},{"name":"Petros Elia","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Elia","id":"37295919600"},{"name":"Arun Kumar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Arun Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37534701800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"7358145","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The rate-reliability-complexity limits of a quasi-static \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex></formula>\n-user multiple access channel (MAC), with or without feedback, are explored in this paper. Using high-SNR asymptotics, bounds on the computational resources required to achieve near-optimal (ML-based) decoding performance are first derived. They, in turn, yield bounds on the (reduced) complexity needed to achieve any (including suboptimal) diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) performance. Similar complexity-bounds in the presence of feedback-aided user selection are also given. This latter effort reveals the ability of a few bits of feedback not only to improve performance, but also to reduce complexity. In this context, our analysis reveals the interesting finding that a proper calibration of user selection can allow for near-optimal ML-based decoding, with complexity that need not scale exponentially in the total number of codeword bits. The derived bounds constitute the best known performance-versus-complexity behavior to date for ML-based MAC decoding, as well as a first exploration of the complexity-feedback-performance interdependencies in multiuser settings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Reliability","Receiving antennas","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","channel coding","communication complexity","decoding","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance-complexity analysis","MAC","rate-reliability-complexity limit","quasistatic-user multiple access channel","high-SNR asymptotics","computational resource reduction","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","DMT","feedback-aided user selection","calibration","near-optimal ML-based decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complexity exponent","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","multiple access channel","performance-complexity tradeoff","user selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2508788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7410177/07358145.pdf","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2508788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance-Complexity Analysis for MAC ML-Based Decoding With User Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance-Complexity Analysis for MAC ML-Based Decoding With User Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358145/","volume":"64","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15799032","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance-Complexity Analysis for MAC ML-Based Decoding With User Selection","sourcePdf":"tsp-lu-2508788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043811S","chronDate":"April1,  2016","isNumber":"7410177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","articleId":"7358145","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":7358146,"authors":[{"name":"Pin Lim","affiliation":["Rolls-Royce Advance Technology Center, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7797565/7358146/lim-2504389-small.gif","p":["Pin Lim received the B.Eng.

An increasingly popular approach toward tackling prognostic problems involves the use of switching models to represent various degradation phases, which the system undergoes. Such approaches have the advantage of determining the exact degradation phase of the system and being able to handle nonlinear degradation models through piecewise linear approximation. However, limitations of such existing methods include, limited applicability due to the discretization of predicted remaining useful life, insufficient robustness due to the use of single models and others. This paper circumvents these limitations by proposing a hybrid of ensemble methods with switching methods. The proposed method first implements a switching Kalman filter (SKF) to classify between various linear degradation phases, then predict the future propagation of fault dimension using appropriate Kalman filters for each phase. This proposed method achieves both continuous and discrete prediction values representing the remaining life and degradation phase of the system, respectively. The proposed framework is shown via a case study on benchmark simulated aeroengine data sets. The evaluation of the proposed framework shows that the proposed method achieves better accuracy and robustness against noise compared with other methods reported in the literature. The results also indicate the effectiveness of the SKF in detecting the switching point between various degradation modes.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2504389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7797565/07358146.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2504389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7797565","startPage":"136","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Degradation Prognostics Based on Switching Kalman Filter Ensemble","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Degradation Prognostics Based on Switching Kalman Filter Ensemble","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16560995","pubMedId":"26685271","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7358146/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Economic Development Board Industrial Postgraduate Programme Fund","grantNumber":"R-263-000-A14-592"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Degradation Prognostics Based on Switching Kalman Filter Ensemble","sourcePdf":"tnnls-lim-2504389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107142S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7797565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7797565","articleId":"7358146","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358147,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhua Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuhua","lastName":"Xu","id":"37596320600"},{"name":"Chenggui Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chenggui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085696745"},{"name":"Junhong Chen","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Junhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085384241"},{"name":"Jinlong Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280540300"},{"name":"Yitao Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yitao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37066215900"},{"name":"Qihui Wu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qihui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085463087"},{"name":"Alagan Anpalagan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Alagan","lastName":"Anpalagan","id":"37270506600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7358147","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Games","Dynamic spectrum access","Aggregates","Nash equilibrium","Optimization","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","game theory","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load-aware dynamic spectrum access","small-cell networks","graphical game approach","dynamic spectrum access problem","cell loads","local interference relationship","formulated spectrum access game","exact potential game","aggregate interference level","Nash equilibrium","optimization problem","autonomous best response learning","BR learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic spectrum access","fifth-generation (5G) networks","potential game","small-cell networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the problem of dynamic spectrum access for small-cell networks using a graphical game approach. Compared with existing studies, we take the features of different cell loads and local interference relationship into account. It is proven that the formulated spectrum access game is an exact potential game (EPG) with the aggregate interference level as the potential function, and the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game corresponds to the global or local optima of the original optimization problem. A lower bound of the achievable aggregate interference level is rigorously derived. Finally, we propose an autonomous best response (BR) learning algorithm to converge toward its NE. It is shown that the proposed game-theoretic solution converges rapidly, and its achievable performance is close to the optimum solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Aware Dynamic Spectrum Access for Small-Cell Networks: A Graphical Game Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2508998","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07358147.pdf","startPage":"8794","endPage":"8800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2508998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Load-Aware Dynamic Spectrum Access for Small-Cell Networks: A Graphical Game Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7358147/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378645","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401508 and 61172062"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Aware Dynamic Spectrum Access for Small-Cell Networks: A Graphical Game Approach","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2508998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107159S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7358147","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358154,"authors":[{"name":"Jamshid Aghaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7437506/7358154/aghae-2500539-small.gif","p":["Jamshid Aghaei (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Power and Water Institute of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, 2005, and 2009, respectively.

Owing to the ability of demand side to cover wind power imbalances, aggregated loads have been presented in the literature as a good complementary resource for the wind generation. To this end, this paper proposes a technique to obtain the best offering strategy for a hybrid power plant consisting of a wind power producer and a demand response provider in the power market. In addition, conditional value-at-risk is used to limit the risk on profit variability. Finally, a detailed analysis of a realistic case study based on a wind farm in Spain has illustrated that joint operation of wind power producers and demand response providers can increase the expected profit and reduce the potential risks.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2500539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7437506/07358154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2500539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7437506","startPage":"513","endPage":"525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk-Constrained Offering Strategy for Aggregated Hybrid Power Plant Including Wind Power Producer and Demand Response Provider","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Risk-Constrained Offering Strategy for Aggregated Hybrid Power Plant Including Wind Power Producer and Demand Response Provider","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15871517","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7358154/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FEDER"},{"fundingName":"COMPETE"},{"fundingName":"FCT","grantNumber":"FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-020282, PTDC/EEA-EEL/118519/2010 and UID/CEC/50021/2013"},{"fundingName":"EU 7th Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2007-2013 and 309048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk-Constrained Offering Strategy for Aggregated Hybrid Power Plant Including Wind Power Producer and Demand Response Provider","sourcePdf":"tste-catalao-2500539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113901S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7437506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7437506","articleId":"7358154","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358155,"authors":[{"name":"Qingqing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7448989/7358155/qinwu-2509067-small.gif","p":["Qingqing Wu (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012.

Moreover, the circuit power consumption is often assumed to be constant regardless of the transmission rate or the bandwidth. In this paper, we investigate the system-level energy-efficient transmission in multi-radio access networks by considering joint Tx and Rx power consumption and adopting link-dependent dynamic circuit power model. A combinatorial-type optimization problem for user scheduling, radio-link activation, and power control is formulated with the objective of maximizing joint Tx and Rx energy efficiency (EE). We tackle this problem using a divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, the concepts of link EE and user EE are first introduced, which have structures similar to the system EE. Then, we explore their hierarchical relationships and propose an optimal algorithm whose complexity is linear in the product of the total number of users and radio links. Furthermore, we investigate the EE maximization problem with minimum user data rate constraints. The divide-and-conquer approach is also applied to find a sub-optimal but efficient solution. Finally, comprehensive numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2509067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7448989/07358155.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2509067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7448989","startPage":"2727","endPage":"2740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Tx/Rx Energy-Efficient Scheduling in Multi-Radio Wireless Networks: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Tx/Rx Energy-Efficient Scheduling in Multi-Radio Wireless Networks: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15904703","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7358155/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National","grantNumber":"973 #2012CB316106"},{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"#61322102, #61329101 and #61328101"},{"fundingName":"National","grantNumber":"863 #2015AA01A710"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Tx/Rx Energy-Efficient Scheduling in Multi-Radio Wireless Networks: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach","sourcePdf":"twc-tao-2509067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110737S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7448989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7448989","articleId":"7358155","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358163,"authors":[{"name":"Jingzhou Pang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jingzhou","lastName":"Pang","id":"37085609948"},{"name":"Songbai He","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Songbai","lastName":"He","id":"37279982200"},{"name":"Zhijiang Dai","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhijiang","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085538343"},{"name":"Chaoyi Huang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chaoyi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085621667"},{"name":"Jun Peng","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085528334"},{"name":"Fei You","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"You","id":"37268438300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7358163","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2237},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband communication","Impedance","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Power generation","Transmission line measurements","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","integrated circuit design","power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEMT","output power back-off","low-order impedance transformation networks","post-matching structure","broadband asymmetric Doherty power amplifier","broadband applications","post-matching asymmetric Doherty power amplifier","bandwidth 800 MHz","efficiency 50.4 percent to 56.2 percent","frequency 1.55 GHz to 2.35 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric Doherty power amplifier (APDA)","broadband","low-order impedance inverter","post matching"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the design of a broadband asymmetric Doherty power amplifier (ADPA) with an 800 MHz (41% fractional) bandwidth is presented.

Power allocation strategies are of crucial importance for green cognitive radio networks. However, energy-efficient power allocation strategies in green cognitive radio networks have not been fully studied. Energy efficiency maximization problems are analyzed in delay-insensitive cognitive radio, delay-sensitive cognitive radio, and simultaneously delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive cognitive radio, where a secondary user coexists with a primary user and the channels are fading. Using fractional programming and convex optimization techniques, energy-efficient optimal power allocation strategies are proposed subject to constraints on the average interference power, along with the peak/average transmit power. It is shown that the secondary user can achieve energy efficiency gains under the average transmit power constraint, in contrast to the peak transmit power constraint. Simulation results show that the fading of the channel between the primary user transmitter and the secondary user receiver and the fading of the channel between the secondary user transmitter and the primary user receiver are favorable to the secondary user with respect to the energy efficiency maximization of the secondary user, whereas the fading of the channel between the secondary user transmitter and the secondary user receiver is unfavorable to the secondary user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"15","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15904721","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7358164/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Optimal Power Allocation for Fading Cognitive Radio Channels: Ergodic Capacity, Outage Capacity, and Minimum-Rate Capacity","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"7215433803, 7214433802 and 7214514902"},{"fundingName":"863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA8098080E"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301179, 61401323, 61401338 and 61471395"},{"fundingName":"scholarship from China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Optimal Power Allocation for Fading Cognitive Radio Channels: Ergodic Capacity, Outage Capacity, and Minimum-Rate Capacity","sourcePdf":"twc-zhou-2509069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137405S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7448989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7448989","articleId":"7358164","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7358165,"authors":[{"name":"Jau-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7370835/7358165/7358165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jau-Horng Chen (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Design Engineer with Freescale Semiconductor, Tempe, AZ, USA, where he was involved in designing dc\u2013dc converters and predistortion linearizers for cell phone power amplifiers (PAs).

Previous implementations of the PMPT successfully achieved bandwidths up to 5 MHz. However, as the bandwidth of the signal increases, nonidealities of the PMPT limit the performance of this architecture. The nonidealities are predominantly aliasing from pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and distortions from switching, which degrade the spectral performance. By using aliasing-free digital PWM and digital pre-distortion concurrently, spectral performance of the PMPT can be improved for wide bandwidth applications. For validation, a prototype transmitter was tested with a 20-MHz bandwidth downlink long-term evolution (LTE) signal at 836.5 MHz. Using the proposed method, the prototype transmitter achieved an output power of 19.8 dBm and drain efficiency of 24.4% while passing the spectral requirements of the LTE standard for femtocell base stations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearity Enhanced Wide-Bandwidth Pulse-Modulated Polar Transmitters for LTE Femtocell Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7370835/07358165.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7370835","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Linearity Enhanced Wide-Bandwidth Pulse-Modulated Polar Transmitters for LTE Femtocell Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7358165/","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685021","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearity Enhanced Wide-Bandwidth Pulse-Modulated Polar Transmitters for LTE Femtocell Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chen-2504498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094449S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7370835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7370835","articleId":"7358165","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358167,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Lung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan (R.O.C.)"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7370835/7358167/7358167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Lung Yang (S\u201902\u2013M\u201907) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1997, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Communication Institute at National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2007.","Following one year of postdoctoral work with the IDEAS Laboratory, Purdue University, he joined the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

The proposed technique overcomes the problem engendered by the existence of air gaps between the sensor ground plane and the MUT. In the proposed approach, a derived governing equation of the resonance frequencies is used to estimate the thickness and complex permittivity of the MUT by calculating the resonant frequency (f r) and magnitude response in a single-step noncontact measurement process. This study theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified a simple and low-cost SC-TCSRR measurement method for assessing materials in a noncontact method. For a 0.2-mm air gap, the experiments yielded average measurement errors of 4.32% and 5.05% for the thickness and permittivity, respectively. The proposed SC-TCSRR technique provides excellent solutions for reducing the effect of air-gap conditions on permittivity, thickness, and loss tangent in noncontact measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7370835/07358167.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2503764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2503764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7370835","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncontact Measurement of Complex Permittivity and Thickness by Using Planar Resonators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permittivity","Permittivity measurement","Air gaps","Resonant frequency","Frequency measurement","Thickness measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","measurement errors","nondestructive testing","permittivity measurement","resonators","sensors","thickness measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex permittivity","planar resonators","noncontact measurement technique","single-compound triple complementary split-ring resonator","SC-TCSRR measurement method","material under test","MUT","air gaps","sensor ground plane","resonance frequencies","magnitude response","single-step noncontact measurement process","measurement errors","SC-TCSRR technique","loss tangent","size 0.2 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs)","noncontact measurement","permittivity and thickness measurement","triple rings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Noncontact Measurement of Complex Permittivity and Thickness by Using Planar Resonators","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7358167/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685008","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncontact Measurement of Complex Permittivity and Thickness by Using Planar Resonators","sourcePdf":"tmtt-yang-2503764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074538S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7370835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"7370835","articleId":"7358167","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7358168,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada","School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7370835/7358168/7358168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Feng (S\u201913) was born February 7, 1990, in Huludao, Liaoning, China.

In this technique, neural networks are trained to learn the relationship between pole/residues of the transfer functions and geometrical parameters. The order of the pole-residue transfer function may vary over different regions of geometrical parameters. We develop a pole-residue tracking technique to solve this order-changing problem. After the proposed modeling process, the trained model can be used to provide accurate and fast prediction of the EM behavior of microwave components with geometrical parameters as variables. The proposed method can obtain better accuracy in challenging applications involving high dimension of geometrical parameter space and large geometrical variations, compared with conventional modeling methods. The proposed technique is effective and robust especially in solving high-order problems. This technique is illustrated by three examples of EM parametric modeling.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504099","startPage":"60","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7370835","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7370835/07358168.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Modeling of EM Behavior of Microwave Components Using Combined Neural Networks and Pole-Residue-Based Transfer Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358168/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parametric Modeling of EM Behavior of Microwave Components Using Combined Neural Networks and Pole-Residue-Based Transfer Functions","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7358168/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15684999","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Parametric Modeling of EM Behavior of Microwave Components Using Combined Neural Networks and Pole-Residue-Based Transfer Functions","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2504099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096418S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7370835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"7370835","articleId":"7358168","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":7358171,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7370835/7358171/7358171-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Yu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sichuan University, Sichuan, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2010, and another M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the International Technological University, San Jose, CA, USA, in 2012.

In the context of HFR streaming video, end-to-end distortion and sending frame rate are equally important to the perceptual quality. This study presents a modeling-based approach to optimizing the HFR video transmission over wireless networks. First, we develop an analytical model dubbed FRIED (Frame Rate versus vIdEo Distortion) to characterize the tradeoff between sending frame rate and end-to-end video distortion. Second, we propose a Joint frAme Selection and FEC (Forward Error Correction) cOding (JASCO) approach based on the FRIED model to optimize the transmission performance. The efficacy of the proposed JASCO is evaluated through extensive semi-physical emulations in Exata involving H.264 video streaming. Experimental results show that JASCO outperforms the reference approaches in improving video peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) at the same frame rate. Or conversely, JASCO is able to achieve higher received frame rate while guaranteeing the same video PSNR.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2509063","startPage":"2713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7448989/07358172.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2509063","endPage":"2726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7448989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Optimization of High Frame Rate Video Transmission Over Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Optimization of High Frame Rate Video Transmission Over Wireless Networks","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7358172/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15917586","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"1405594"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61550110244"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Optimization of High Frame Rate Video Transmission Over Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-wu-2509063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130557S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7448989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7448989","articleId":"7358172","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7358174,"authors":[{"name":"He Zhu","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085379802"},{"name":"Amin M.

low insertion loss and compact size 4-bit phase shifter in 65 nm CMOS Technology. In order to get low insertion loss and compact size, this phase shifter is composed of two types of passive phase shifters, high-pass/low-pass type and switched filter type. Various techniques are used such as triple well body-floating, gate-floating, removal of capacitance of the off-state transistor using resonant inductor, and minimized interconnection line which is based on matching network. This phase shifter has 6.36 dB of average insertion loss over the 27.5-28.35 GHz, and loss variation is about 2 dB.

The literature has plenty of solutions aimed at keeping EMI filters' attenuation as high as possible in the widest possible frequency range. However such filters are less effective than expected because of the parasitic elements introduced by interconnects. As a consequence, EMI can be propagated into ICs causing temporary or definitive operation failures. This paper points out the causes of EMI-induced errors in high-side current sensors based on low-offset chopper OTAs. Analyses presented in the paper are supported by direct power injection measurements carried out on a test chip.","doi":"10.1109/EMCCompo.2015.7358341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMCCompo.2015.7358341","startPage":"115","endPage":"118","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Workshop on the Electromagnetic Compatibility of Integrated Circuits (EMC Compo)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352268/7358224/07358341.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Workshop on the Electromagnetic Compatibility of Integrated Circuits (EMC Compo)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Susceptibility to EMI of high side current sensors based on chopper OpAmps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Susceptibility to EMI of high side current sensors based on chopper OpAmps","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358341/","accessionNumber":"15668691","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358341/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Susceptibility to EMI of high side current sensors based on chopper OpAmps","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"0016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037047S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7352268","isNumber":"7358224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7352268","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7358224","articleId":"7358341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7358368,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Magerl","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Magerl","id":"37085742525"},{"name":"Christian Stockreiter","affiliation":["Ams AG, Unterpremstaetten, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Stockreiter","id":"37297266600"},{"name":"Oliver Eisenberger","affiliation":["Ams AG, Unterpremstaetten, Austria"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Eisenberger","id":"37297627100"},{"name":"Rainer Minixhofer","affiliation":["Ams AG, Unterpremstaetten, Austria"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Minixhofer","id":"37267474000"},{"name":"Adrijan Baric","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Adrijan","lastName":"Baric","id":"37355587000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7897-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7896-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7358368","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358368","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Analytical models","Photonic band gap","Electromagnetic compatibility","Transient analysis","MATLAB","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","electromagnetic compatibility","integrated circuit modelling","neural nets","reference circuits","time-domain analysis","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex integrated circuits","black-box modelling approach","time-to-steady-state","transistor-level models","transient analysis","transistor-level block","interconnected circuit blocks","bandgap reference circuit sub-block","Verilog A module","artificial neural network","direct power injection immunity test","time-domain simulations","EMC simulations","building interchangeable black-box models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["black-box modelling","integrated circuits","direct power injection","artificial neural networks","bandgap reference","simulation speed-up"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMCCompo.2015.7358368","endPage":"263","startPage":"258","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Workshop on the Electromagnetic Compatibility of Integrated Circuits (EMC Compo)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Workshop on the Electromagnetic Compatibility of Integrated Circuits (EMC Compo)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7352268/7358224/07358368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMCCompo.2015.7358368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building interchangeable black-box models of integrated circuits for EMC simulations","abstract":"An interchangeable black-box model of an integrated circuit block for time-domain simulations of the direct power injection (DPI) immunity test is presented. An artificial neural network implemented as a Verilog A module is used to build a model of a bandgap reference circuit sub-block.

The simulation time for the transient analysis is significantly improved compared to the transistor-level models, and the time-to-steady-state of the model is negligible.

By using orthogonal sequentially-rotated linearly-polarized antennas and the hybrid-transformer-based duplexer, the transmitter and receiver duplexes the two antennas with orthogonal circular-polarized signals. An on-chip tuning technique using magnetic coupling is introduced to improve the isolation of the duplexer in case of impedance imbalances. An alternative duplexer with a similar principle using an on-board rat-race coupler is also proposed and designed for comparison. In order to demonstrate the isolation with practical antenna connections, prototypes have been developed to integrate the on-chip duplexer and the rat-race coupler with on-board aperture-coupled microstrip antennas with sequential rotation technique. Measurement results demonstrate the orthogonal circular polarizations for the receiver and transmitter modes on both prototypes. The achieved isolation by the on-chip tunable duplexer is better than 50 dB between 30.2 and 31.2 GHz, while the achieved isolation by the rat-race version is about 20 dB in the same bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7370835/07358460.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2504476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7370835","startPage":"166","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Millimeter-Wave Tunable Hybrid-Transformer-Based Circular Polarization Duplexer With Sequentially-Rotated Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Millimeter-Wave Tunable Hybrid-Transformer-Based Circular Polarization Duplexer With Sequentially-Rotated Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15684998","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7358460/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Millimeter-Wave Tunable Hybrid-Transformer-Based Circular Polarization Duplexer With Sequentially-Rotated Antennas","sourcePdf":"tmtt-lu-2504476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13188S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7370835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7370835","articleId":"7358460","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7358544,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Next, we investigate local stability of those multiple equilibrium points, which shows that 3n equilibrium points are locally stable. The new multistability results are obtained by virtue of the fixed point theorem and the theory of strict diagonal dominance matrix. The theoretical results are finally validated by a numerical example along with computer simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358690/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15666557","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358690/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"17-18 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On multistability of competitive neural networks with discontinuous activation functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multistability of competitive neural networks with discontinuous activation functions","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"0049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128103S","chronDate":"17-18 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7347056","isNumber":"7358639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347056","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7358639","articleId":"7358690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Engineers Australia","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7358707,"authors":[{"name":"Shogo Takada","affiliation":["With Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shogo","lastName":"Takada","id":"37085732868"},{"name":"Osamu Kaneko","affiliation":["With Institute of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37276991200"},{"name":"Taiki Nakamura","affiliation":["With Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Taiki","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37085607559"},{"name":"Shigeru Yamamoto","affiliation":["With Institute of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37276830100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-9221-0739-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7358707","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Hysteresis","Tuning","Cost function","Computational modeling","Muscles","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","nonlinear control systems","pneumatic actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven controller tuning","nonlinear internal model controller","pneumatic artificial muscles","PAM","flexible structure","fictitious reference iterative tuning","FRIT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358707","abstract":"This paper proposes a data-driven approach to control of the pneumatic artificial muscle (which is abbreviated as PAM). Although the PAM has a desirable advantage of flexible structures, the inherent nonlinear property makes it difficult to obtain a mathematical model and to design an appropriate controller. As one of the ways to overcome such difficulties, a data-driven controller tuning based on the direct use of the data is expected to be utilized. Particularly, we apply fictitious reference iterative tuning (which is abbreviated as FRIT), which is a data-driven controller tuning method that enables us to obtain a desirable controller parameter with only one-shot experimental data, for tuning of parameters of controllers to obtain desired response of the PAM. In addition, we show that it is possible to obtain not only the desired controller but also the mathematical model of the PAM by using the internal model controller (which is abbreviated as IMC) including a nonlinear mathematical model of the PAM. Finally, we give an experimental result in order to show the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/AUCC.2014.7358707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUCC.2014.7358707","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th Australian Control Conference (AUCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7347056/7358639/07358707.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 4th Australian Control Conference (AUCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven tuning of nonlinear internal model controllers for pneumatic artificial muscles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven tuning of nonlinear internal model controllers for pneumatic artificial muscles","conferenceDate":"17-18 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358707/","accessionNumber":"15666569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358707/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven tuning of nonlinear internal model controllers for pneumatic artificial muscles","confLoc":"Canberra, ACT, Australia","sourcePdf":"0076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061744S","chronDate":"17-18 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7347056","isNumber":"7358639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7347056","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7358639","articleId":"7358707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Engineers Australia","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7358754,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Rafiqul Alam","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering"],"firstName":"Mohammad Rafiqul","lastName":"Alam","id":"38580497200"},{"name":"Mohammed Bennamoun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Bennamoun","id":"37284017200"},{"name":"Roberto Togneri","affiliation":["School of Electrical, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Togneri","id":"37274683100"},{"name":"Ferdous Sohel","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering"],"firstName":"Ferdous","lastName":"Sohel","id":"37300482800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8776-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8775-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7358754","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Training","Support vector machines","Speech","Neural networks","Gold","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","image recognition","neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-visual person recognition","deep neural networks","audio-visual biometrics","DBN-DNN","deep belief networks","deterministic feed forward DNN","generative weights","deep Boltzmann machines","DBM","softmax layer","error rates","support vector machine","SVM","linear regression-based classifier","LRC","audio-visual datasets","VidTIMIT","MOBIO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358754","abstract":"This paper presents applications of special types of deep neural networks (DNNs) for audio-visual biometrics.

However, the use of finger vein recognition also indicated its vulnerability to presentation attacks (or direct attacks). In this work, we present a novel algorithm to identify the liveness of the finger vein characteristic that is presented to the sensor. The core idea of the proposed approach is to magnify the blood flow through the finger vein to measure its liveness. To this extent, we employ the Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) approach to enhance the motion of the blood in the recorded finger vein video. Next, we further process the magnified video to extract the motion-based features using optical flow to identify the finger vein artefacts. Extensive experiments are carried out on a relatively large database that is comprised of normal presentations vein videos from 300 unique finger instances corresponding to 100 subjects. The finger vein artefact database is captured by printing 300 real (or normal) presentation image of the finger vein sample on a high-quality paper using two different kinds of printers namely laser and inkjet. Extensive comparative evaluation with four different well-established state-of-the-art schemes demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2015.7358762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2015.7358762","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7348870/7358743/07358762.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finger vein liveness detection using motion magnification","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Finger vein liveness detection using motion magnification","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358762/","accessionNumber":"15668074","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358762/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finger vein liveness detection using motion magnification","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"FingerveinLiveness.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075965S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7348870","isNumber":"7358743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7348870","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7358743","articleId":"7358762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7358776,"authors":[{"name":"Valerio Mura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari (Italy)"],"firstName":"Valerio","lastName":"Mura","id":"37076018300"},{"name":"Luca Ghiani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari (Italy)"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Ghiani","id":"38467799700"},{"name":"Gian Luca Marcialis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari (Italy)"],"firstName":"Gian Luca","lastName":"Marcialis","id":"37601556400"},{"name":"Fabio Roli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari (Italy)"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Roli","id":"37269799800"},{"name":"David A.

Replay, voice conversion and speech synthesis attacks drastically degrade the performance of a standard ASV system by increasing its false acceptance rates. This issue raised a high level of interest in the speech research community where the possible voice spoofing attacks and their related countermeasures have been investigated. However, much less effort has been devoted in creating realistic and diverse spoofing attack databases that foster researchers to correctly evaluate their countermeasures against attacks. The existing studies are not complete in terms of types of attacks, and often difficult to reproduce because of unavailability of public databases. In this paper we introduce the voice spoofing data-set of AVspoof, a public audio-visual spoofing database. AVspoof includes ten realistic spoofing threats generated using replay, speech synthesis and voice conversion.

We propose a novel framework for multi-view face recognition based on extracting and matching pose-robust face signatures from 2D images. Specifically, we propose an efficient method for monocular 3D face reconstruction, which is used to lift the 2D facial appearance to a canonical texture space and estimate the self-occlusion. On the lifted facial texture we then extract various local features, which are further enhanced by the occlusion encodings computed on the self-occlusion mask, resulting in a pose-robust face signature, a novel feature representation of the original 2D facial image. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method not only simplifies the matching of multi-view 2D facial images by circumventing the requirement for pose-adaptive classifiers, but also achieves superior performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pose-robust face signature for multi-view face recognition","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2015.7358788","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7348870/7358743/07358788.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2015.7358788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7358788","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7358788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pose-robust face signature for multi-view face recognition","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7358788/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pose-robust face signature for multi-view face recognition","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"PoseRobustFace.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128391S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7348870","isNumber":"7358743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7348870","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7358743","articleId":"7358788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7358802,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Center for Automation Research University of Maryland, College Park, MD"],"firstName":"Jun-Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085407949"},{"name":"Swami Sankaranarayanan","affiliation":["Center for Automation Research University of Maryland, College Park, MD"],"firstName":"Swami","lastName":"Sankaranarayanan","id":"37085717370"},{"name":"Vishal M.

To facilitate the innovation of the fifth generation (5G) networks, the cloud radio access network (RAN) and fog network have been proposed to respond newly emerging traffic demands. The cloud RAN functions more toward centralized resource management to achieve optimal transmissions. The fog network takes advantage of social information and edge computing to efficiently alleviate the end-to-end latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of these two network structures, and then investigate possible harmonization to integrate both for the diverse needs of 5G mobile communications. We analytically study the harmonization of cloud RAN and fog network from various points of view, including the cache of Internet contents, mobility management, and radio access control. The performance of transition between the cloud RAN and the fog network has been presented and the subsequent switching strategy has been proposed to ensure engineering flexibility and success.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2509638","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

transmission to meet an important requirement for both driving safety and the simplicity of a receiver, mainly due to a time urgency issue. For this need, a concept called an additively uniquely decomposable constellation (signal amplitude set) group (AUDCG) is proposed in this paper to transmit multilayer data for VLC through constellation cooperation. Then, an optimal AUDCG is designed by minimizing the average optical power subject to a fixed minimum Euclidean distance. One of the significant advantages of this optimal design is fast demodulation of the sum signal from a noisy received signal, as well as fast decoding of individual signal from the estimated sum signal. Another important advantage is that this design allows each user constellation to be flexibly assigned to meet different priority requirements. Computer simulations indicate that our proposed design has better error performance than the currently available time-orthogonal transmission scheme for this application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-Cooperative Multilayer-Modulated VLC Systems for Automotive Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2509869","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7362283/07359098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2509869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7362283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Signal-Cooperative Multilayer-Modulated VLC Systems for Automotive Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7359098/","impactStatement":"The main contribution of this manuscript is that an additively uniquely decomposable constellation group (AUDCG) to transmit multi-layer data is proposed for visible light communications (VLC).

Markov Chain Monte Carlo in combination with Bayesian filtering is employed within the nonlinear state-space framework and demonstrated for parameter estimation. It is shown that the time-varying effects of cross-phase modulation (XPM) induced polarization scattering and phase noise can be formulated within the nonlinear state-space model (SSM). This allows for tracking and compensation of the XPM induced impairments by employing approximate stochastic filtering methods such as extended Kalman or particle filtering. The achievable gains are dependent on the autocorrelation (AC) function properties of the impairments under consideration which is strongly dependent on the transmissions scenario. The gain of the compensation method are therefore investigated by varying the parameters of the AC function describing XPM-induced polarization scattering and phase noise. It is shown that an increase in the nonlinear tolerance of more than 2 dB is achievable for 32 Gbaud QPSK and 16-quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM). It is also reviewed how laser rate equations can be formulated within the nonlinear state-space framework which allows for tracking of nonLorentzian laser phase noise lineshapes. It is experimentally demonstrated for 28 Gbaud 16-QAM signals that if the laser phase noise shape strongly deviates from the Lorentzian, phase noise tracking algorithms employing rate equation-based SSM result in a significant performance improvement (>8 dB) compared to traditional approaches using digital phase-locked loop. Finally, Gaussian mixture model is reviewed and employed for nonlinear phase noise compensation and characterization of nanoscale devices structure variations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2016","volume":"34","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15835807","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7359099/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning Techniques in Optical Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning Techniques in Optical Communication","sourcePdf":"jlt-zibar-2508502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122243S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7425116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"7425116","articleId":"7359099","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7359104,"authors":[{"name":"Le Thanh Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7359104/tan-2509449-small.gif","p":["Le Thanh Tan (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique\u2013\u00c9nergie Mat\u00e9riaux T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Canada, in 2015.

The proposed FD cognitive MAC (FDC-MAC) protocol does not require synchronization among SUs, and it efficiently utilizes the spectrum and mitigates the self-interference in the FD transceiver. We develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the FDC-MAC protocol, where both half-duplex (HD) transmission and FD transmission modes are considered in the transmission stage. Then, we study the FDC-MAC configuration optimization through adaptively controlling the spectrum sensing duration and transmit power level in the FD sensing stage. We prove that there exists optimal sensing time and transmit power to achieve the maximum throughput, and we develop an algorithm to configure the proposed FDC-MAC protocol. Extensive numerical results are presented to illustrate the optimal FDC-MAC configuration and the impacts of protocol parameters and the self-interference cancellation quality on the throughput performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the significant throughput gains of the FDC-MAC protocol with respect to the existing HD MAC and single-stage FD MAC protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2509449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07359104.pdf","startPage":"2715","endPage":"2729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2509449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Optimal Configuration of Full-Duplex MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks Considering Self-Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359104/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimal Configuration of Full-Duplex MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks Considering Self-Interference","volume":"3","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15656099","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359104/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design and Optimal Configuration of Full-Duplex MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks Considering Self-Interference","sourcePdf":"access-le-2509449-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180935S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7359104","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7359108,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan M.

The LIGHTNESS deeply programmable all-optical circuit and packet switched data plane is able to perform unicast/multicast switch-over on-demand, while the powerful software defined networking (SDN) control plane enables the virtualization of computing and network resources creating a virtual data center and virtual network functions (VNF) on top of the data plane. We experimentally demonstrate realistic intra DCN with deterministic latencies for both unicast and multicast, showcasing monitoring, and database migration scenarios each of which is enabled by an associated network function virtualization element. Results demonstrate a fully functional complete unification of an advanced optical data plane with an SDN control plane, promising more efficient management of the next-generation data center compute and network resources.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2509476","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7425125/07359113.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2509476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7425125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightness: A Function-Virtualizable Software Defined Data Center Network With All-Optical Circuit/Packet Switching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359113/","displayDocTitle":"Lightness: A Function-Virtualizable Software Defined Data Center Network With All-Optical Circuit/Packet Switching","volume":"34","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15823663","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359113/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EC FP7","grantNumber":"318606"},{"fundingName":"LIGHTNESS project"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/I01196X"},{"fundingName":"European Conference on Optical Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightness: A Function-Virtualizable Software Defined Data Center Network With All-Optical Circuit/Packet Switching","sourcePdf":"jlt-saridis-2509476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090623S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7425125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7425125","articleId":"7359113","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359133,"authors":[{"name":"Paula Diaz Reigosa","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7475920/7359133/reigo-2509643-small.gif","p":["Paula Diaz Reigosa (S\u201914) was born in Gijon, Spain.

However, there are still major challenges ahead to achieve a realistic bond wire lifetime prediction in field operation. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo based analysis method to predict the lifetime consumption of bond wires of IGBT modules in a photovoltaic (PV) inverter. The variations in IGBT parameters (e.g., on-state collector-emitter voltage), lifetime models, and environmental and operational stresses are taken into account in the lifetime prediction. The distribution of the annual lifetime consumption is estimated based on a long-term annual stress profile of solar irradiance and ambient temperature. The proposed method enables a more realistic lifetime prediction with a specified confidence level compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. A study case of IGBT modules in a 10-kW three-phase PV inverter is given to demonstrate the procedure of the method. The obtained results of the lifetime distribution can be used to justify the selection of IGBTs for the PV inverter applications and the corresponding risk of unreliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","volume":"31","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16003750","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7359133/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Bond Wire Fatigue of IGBTs in a PV Inverter Under a Long-Term Operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Bond Wire Fatigue of IGBTs in a PV Inverter Under a Long-Term Operation","sourcePdf":"tpel-diazreigosa-2509643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102753S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7475920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7475920","articleId":"7359133","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7359138,"authors":[{"name":"Xinhu Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7420563/7359138/zheng-2480157-small.gif","p":["\n\nXinhu Zheng received the B.S. degree in control science and engineering \nfrom Zhejiang University of China, Hangzhou, China, in 2011.

Although social data have been applied for transportation analysis, there are still many challenges. First, social data evolve with time and contain abundant information, posing a crucial need for data collection and cleaning. Meanwhile, each type of data has specific advantages and limitations for social transportation, and one data type alone is not capable of describing the overall state of a transportation system. Systematic data fusing approaches or frameworks for combining social signal data with different features, structures, resolutions, and precision are needed. Second, data processing and mining techniques, such as natural language processing and analysis of streaming data, require further revolutions in effective utilization of real-time traffic information. Third, social data are connected to cyber and physical spaces. To address practical problems in social transportation, a suite of schemes are demanded for realizing big data in social transportation systems, such as crowdsourcing, visual analysis, and task-based services. In this paper, we overview data sources, analytical approaches, and application systems for social transportation, and we also suggest a few future research directions for this new social transportation field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"17","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15806103","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7359138/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Big Data for Social Transportation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB352503"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61232012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61202279"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"NUS-ZJU SeSama center"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71232006, 61233001 and 61533019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007567","fundingName":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"fundingName":"CityU Start-up","grantNumber":"7200399"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2014A030313753"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71402157"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473320"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004806","fundingName":"Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation","grantNumber":"141075"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1343189"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Big Data for Social Transportation","sourcePdf":"tits-chenguesteditorsocialtransport-2480157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144442S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7420563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"7420563","articleId":"7359138","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7359141,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoyoshi Shimobaba","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Tomoyoshi Shimobaba received the Ph.D. degree in fast calculation of holography using special-purpose computer from Chiba University, Chiba, Japan, in 2002.","He is currently an Associate Professor with Chiba University.

The significant difference of this model from existing models is that all the realizations of channels, precoders, and decoders are fed back by finite rates. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) characteristic of this model is analyzed, which helps derive an upper bound of average throughput loss relative to perfect IA. The upper bound is shown to be tight by simulation, particularly in the high-feedback regime. Based on this result, the scaling laws of feedback bits for channels, precoding, and decoding vectors to obtain full degree of freedom are derived, which are backward compatible to the existing results for quantized CSI only or quantized precoder only. Simulation results show that the system is interference limited at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) if the three scaling laws are not simultaneously satisfied, and the throughput performance is dominantly limited by the worst feedback links among the channels, precoders, and decoders.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2509501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7590228/07359145.pdf","startPage":"8775","endPage":"8781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2509501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis of Interference Alignment for a General Centralized Limited Feedback Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359145/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis of Interference Alignment for a General Centralized Limited Feedback Model","volume":"65","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378715","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359145/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271234"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Program Foundation of Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"20123223110002"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Foundation of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2014D08"},{"fundingName":"CityU Strategic Research","grantNumber":"7004435"},{"fundingName":"Graduate Innovation Program","grantNumber":"CXZZ13_0485"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis of Interference Alignment for a General Centralized Limited Feedback Model","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2509501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064617S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7590228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7590228","articleId":"7359145","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359148,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios A.

By using conventional and modern protection trends, the aim of this paper is to propose the overcurrent protection based on the boundary discrete wavelet transform. In real time, this transformation decomposes a signal in the boundary scaling and wavelet coefficient energy. Following the conservative trends of power system protection, the instantaneous and time-delay overcurrent elements (phase and neutral units) are reproduced in the wavelet domain by using the boundary scaling coefficient energy, providing similar performance in the fault detection, a faster trip, and less computational burden than the conventional overcurrent protection. Following the modern protection trends, the boundary wavelet coefficient energy provides real-time detection of the fault inception time in order to reduce the relay operating time and minimize the harmful effects of the faults. A distribution system with DG was modeled in a real-time digital simulator, and wavelet-based overcurrent relays were evaluated and compared to conventional overcurrent relays based on the Fourier transform in real-time simulations, and promising results were obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2509460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7828064/07359149.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2509460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828064","startPage":"462","endPage":"473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcurrent Protection in Distribution Systems With Distributed Generation Based on the Real-Time Boundary Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overcurrent Protection in Distribution Systems With Distributed Generation Based on the Real-Time Boundary Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618277","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7359149/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcurrent Protection in Distribution Systems With Distributed Generation Based on the Real-Time Boundary Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-costa-2509460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082168S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7828064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7828064","articleId":"7359149","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359158,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi","affiliation":["EE Department, Sharitf University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, China"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Boloursaz Mashhadi","id":"37085711333"},{"name":"Ehsan Asadi","affiliation":["EE Department, Sharitf University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, China"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Asadi","id":"37829521400"},{"name":"Mohsen Eskandari","affiliation":["EE Department, Sharitf University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, China"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Eskandari","id":"37085374602"},{"name":"Shahrzad Kiani","affiliation":["EE Department, Sharitf University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, China"],"firstName":"Shahrzad","lastName":"Kiani","id":"37085700425"},{"name":"Farokh Marvasti","affiliation":["EE Department, Sharitf University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, China"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Marvasti","id":"37085377010"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7359158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2355},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This letter considers the problem of casual heart rate tracking during intensive physical exercise using simultaneous 2 channel photoplethysmographic (PPG) and 3 dimensional (3D) acceleration signals recorded from wrist. This is a challenging problem because the PPG signals recorded from wrist during exercise are contaminated by strong Motion Artifacts (MAs). In this work, a novel algorithm is proposed which consists of two main steps of MA Cancellation and Spectral Analysis. The MA cancellation step cleanses the MA-contaminated PPG signals utilizing the acceleration data and the spectral analysis step estimates a higher resolution spectrum of the signal and selects the spectral peaks corresponding to HR. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/hour showed that the proposed algorithm achieves an average absolute error of 1.25 beat per minute (BPM). These experimental results also confirm that the proposed algorithm keeps high estimation accuracies even in strong MA conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing

systems are constantly being developed to operate at higher baud rates and higher modulation formats. It then becomes inevitable to consider the various linear and nonlinear effects due to the imperfect components at the transmitter. State-of-the-art digital-to-analog converters, high bandwidth driver amplifiers, and dual-polarization (DP) Mach-Zehnder modulators are far from being ideal and present distortions in the form of bandwidth limitation, transmitter I/Q skew, and nonlinear effects. In this letter, we propose a new robust pre-distortion method to mitigate the undesirable linear and non-linear distortions of all electrical and optical transmitter components simultaneously. A step-by-step derivation and implementation of the algorithm are discussed and put forward. The performance of the algorithm is experimentally assessed across DP-4QAM, DP-8QAM, DP-16QAM, DP-32QAM, and DP-64QAM up to the signaling rates of 56 GBd. Significant improvements in the required optical signal-to-noise ratio at bit-error rate (BER) of 10-2 are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2015.2509158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7419307/07359160.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2015.2509158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Adaptive Pre-Distortion Method for Optical Communication Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359160/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Adaptive Pre-Distortion Method for Optical Communication Transmitters","volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 April1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15803042","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359160/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the EUREKA Project SASER","grantNumber":"01BP12300A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Adaptive Pre-Distortion Method for Optical Communication Transmitters","sourcePdf":"lpt-khanna-2509158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073153S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7419307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7419307","articleId":"7359160","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359163,"authors":[{"name":"Nilanjan Mukherjee","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical, and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7428980/7359163/mukhe-2509911-small.gif","p":["Nilanjan Mukherjee (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering (with a specialization in power electronics) from the University of Aston, Birmingham, U.K., in 2014.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Aston University after completion of his Ph.D. degree for a brief period.

These hybrid battery solutions may contain different battery types. A dc-side cascaded boost converters along with a module-based distributed power sharing strategy has been proposed to cope with variations in battery parameters such as, state-of-charge (SOC) and/or capacity. This power sharing strategy distributes the total power among the different battery modules according to these battery parameters. Each module controller consists of an outer voltage-loop with an inner current-loop where the desired control reference for each control-loop needs to be dynamically varied according to battery parameters to undertake this sharing. As a result, the designed control bandwidth (BW) or stability margin of each module control-loop may vary in a wide range, which can cause a stability problem within the cascaded converter. This paper reports such a unique issue and thoroughly investigates the stability of the modular converter under the distributed sharing scheme. The paper shows that a cascaded PI control-loop approach cannot guarantee the system stability throughout the operating conditions. A detailed analysis of the stability issue and the limitations of the conventional approach are highlighted. Finally in-depth experimental results are presented to prove the stability issue using a modular hybrid battery energy storage system prototype under various operating conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter-Based Hybrid Battery Energy Storage Systems\u2014Part I: Stability Issue","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2509911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7428980/07359163.pdf","startPage":"2340","endPage":"2349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2509911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Control of Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter-Based Hybrid Battery Energy Storage Systems\u2014Part I: Stability Issue","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7359163/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15837344","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K.","grantNumber":"EP/1008764/1 and EP/137649"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Cascaded DC\u2013DC Converter-Based Hybrid Battery Energy Storage Systems\u2014Part I: Stability Issue","sourcePdf":"tie-mukherjee-2509911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098642S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7359163","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7359164,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Gu","affiliation":["Service Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/7869240/7359164/gu-2508382-small.gif","p":["Lin Gu received the B.S. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2009, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.

As a growing healthcare trend, medical cyber-physical systems (MCPSs) enable seamless and intelligent interaction between the computational elements and the medical devices. To support MCPSs, cloud resources are usually explored to process the sensing data from medical devices. However, the high quality-of-service of MCPS challenges the unstable and long-delay links between cloud data center and medical devices. To combat this issue, mobile edge cloud computing, or fog computing, which pushes the computation resources onto the network edge (e.g., cellular base stations), emerges as a promising solution. We are thus motivated to integrate fog computation and MCPS to build fog computing supported MCPS (FC-MCPS). In particular, we jointly investigate base station association, task distribution, and virtual machine placement toward cost-efficient FC-MCPS. We first formulate the problem into a mixed-integer non-linear linear program and then linearize it into a mixed integer linear programming (LP). To address the computation complexity, we further propose an LP-based two-phase heuristic algorithm. Extensive experiment results validate the high-cost efficiency of our algorithm by the fact that it produces near optimal solution and significantly outperforms a greedy algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2508382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7869240/07359164.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2508382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Efficient Resource Management in Fog Computing Supported Medical Cyber-Physical System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359164","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6245516/7869240/7359164-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Cost Efficient Resource Management in Fog Computing Supported Medical Cyber-Physical System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359164/","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16721774","htmlLink":"/document/7359164/","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"Strategic International Collaborative Research Program\u2014Japan Science and Technology Agency\u2014U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Joint Research on Big Data and Disaster Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61402425 and 61501412"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004701","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for National University, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China","grantNumber":"CUG14065 and CUGL150829"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Cost Efficient Resource Management in Fog Computing Supported Medical Cyber-Physical System","sourcePdf":"tetc-guo-2508382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113391S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7869240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"7869240","articleId":"7359164","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7359169,"authors":[{"name":"Louis-Marie Saublet","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nancy, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7428980/7359169/saubl-2509908-small.gif","p":["Louis-Marie Saublet received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019Electricit\u00e9 et de M\u00e9canique, Nancy, France, in 2012.

This paper considers a CPD model having structured matrix factors, as e.g. Toeplitz, Hankel or circulant matrices, and studies its associated estimation problem. This model arises in signal processing applications such as Wiener-Hammerstein system identification and cumulant-based wireless communication channel estimation. After introducing a general formulation of the considered structured CPD (SCPD), we derive closed-form expressions for the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) of its parameters under the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Formulas for special cases of interest, as when the CPD contains identical factors, are also provided. Aiming at a more relevant statistical evaluation from a practical standpoint, we discuss the application of our formulas in a Bayesian context, where prior distributions are assigned to the model parameters. Three existing algorithms for computing SCPDs are then described: a constrained alternating least squares (CALS) algorithm, a subspace-based solution and an algebraic solution for SCPDs with circulant factors. Subsequently, we present three numerical simulation scenarios, in which several specialized estimators based on these algorithms are proposed for concrete examples of SCPD involving circulant factors. In particular, the third scenario concerns the identification of a Wiener-Hammerstein system via the SCPD of an associated Volterra kernel. The statistical performance of the proposed estimators is assessed via Monte Carlo simulations, by comparing their Bayesian mean-square error with the expected CRB.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7469412/07359173.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2509907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2509907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor CP Decomposition With Structured Factor Matrices: Algorithms and Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Signal processing algorithms","Matrix decomposition","Bayes methods","Estimation","Context","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Gaussian noise","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","Monte Carlo methods","radio networks","signal processing","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor CP decomposition","structured factor matrices","canonical polyadic decomposition","Candecomp/Parafac","multidimensional data analysis","CPD model","matrix factors","circulant matrices","associated estimation problem","wireless communication channel estimation","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","CRB","Gaussian noise","statistical evaluation","Bayesian context","Wiener-Hammerstein system","Volterra kernel","statistical performance","Monte Carlo simulations","Bayesian mean-square error","applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor","CP decomposition","structured matrices","Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","displayDocTitle":"Tensor CP Decomposition With Structured Factor Matrices: Algorithms and Performance","volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7359173/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15989010","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"AdG-2013-320594 DECODA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor CP Decomposition With Structured Factor Matrices: Algorithms and Performance","sourcePdf":"jstsp-goulart-2509907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103286S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"7469412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7469412","articleId":"7359173","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359175,"authors":[{"name":"Bangcheng Han","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering, and Beijing Engineering Research Center of High-Speed Magnetically Suspended Motor Technology and Application, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7428980/7359175/bahan-2509905-small.gif","p":["Bangcheng Han (M\u201912) was born in 1974.

In this paper, the design principle and the initial model of CRAMB are introduced. To improve the performances of CRAMB and better meet the engineering requirements, the optimization is conducted on the bearing. Considering the incompatible objectives of the optimization model, the method of multiobjective optimization (MOO) on the bearing is proposed, which can balance these objectives compared with single-objective optimization (SOO). The objectives and constraints are provided in the form of analytical expressions by means of equivalent magnetic circuit whose rationality is demonstrated by finite-element method (FEM). To optimize the bearing efficiently, the integrated optimum methodology is adopted. After MOO process, the synthetical performances are improved, which are verified by FEM and experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15837347","htmlLink":"/document/7359175/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Combined Radial-Axial Magnetic Bearing for Magnetically Suspended Compressor","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573032"},{"fundingName":"National Major Project for the Development and Application of Scientific Instrument Equipment of China","grantNumber":"2012YQ040235"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Combined Radial-Axial Magnetic Bearing for Magnetically Suspended Compressor","sourcePdf":"tie-han-2509905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09921S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7428980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7428980","articleId":"7359175","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359179,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Brusilovsky","affiliation":["School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Peter Brusilovsky (SM\u201914) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Moscow Lomonosov State University, in 1983 and 1987, respectively.

A recent extension of OSM known as open social student modeling (OSSM) complements cognitive aspects of OSM with social aspects by allowing students to explore models of peer students and/or an aggregated class model. In this paper, we introduce an OSSM interface, MasteryGrids, and report the results of a large-scale classroom study, which explored the impact of the social dimension of OSSM. Students in a database management course accessed nonrequired learning materials (examples and problems) via the MasteryGrids interface using either OSM or OSSM. The results revealed that OSSM-enhanced learning, especially for students with lower prior knowledge, compared with OSM. It also enhanced user attitude and engagement. Amount of student usage, efficiency of student usage, and student attitude varied depending on the combination of interface condition (OSM/OSSM), gender, and student social comparison orientation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2016","volume":"4","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16282794","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7359179/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Open Social Student Modeling for Personalized Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative"},{"fundingName":"Turkish Fulbright Commission"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative"},{"fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey through the 2219 Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship Program"},{"fundingName":"National Commission for Science Research and Technology, Chile"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Open Social Student Modeling for Personalized Learning","sourcePdf":"tetc-somyurek-2501243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106132S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7558276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7558276","articleId":"7359179","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7359181,"authors":[{"name":"Li Sun","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7398213/7359181/lisun-2509442-small.gif","p":["Li Sun (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communications engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","Since January 2012, he has been with the Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, as an Assistant Professor.

However, due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation, it is challenging to guarantee the secrecy of cooperative transmissions under eavesdropping attacks. To deal with this issue, a fountain-coding aided relaying scheme is proposed in this paper, for which all the source packets are first encoded with fountain codes (FCs) and then transmitted over the channels. Based on the basic characteristic of FC transmissions, a sufficient number of coded packets have to be successfully received to recover the original data. Therefore, transmission secrecy is guaranteed if the legitimate receiver can accumulate the required number of FC packets before the eavesdropper does. To satisfy this condition, a cooperative jamming method is utilized to worsen the received signal quality at the eavesdropper. By applying the constellation rotation approach, the information-bearing signal and the jamming signal are designed carefully to reduce the negative effect of the jamming procedure on the legitimate receiver. To evaluate how the scheme behaves in wireless fading channels, the authors propose a novel performance metric, i.e., the quality-of-service violating probability (QVP), and derive its closed-form expression. Compared to the commonly used metrics in physical-layer security such as secrecy outage probability, QVP can give a more comprehensive performance evaluation for the system, including the delay, the reliability, and the security level as well. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fountain-Coding Aided Strategy for Secure Cooperative Transmission in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2509442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7398213/07359181.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2509442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Fountain-Coding Aided Strategy for Secure Cooperative Transmission in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7359181/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755385","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61431011"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"2012D04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Fountain-Coding Aided Strategy for Secure Cooperative Transmission in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-ren-2509442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068234S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7398213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7398213","articleId":"7359181","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359182,"authors":[{"name":"Bong-Ki Lee","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7370838/7359182/7359182-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bong-Ki Lee was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1986.

Once the training is accomplished by the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)-based pre-training to initialize the DNN, minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based fine tuning is then performed based on the back-propagation algorithm. In the reconstruction stage, the trained DNN model is fed with the features of the previous frames in order to estimate the log-power spectra and phases of the missing frames. Reconstruction is further improved by using the cross-fading technique to mitigate discontinuity between the reconstruction signal and good frame signal in the time-domain. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, hidden Markov model (HMM)-based PLC algorithm and the PLC algorithm standardized in adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) Appendix I were used for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed approach provides better speech quality and speech recognition accuracy than the conventional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2015.2509780","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7370838/07359182.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2015.2509780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7370838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet Loss Concealment Based on Deep Neural Networks for Digital Speech Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359182/","displayDocTitle":"Packet Loss Concealment Based on Deep Neural Networks for Digital Speech Transmission","volume":"24","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359182/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15695018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A1A10049735"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet Loss Concealment Based on Deep Neural Networks for Digital Speech Transmission","sourcePdf":"taslp-chang-2509780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170122S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"2016-6570655","isNumber":"7370838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7370838","articleId":"7359182","onlineDate":"17 December 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7359208,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshinobu Tamura","affiliation":["Yamaguchi University, Ube-shi, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinobu","lastName":"Tamura","id":"37556284500"},{"name":"Shigeru Yamada","affiliation":["Tottori University, Tottori-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37288395000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7231-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7230-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359208","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":649},"abstract":"Considering the software reliability of cloud computing, it is important for the software managers to assess the relationship between the database software and cloud software, because the cloud software collaborate closely with the database software by using the internet network.

If this happens in a location where a potentially flammable atmosphere is present, a hazardous situation can occur. However, the possibility of ignition will depend on many factors, particularly whether the spark can deliver sufficient energy to ignite a particular flammable atmosphere. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present the likelihood of ignition of fuel and solvent vapors due to the presence of RF transmitters, inadvertent ignition of Electro Explosive Devices (EEDs), explosives and to recommend the limits for use of mobile phones during Handling, Assembly and Integration of Rocket motors and also during Flight trials. The frequency range covered is 9 KHz to 60 GHz. Ignition of flammable atmosphere has been assessed as per British Standard BS 6656:2002. Inadvertent ignition of EEDs is also assessed as per US Army \u201cExplosives Safety Standard\u201d. As a result, safe distances have been arrived at and reported in the present work.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Ignition","Radio

Maintenance effort using neural networks","abstract":"Software Maintenance is an important phase of software development lifecycle, which starts once the software has been deployed at the customer's end. A lot of maintenance effort is required to change the software after it is in operation. Therefore, predicting the effort and cost associated with the maintenance activities such as correcting and fixing the defects has become one of the key issues that need to be analyzed for effective resource allocation and decision-making. In view of this issue, we have developed a model based on text mining techniques using machine learning method namely, Radial Basis Function of neural network. We apply text mining techniques to identify the relevant attributes from defect reports and relate these relevant attributes to software maintenance effort prediction. The proposed model is validated using `Browser' application package of Android Operating System. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis is done to interpret the results obtained from model prediction by using the value of Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity and a suitable threshold criterion known as the cut-off point. It is evident from the results that the performance of the model is dependent on the number of words considered for classification and therefore shows the best results with respect to top-100 words. The performance is irrespective of the type of effort category.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359258/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15663676","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359258/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predicting Software Maintenance effort using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Software Maintenance effort using neural networks","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"Paper43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115879S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7321997","isNumber":"7359191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7321997","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7359191","articleId":"7359258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7359330,"authors":[{"name":"Pratima Manhas","affiliation":["FET, ECE Deptt, Manav Rachna International University, Faridabad, India"],"firstName":"Pratima","lastName":"Manhas","id":"37085662912"},{"name":"M.K Soni","affiliation":["FET Manav Rachna International University, Faridabad, India"],"firstName":"M.K","lastName":"Soni","id":"37863457200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7231-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7230-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359330","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a type of multicarrier modulation (MCM) technique which plays an important role in 4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n generation of wireless network.

Some of the important objectives of a smart grid include improving energy efficiency, maximizing utility, reducing cost, and controlling emission. Smart grids use demand response as an effective strategy to address this challenge. Demand response uses real time scheduling to enable customers to modify their demand according to energy consumption costs. In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient scheduling of energy consumption of users in a smart grid. Efficient energy management involves tradeoffs between the cost associated with energy consumption and a utility function. The utility function can represent the living comfort of users or gross income of the utility company. The utility function is non decreasing with respect to total utilized power. Hence, it is important to understand the tradeoffs between energy consumption and utility. The main contribution of this work is the development of a multi-objective optimization framework for efficient energy scheduling in smart grids. A recently developed multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called the evolutionary multi-objective crowding algorithm (EMOCA) is adapted for simultaneously optimizing the energy cost and utility function subject to a constraint on the power generation capacity. Simulation results show that EMOCA demonstrates the advantages of multi-objective optimization and outperforms a widely used and well known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IGESC.2015.7359383","startPage":"7","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Green Energy and Systems Conference (IGESC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGESC.2015.7359383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359379","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Green Energy and Systems Conference (IGESC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7359187/7359379/07359383.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective optimization approach for efficient energy management in smart grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359383/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization approach for efficient energy management in smart grids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359383/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15678987","publicationDate":"9 Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2015","conferenceDate":"9-9 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Nov. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization approach for efficient energy management in smart grids","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p7-rajagopalan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065261S","chronDate":"9-9 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7359187","isNumber":"7359379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7359187","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7359379","articleId":"7359383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7359390,"authors":[{"name":"Tairen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Tairen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085692972"},{"name":"Olga Lavrova","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Lavrova","id":"37063717300"},{"name":"Jane Lehr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Lehr","id":"37272080700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7263-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7262-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359390","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Uncertainty","Sensitivity","Integrated circuit modeling","Reactive power","Generators","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","power distribution planning","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load analysis","population initialization space","PV panels","capacitor bank","synchronous compensator","Pareto front","fuzzy logic decision model","reactive power losses","voltage deviations","voltage sensitivity analysis","frequency factor","cloudy index","load uncertainty","daily summer load data","photovoltaic panels","NSGA-II","modified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II","distributed generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359390","abstract":"This paper proposes an optimal method to plan and dynamically operate the distributed generation (DG) based on the modified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). First, the uncertainty of load and DG (photovoltaic panels) output are considered. Daily summer load data and ideal photovoltaic (PV) panels output data are taken from a local electrical company in Albuquerque. To model the uncertainty of load, the daily load is randomized to each bus for every time interval (15 minutes), but with their sum equal to the daily load. The uncertainty of PV output is modeled by adding the cloudy index and frequency factor to the ideal PV output. Second, the placement of a DG is defined by voltage sensitivity analysis. The bus with high voltage sensitivity is considered to have priority for the installation of DG. To find the optimal daily operation of DG, a multiobjective problem is formulated that focuses on the minimization of a circuit's voltage deviations, active and reactive power losses. To solve the problem, the traditional NSGA II is modified by incorporating a fuzzy logic decision model. The fuzzy logic model selects an optimally compromised solution from the Pareto front by analyzing its weights of voltage deviations, active and reactive power losses. The selected solution includes the optimal outputs for every generator, synchronous compensator, capacitor bank, and PV panels for each time interval. Furthermore, to operate DG optimally and dynamically, the method's computation speed is crucial. To increase the modified NSGA II computation speed, the population initialization space is reduced and the population is selected and saved for the next generation based on load analysis and experiments. The method is tested on the IEEE 14 bus and a local residential circuit. The results on reducing the power losses, voltage deviations, and increasing the algorithm speed demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.","doi":"10.1109/IGESC.2015.7359390","pdfPath":"/iel7/7359187/7359379/07359390.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Green Energy and Systems Conference (IGESC)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Green Energy and Systems Conference (IGESC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGESC.2015.7359390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The optimal planning and dynamic operation of distributed generation method based on modified multiobjective optimization in power distribution system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"The optimal planning and dynamic operation of distributed generation method based on modified multiobjective optimization in power distribution system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15678978","publicationDate":"9 Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7359390/","conferenceDate":"9-9 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The optimal planning and dynamic operation of distributed generation method based on modified multiobjective optimization in power distribution system","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p49-chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059898S","chronDate":"9-9 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7359187","isNumber":"7359379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7359187","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7359379","articleId":"7359390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7359435,"authors":[{"name":"Minho Han","affiliation":["Cyber Security Research Laboratory, Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Minho","lastName":"Han","id":"37416848700"},{"name":"Ikkyun Kim","affiliation":["Cyber Security Research Laboratory, Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Ikkyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37597615500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-908320-50-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-908320-49-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359435","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data reduction","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection method","network pattern analysis","false positive reduction","network intrusion detection system","NIDS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network pattern alanysis of process","anonaly based detection","clustering"]}],"abstract":"The only solution against zero day attack is the anomaly based detection independent of specific signatures.

A detailed characterization of the precise yet complex relationship between protein structure, dynamics, and function requires elucidating transitions between functionally-relevant states. Doing so challenges both wet and dry laboratories, as protein dynamics involves disparate temporal scales. In this paper we present a novel, sampling-based algorithm to compute transition paths. The algorithm exploits two main ideas. First, it leverages known structures to initialize its search and define a reduced conformation space for rapid sampling. This is key to address the insufficient sampling issue suffered by sampling-based algorithms. Second, the algorithm embeds samples in a nearest-neighbor graph where transition paths can be efficiently computed via queries. The algorithm adapts the probabilistic roadmap framework that is popular in robot motion planning. In addition to efficiently computing lowest-cost paths between any given structures, the algorithm allows investigating hypotheses regarding the order of experimentally-known structures in a transition event. This novel contribution is likely to open up new venues of research. Detailed analysis is presented on multiple-basin proteins of relevance to human disease. Multiscaling and the AMBER ff12SB force field are used to obtain energetically-credible paths at atomistic detail.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing transition paths in multiple-basin proteins with a probabilistic roadmap algorithm guided by structure data","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359652","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359652.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Computing transition paths in multiple-basin proteins with a probabilistic roadmap algorithm guided by structure data","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359652/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668422","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing transition paths in multiple-basin proteins with a probabilistic roadmap algorithm guided by structure data","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000005B376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06687S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359681,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085345259"},{"name":"Li Liao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liao","id":"37284247700"},{"name":"Cathy H.

However, how to quickly learn weights for heterogeneous data sources remains a challenge. In this work, we developed a method to infer de novo PPIs by combining multiple data sources represented in kernel format and obtaining optimal weights based on random walk over the existing partial network. Our proposed method utilizes Baker algorithm and the training data to construct a transition matrix which constrains how a random walk would traverse the partial network. Multiple heterogeneous features for the proteins in the network, including gene expression and Pfam domain profiles, are then combined into the form of a weighted kernel, which provides a new \u201cadjacency matrix\u201d for the whole network but is required to comply with the transition matrix on the part of the training subnetwork. This requirement is met by adjusting the weights to minimize the element-wise difference between the transition matrix and the weighted kernel. The minimization problem is solved by linear programming. The weighted kernel is then transformed to regularized Laplacian (RL) kernel to infer missing or new edges in the PPI network. The results on synthetic data and real data from Yeast show that the accuracy of PPI prediction measured by AUC is increased by up to 19% as compared to a control method without using optimal weights. Moreover, the weights learned by our method Weight Optimization by Linear Programming (WOLP) are very consistent with that learned by sampling, and can provide insights into the relations between PPIs and various feature kernels, thereby improving PPI prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine

Recent studies have shown that enhancer elements could be enriched for certain histone modification combinatorial codes, leading to interest in developing computational models to predict enhancer locations. Here we present EP-DNN, a protocol for predicting enhancers based on chromatin features, in two different cell types, a human embryonic (H1) and a human lung fibroblast (IMR90) cell line. Specifically, we use a deep neural network (DNN)-based architecture to extract enhancer signatures. We train EP-DNN using distal p300 binding sites, as enhancers, and TSS and random non-DNase-I hypersensitivity sites, as non-enhancers. We find that EP-DNN has superior accuracy relative to other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as DEEP-EN and RFECS, and also scales well to large number of predictions. Then, we surmount the problem that DNN results are not interpretable and develop a method to interpret which histone modifications are important, and within that, which spatial features proximal or distal to the enhancer site, are important. We uncover that the important histone modifications vary between cell types. Further, whether the important features are clustered around the enhancer peak or more spread out also differs among the different histone modifications. Thus, we bring forth a new paradigm for automatically determining the important features and the important histone modifications, rather than the current computational standard of using the same fixed number of features from all the histone modifications for all cell types. Our results have implications for computational scientists who can now do feature selection for their classification task and for biologists who can now experimentally collect data only for the relevant histone modifications.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359687.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpretable deep neural networks for enhancer prediction","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interpretable deep neural networks for enhancer prediction","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668378","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7359687/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpretable deep neural networks for enhancer prediction","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000040B506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08258S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359713,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jing Chen","id":"37087251977"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Bin Hu","id":"37087069092"},{"name":"Lixin Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lixin Xu","id":"37085966625"},{"name":"Philip Moore","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Moore","id":"37308054900"},{"name":"Yun Su","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yun Su","id":"37087765804"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6799-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359713","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":762},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Physiology","Biomedical imaging","Brain models","Electroencephalography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","emotion recognition","hidden Markov models","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature-level fusion","multimodal physiological signal","emotion recognition","multimodal feature fusion","feature selection","Fisher criterion score","Davies-Bouldin index","valence-arousal emotion space","hidden Markov model","HMM","electroencephalogram","EEG","central nervous system","peripheral physiological signal","PERI","peripheral nervous system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multimodal physiological signals","information fusion","emotion recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359713","abstract":"Objective: This paper aims to use multimodal physiological signals to automatically recognize human emotions, and a novel multimodal feature fusion approach is proposed. Methods: In the proposed approach, significant multimodal features are selected respectively by two comparative feature selection methods: Fisher Criterion Score and Davies-Bouldin index. Emotion recognition is performed on the valence-arousal emotion space by using hidden Markov models (HMMs) and multimodal feature sets. Four physiological modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG) from central nervous system and peripheral physiological signals (PERI) from peripheral nervous system as shown in the DEAP database, are employed. Results: We show the best recognition accuracies of 85.63% for arousal and 83.98% for valence. The proposed feature fusion approach is compared with decision-level fusion and non-fusion approaches on the same database; and the comparison demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy obtained by the feature fusion approach. Conclusion: Our work supports the observation that the proposed feature-level fusion approach represents a promising methodology for emotion recognition.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359713","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359713.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"399","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature-level fusion of multimodal physiological signals for emotion recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Feature-level fusion of multimodal physiological signals for emotion recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15668366","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7359713/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature-level fusion of multimodal physiological signals for emotion recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC","sourcePdf":"00000066B230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047527S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7359722,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal M.

Traditional regression techniques are challenged by these censored samples. In such problems the true target times of a majority of instances are unknown; what is known is a censored target representing some earlier indeterminate time. Such censored samples can be considered as semi-supervised targets; however most efforts in semi-supervised regression do not take into account the partial nature of unsupervised information; samples are treated as either fully labelled or unlabeled. In this work we extend a novel transduction approach for semi-supervised survival analysis to neural networks. The true target times are approximated from the censored times through transduction. For prostate and breast cancer applications, this semi-supervised regression framework yields a significant improvement in performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359722/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15655594","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359722/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Survival analysis via transduction for semi-supervised neural networks in medical prognosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survival analysis via transduction for semi-supervised neural networks in medical prognosis","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000075B382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057444S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7359724,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Hui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Hui-Hui Wang","id":"37085613281"},{"name":"Jia-Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jia-Ming Liu","id":"38239966900"},{"name":"Mingyu You","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Mingyu You","id":"37591779500"},{"name":"Guo-Zheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Zheng Li","id":"37292279500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6799-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359724","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","diseases","medical image processing","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RASTA-PLP spectrum","image processing technology","respiratory disease diagnosis","respiratory disease assessment","clinical value","cough detection","convolutional neural network","cough classification","audio signal encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cough detection","audio features","convolutional neural networks","image processing","cough classification"]}],"abstract":"Cough detection has considerable clinical value, which can provide an objective basis for assessment and diagnosis of respiratory diseases.

In order to explore the optimal audio signals encoding method, we performed comparative experiments on medical dataset containing 70000 audio segments from 26 patients. Experimental results show that RASTA-PLP spectrum is the best method to encode audio signals as images with respect to cough classification task, which gives an average accuracy of 0.9965 in 200 iterations on test batches and a F1-score of 0.9768 on samples re-sampled from the test set.

We implemented a supervised learning approach to support screening tasks, by automatically flagging potentially selected documents in a list retrieved by a literature database search. To overcome the main issues associated with the automatic literature screening task, we evaluated the use of data sampling, feature combinations, and feature selection methods, generating a total of 105 classification models. The models yielding best results were composed by the Logistic Model Trees classifier, a fairly balanced training set, and feature combination of Bag-Of-Words and MeSH terms.

Well-established NGS data analysis software tools, in their unmodified form, can take days to identify and interpret single nucleotide and structural variations in DNA for a single patient. To improve sample analysis throughput, we developed a highly parallel end-to-end next-generation DNA sequencing data analysis pipeline in Hadoop. In our pipeline, each step is parallelized not only across samples but also within each individual sample, achieving a 30\u00d7 speedup over a single server workflow execution. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate the viability of having our Hadoop-based pipeline as part of a larger commercial genomic services offering-we demonstrate how our pipeline scales sub-linearly both with the number of samples being analyzed and with the depth of coverage of those samples. In particular, on our commodity cluster, 10\u00d7 as many samples resulted in only a 2.24\u00d7 increase in the execution time, and a 4\u00d7 increase in coverage depth resulted in only a 2.53\u00d7 growth in execution time. We anticipate that such improvements will allow large cohort populations to be analyzed in parallel, and can fundamentally change the way DNA sequencing analyses are used by both researchers and clinicians.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359781.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"763","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly parallel next-generation DNA sequencing data analysis pipeline in Hadoop","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Pipelines","Sequential analysis","Parallel processing","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","DNA","genetics","medical computing","medicine","parallel processing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel next-generation DNA sequencing","data analysis pipeline","precision medicine","next-generation sequencing technologies","disease diagnosis","therapeutic selection","NGS data analysis software tools","single nucleotide","structural variations","sample analysis","Hadoop-based pipeline","commercial genomic services","commodity cluster","DNA sequencing analyses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NGS","Hadoop","bioinformatics infrastructure","high-performance computing","scalability","DNA","exome","genome"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A highly parallel next-generation DNA sequencing data analysis pipeline in Hadoop","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359781/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668442","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly parallel next-generation DNA sequencing data analysis pipeline in Hadoop","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000134N201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073674S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359790,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Azari","affiliation":["Department of Information System, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Azari","id":"37085565996"},{"name":"Vandana P.

Patients with long stays (i.e., those with LOS longer than 14 hours) comprise 10% percent of ED visits, but utilize 30% of the total ED bed hours. Accurately predicting patients' LOS can be used to improve resource management both in the ED and the hospital. A prediction model that can identify this minority, prolonged stay patient group, early at presentation may be effective in addressing barriers to expedited treatment and ED disposition. However, this is a challenging task because regular classification techniques are biased toward the majority group of examples and tend to overlook the minority class examples. This problem can be alleviated by using class imbalance learning methods. In this paper, we present a framework that predicts patients with prolonged ED stays (> 14 hours) from data available at triage (i.e., presentation). The framework also enables extraction of independent variables that capture the current state of the resources in the ED. Predictions combine patient information (e.g., demographics, complaints, and vital signs) with a snapshot of resources and queuing metrics in the ED which can substantially impact the LOS. The prediction models in our framework are developed from over one hundred thousand ED encounters retrospectively collected at an urban hospital. Our experimental results demonstrate that we accurately predict prolonged ED length of stay and provide a clear interpretation of the factors that influence it. We also found that integrating a class imbalance learning ensemble method into our framework produces much better results for prolonged stays than only using traditional logistic regression methods.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359790","startPage":"807","endPage":"814","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359790.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imbalanced learning to predict long stay Emergency Department patients","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Imbalanced learning to predict long stay Emergency Department patients","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359790/","accessionNumber":"15678020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359790/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imbalanced learning to predict long stay Emergency Department patients","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000143S1208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097658S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7359793,"authors":[{"name":"DuyHoa Ngo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University, Singapore"],"firstName":"DuyHoa","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37085586282"},{"name":"Bharadwaj Veeravalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bharadwaj","lastName":"Veeravalli","id":"37274109000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6799-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Telemetry","Clustering algorithms","Monitoring","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["morphology-based anomaly detection method","ECG stream","electrocardiography","autotriggered cardiac event monitoring system","online processing","computing device","sensor network","heart beat morphology","time-series data mining technique","statistical outlier detection method","open public QT database"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection from ECG stream is a key step leading to a significant success of the remote and auto-triggered cardiac event monitoring system.

It is difficult to obtain an orientation into their structure and content. In previous research we designed compact summary networks called partial-area taxonomies to provide a structural summary of a terminology. The sizes of a terminology and of its partial-area taxonomy are defined as their numbers of nodes. While a partial-area taxonomy is typically smaller than the original terminology, it is often not compact enough to provide a clear \u201cbig picture,\u201d due to too many nodes that summarize only a small number of terminology concepts. The display of such a partial-area taxonomy is still overwhelming. In this paper, we introduce a more compact summary of a terminology, called an aggregate taxonomy, obtained by aggregating small partial-area taxonomy nodes into larger nodes. We present a parametrized technique to study the design of such an aggregate taxonomy and apply it to the Specimen hierarchy of SNOMED CT. A software tool for creating and displaying aggregate taxonomies is described. We illustrate how aggregate taxonomies derived across multiple SNOMED CT releases can be used to summarize the evolution of the Specimen hierarchy's content over eight years of SNOMED CT releases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7359822/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15668232","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using aggregate taxonomies to summarize SNOMED CT evolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using aggregate taxonomies to summarize SNOMED CT evolution","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000175B345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083843S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359832,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Liu","affiliation":["Mind Research Network, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085338702"},{"name":"Jiayu Chen","affiliation":["Mind Research Network, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jiayu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37859011000"},{"name":"Vince D.

However, studying the flexibility of large proteins with hundreds or thousands of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) remains a big challenge. Large proteins are also highly-constrained systems, which makes them more challenging for standard robotic approaches. So-called \"expansive\" motion planning algorithms were specifically developed to address highly-dimensional and highly-constrained problems. Many such planners employ a low-dimensional projection to estimate exploration coverage and direct their search based on this information. We believe that such a projection plays an essential role in the success of these planners. This paper shows how the low-dimensional projection used by expansive planners can be tailored with respect to a given molecular system to enhance the process of conformational sampling. We introduce a methodology to generate an expert projection using any available information about a given protein. We evaluate this methodology on several conformational search problems involving proteins with hundreds of DoFs. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating expert knowledge into the projection can significantly benefit the exploration process.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359863","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1279","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359863.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving protein conformational sampling by using guiding projections","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving protein conformational sampling by using guiding projections","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359863/","accessionNumber":"15668397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359863/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving protein conformational sampling by using guiding projections","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000216B341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107763S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359869,"authors":[{"name":"Noah Stier","affiliation":["Department of Neurology Univerisity of California, Neurovascular Imaging Research Core, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Noah","lastName":"Stier","id":"37085665045"},{"name":"Nicholas Vincent","affiliation":["Department of Neurology Univerisity of California, Neurovascular Imaging Research Core, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Vincent","id":"37085675808"},{"name":"David Liebeskind","affiliation":["Department of Neurology Univerisity of California, Neurovascular Imaging Research Core, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Liebeskind","id":"38542127700"},{"name":"Fabien Scalzo","affiliation":["Department of Neurology Univerisity of California, Neurovascular Imaging Research Core, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Scalzo","id":"37550582800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6799-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359869","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":659},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning of tissue fate features in acute ischemic stroke","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359869.pdf","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1321","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359869","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Convolution","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical MRI","decision making","image fusion","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","tissue fate features","acute ischemic stroke treatment","tissue survival outcome prediction","clinical decision-making process","endovascular clot-retrieval intervention","hypoperfusion feature","MRI","tissue fate prediction","regional learning framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359869","abstract":"In acute ischemic stroke treatment, prediction of tissue survival outcome plays a fundamental role in the clinical decision-making process, as it can be used to assess the balance of risk vs. possible benefit when considering endovascular clot-retrieval intervention.

However, post-sequencing DNA analysis has become the bottleneck in using these data sets, as it requires powerful and scalable tools to perform the needed analysis. A typical analysis pipeline consists of a number of steps, not all of which can readily scale on a distributed computing infrastructure. Recently, tools like Halvade, a Hadoop MapReduce solution, and Churchill, an HPC cluster-based solution, addressed this issue of scalability in the GATK DNA analysis pipeline. In this paper, we present a framework that implements an in-memory distributed version of the GATK pipeline using Apache Spark. Our framework reduced execution time by keeping data active in the memory between the map and reduce steps. In addition, it has a dynamic load balancing algorithm that better utilizes system performance using runtime statistics of the active workload. Experiments on a 4 node cluster with 64 virtual cores show that this approach is 63% faster than a Hadoop MapReduce based solution.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359893","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359893.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-based Apache Spark implementation of the GATK DNA analysis pipeline","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-based Apache Spark implementation of the GATK DNA analysis pipeline","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359893/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668364","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7359893/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-based Apache Spark implementation of the GATK DNA analysis pipeline","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000246SD205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053013S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359900,"authors":[{"name":"Jaine Blayney","affiliation":["School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"],"firstName":"Jaine","lastName":"Blayney","id":"37640018000"},{"name":"Valeriia Haberland","affiliation":["Tungsten Centre for Intelligent Data Analytics, Goldsmiths, University of London"],"firstName":"Valeriia","lastName":"Haberland","id":"37085623805"},{"name":"Gaye Lightbody","affiliation":["School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"],"firstName":"Gaye","lastName":"Lightbody","id":"37368840500"},{"name":"Fiona Browne","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Ulster University"],"firstName":"Fiona","lastName":"Browne","id":"37870761800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6799-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359900","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biomarker discovery, high performance and cloud computing: A comprehensive review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359900","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Sequential analysis","Robustness","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","cloud computing","grid computing","medical computing","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomarker discovery","high performance computing","cloud computing","biological marker analysis","disease","next generation sequencing technology","cancer research","carcinogenesis","Grid"]}],"abstract":"The analysis of biological markers (biomarkers) have the ability to improve clinical outcomes of a disease through prediction and early detection.

In the past few years, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been widely used to analyze epileptic EEG. However, there are two practical questions unanswered: 1. what the best mother wavelet for epileptic EEG analysis is; 2. what the optimal level of wavelet decomposition is. The main challenge in using wavelet transform is selecting the optimal mother wavelet for the given task, as different mother wavelet applied on the same signal may produces different results. Such a problem also exist in epileptic EEG analysis based on wavelet. Deeper DWT can yield more detailed depiction of signals but it requires substantially more computational time. In this paper, we study these problems, using the most common epileptic EEG classification task, seizure detection, as an example. The results show that all 7 mother wavelets used in this work achieve high seizure detection accuracy at high decomposition levels. Also, decomposition level effects the detection accuracy more significantly than mother wavelets. For all wavelets, decomposition beyond level 7 improves accuracy limitedly and even decreases accuracy. We further study the most effective bands and features for seizure detection. An interpretation to our results is that seizure and non-seizure EEGs differ across all conventional frequency bands of human EEG rhythms. The best accuracy of seizure detection achieved in this research is 92.30% using coif3 from levels 2 to 7.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359914","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG-based seizure detection using discrete wavelet transform through full-level decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EEG-based seizure detection using discrete wavelet transform through full-level decomposition","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359914/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668440","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7359914/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG-based seizure detection using discrete wavelet transform through full-level decomposition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000267B514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111153S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7359928,"authors":[{"name":"Bacem Saada","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Bacem","lastName":"Saada","id":"37085690549"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jing Zhang","id":"37540283000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6799-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6798-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7359928","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Databases","Chlorine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","DNA","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genome compression","RLE technique","hexadecimal representation","extended-ASCII representation","LOSSLESS algorithms","online databases","two bits codation method","DNA sequences compression algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA sequences","Extended-ASCII code","Hexadecimal compression","2-Bits compression method","horizontal compression","vertical compression"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays a large number of DNA sequences is being stored on online databases. To reduce this quantity of information, researchers have been trying to implement new DNA sequences compression techniques based on the LOSSLESS algorithms. In this article we will compare two algorithms using the binary representation of DNA sequences. Those two algorithms are characterized by their ease of implementation. The first one transforms the DNA sequence into extended-ASCII representation while the second algorithm transforms it into a hexadecimal representation. Thereafter, we will apply the RLE technique to further enhance the compression of entire genomes.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359928","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7350074/7359638/07359928.pdf","startPage":"1684","endPage":"1686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7359638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNA sequences compression algorithms based on the two bits codation method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7359928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7359928/","displayDocTitle":"DNA sequences compression algorithms based on the two bits codation method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15668250","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7359928/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNA sequences compression algorithms based on the two bits codation method","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00000281B233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034294S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7350074","isNumber":"7359638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7350074","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7359638","articleId":"7359928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"}]
