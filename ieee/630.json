To efficiently manage SPM, many different data allocation algorithms are proposed. However, most of them cannot achieve optimal results. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic programming approach, Iterational Optimal Data Allocation (IODA) to allocate data for embedded systems with multiple types of memory units. According to the experimental results, the IODA algorithm lowered the energy consumption by 20.14% and 5.11% compared to a random memory allocation and a greedy algorithm, respectively. It also reduced the memory access time by 18.44% and 5.83% compared to a random memory allocation and a greedy algorithm, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300150/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12996973","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6300150/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Data Allocation for Loops on Embedded Systems with Scratch-Pad Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Data Allocation for Loops on Embedded Systems with Scratch-Pad Memory","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108234S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6300150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6300155,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhui Guo","affiliation":["School of Mechanical, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai, P.

The aim is to investigate the performance of the three different parallel power flow solvers. We use four IEEE standard power systems and one actual running power system from Shang dong Province as the test cases when comparing the speedups that a GPU system can provide. The results show that Newton-Raphson solver has the best speedup when it is operated on GPU, Gauss-Seidel solver performs the worst, and P-Q decoupled solver is in the middle. The test results also indicate that when the size of the system is small, GPU does not seem to have advantages over CPU from computation time perspective. However, as the size of the system increases, the advantages of GPU becomes more clear. For instance, when the system has close to one thousand bus counts, the GPU can provide as high as over fifty-three times speedup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","accessionNumber":"12996978","htmlLink":"/document/6300155/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparisons of Parallel Power Flow Solvers on GPU System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparisons of Parallel Power Flow Solvers on GPU System","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070959S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6300155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6300163,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoseung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Hyoseung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38481621900"},{"name":"Ragunathan Rajkumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Ragunathan","lastName":"Rajkumar","id":"37268048500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3017-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4824-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1533-2306"}],"articleNumber":"6300163","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Memory management","Linux","Delay","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Linux","virtual storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared-page management","temporal memory reservation isolation","resource kernels","guaranteed memory access","private pages","shared pages","operating systems","timing delays","shared-page conservation","SPC","shared-page eviction lock","SPEL","inter-process communication","shared libraries","copy-on-write technique","file caches","Linux-RK platform","paged virtual memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-Time Memory Management","Shared Page","Memory Reservation","Temporal Isolation"]}],"abstract":"Memory reservation provides real-time applications with guaranteed memory access to a specified amount of physical memory. However, previous work on memory reservation primarily focused on private pages, and did not pay attention to shared pages, which are widely used in current operating systems. With previous schemes, a real-time application may experience unexpected timing delays from other applications through shared pages that are shared by another process, even though the application has enough free pages in its reservation. In this paper, we describe problems with shared pages in real-time applications, and propose a shared-page management mechanism to enhance the temporal isolation of memory reservations in resource kernels that use resource reservation. The proposed mechanism consists of two techniques, Shared-Page Conservation (SPC) and Shared-Page Eviction Lock (SPEL), each of which prevents timing penalties caused by the seemingly arbitrary eviction of shared pages. The mechanism can manage shared data for inter-process communication and shared libraries, as well as pages shared by the kernel's copy-on-write technique and file caches. We have implemented and evaluated our schemes on the Linux/RK platform, but it can be applied to other operating systems with paged virtual memory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared-Page Management for Improving the Temporal Isolation of Memory Reservations in Resource Kernels","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2012.50","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299185/6300034/06300163.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2012.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Shared-Page Management for Improving the Temporal Isolation of Memory Reservations in Resource Kernels","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6300163/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12996986","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared-Page Management for Improving the Temporal Isolation of Memory Reservations in Resource Kernels","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055529S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6300163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6300164,"authors":[{"name":"Hessam Kooti","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Hessam","lastName":"Kooti","id":"37391933600"},{"name":"Nga Dang","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Nga","lastName":"Dang","id":"37901773400"},{"name":"Deepak Mishra","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37847263800"},{"name":"Eli Bozorgzadeh","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Bozorgzadeh","id":"37278939300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3017-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4824-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1533-2306"}],"articleNumber":"6300164","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Schedules","Batteries","Real time systems","Energy harvesting","Availability","Embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","battery management systems","budgeting","embedded systems","energy harvesting","energy management systems","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy budget management","energy harvesting embedded systems","battery-powered embedded systems","scheduling tasks","quality of service requirements","limited battery charge","energy management technique","online step","offline step","frame-based energy harvesting prediction","QoS level","energy utilization","online scheduler","job scheduling","QoS violation"]}],"abstract":"In battery-powered embedded systems, the limit of battery charge creates a challenge in scheduling tasks to meet both their deadlines and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Harvesting energy from the surrounding environment continuously eliminates the concern of limited battery charge. However, the uncertainty in availability of energy brings challenges in embedded systems. In this paper, we propose an energy management technique to maximize QoS of the system. Our technique is composed of two steps: an offline step and an online step. In the offline step we use frame-based energy harvesting prediction in one harvesting period, in order to find the best QoS level for the tasks and maximize the energy utilization. The information provided from the offline step guides the online scheduler to decide about job scheduling at run-time to minimize the QoS violation. We compared our scheduler with other approaches and on average we reduce the violation count by 22%.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2012.38","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299185/6300034/06300164.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2012.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Budget Management for Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300164/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Budget Management for Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12996987","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6300164/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Budget Management for Energy Harvesting Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070848S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6300164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6300167,"authors":[{"name":"Jiwoong Bang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Dankook University, Yongin, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jiwoong","lastName":"Bang","id":"37086773425"},{"name":"Daewon Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Multimedia Engineering, Dankook University, Cheonan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daewon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086774596"},{"name":"Hyeonsang Eom","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeonsang","lastName":"Eom","id":"37592385300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3017-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4824-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1533-2306"}],"articleNumber":"6300167","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":664},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Frequency division multiplexing","Motion detection","Object detection","Real time systems","Educational institutions","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed circuit television","image sequences","mean square error methods","motion estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion object detection","regional detection method","block-based background difference video frames","smart CCTV","smart closed-circuit television technology","frame difference method","FDM","motionless object detection","adaptive background images","adaptive background subtraction method","ABSM","filmed image","noise variations","light variations","MSE","mean squared error","baseline image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion; Detection; Video Frame; Background Difference; Embedded System Application"]}],"abstract":"Smart CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) technology has increasingly been developed in the last few years to judge the situation and notify the administrator or take immediate action for security and surveillance reasons. Currently the methods to detect object motion typically include the Frame Difference Method (FDM) which can detect moving objects and the Background Subtraction Method (BSM) which is able to detect motionless objects. Those results can be obtained only if there were some background images ready in advance. The Adaptive Background Subtraction Method (ABSM) also could not recognize an object very well if there are rapid scene changes or an object does not move relatively for a long time. To resolve such a problem, in this research, a filmed image has been divided into the regular sized blocks and then, only the necessary parts of the previous frame image are updated in real-time and a background image was generated so that it is insensible to surrounding environment changes such as object motion, noise or light variations. We proposed a novel moving object detection method which showed high performance with regard to the MSE (Mean Squared Error) and the accuracy of detecting the moving object contours compared to other existing methods. We also evaluated quantitatively the detectability for a moving object region by quickly creating a background image even if it is difficult to shoot a background image or we do not have the baseline image prepared in advance. The proposed method could be used for cases that any background image does not exist or hard to be generated. It is also good for observation of many places at the same time with only a single CCTV system since it is especially robust to abrupt scene changes.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2012.58","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299185/6300034/06300167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2012.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300034","startPage":"350","endPage":"357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Object and Regional Detection Method Using Block-Based Background Difference Video Frames","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion Object and Regional Detection Method Using Block-Based Background Difference Video Frames","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300167/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12996990","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6300167/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Object and Regional Detection Method Using Block-Based Background Difference Video Frames","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077703S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6300167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6300234,"authors":[{"name":"Dingcai Shen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dingcai","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086997836"},{"name":"Yuanxiang Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuanxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37292395500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2406-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4789-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6300234","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300234","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new multimodal optimization algorithm, role based particle swarm optimization (RPSO), for finding and maintaining multiple optima in objective function landscape.

reduce the huge amount of raw data. In the conventional hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm, the spatial correlation of the background clutters is often neglected. Moreover, the computational costs render the algorithm ineffective without significant data amount reduction. In this paper, an improved anomaly algorithm is proposed, assuming that the background clutter in the hyperspectral imagery is a three-dimensional Gauss-Markov random field. That is, each interested target may be considered with its contiguous regions during detection. The further anomaly detection algorithm is realized by constructing detection operator based on Gauss-Markov estimation parameters in hyperspectral imagery. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection method based on Gauss-Markov model is more effective than the popular detection algorithm in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2012.21","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299182/6299898/06300299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2012.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6299898","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hyperspectral Imagery Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Gauss-Markov Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hyperspectral Imagery Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Gauss-Markov Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300299/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12997073","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6300299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hyperspectral Imagery Anomaly Detection Algorithm Based on Gauss-Markov Model","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"4789a135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048628S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299182","isNumber":"6299898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299182","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6299898","articleId":"6300299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6300438,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Li","id":"37403411900"},{"name":"Zhiping Xu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Xu","id":"38486244400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2406-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4789-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6300438","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"By combining self-training method of the semi-supervised learning with two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA), a semi-supervised learning based face recognition method is proposed.

Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Improved by Mutative Scale Chaos Algorithm","abstract":"When using the standard particle swarm optimization to optimize the complex problems with high dimension, low convergence efficiency and falling into local optimization usually occur because of its inherent disadvantages. To avoid these disadvantages, a novel hybrid particle swarm optimization improved by mutative scale chaos method is proposed in this paper. This hybrid algorithm combines global high-speed convergence ability of particle swarm optimization with chaos method's advantage, i.e., breaking away from local optimal points easily. The variance of the population's fitness is used to judge premature state of the whole population. The searching space of chaos method can be reduced dynamically by mutative scale scheme, and then searching efficiency of the proposed algorithm is improved further. The test results for benchmark functions show that this novel hybrid algorithm not only surpasses the standard particle swarm optimization obviously in many respects, such as optimization precision, efficiency, success ratio and so on, but also has good stability and low sensitivity to different dimensions of functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12997120","htmlLink":"/document/6300501/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Improved by Mutative Scale Chaos Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Improved by Mutative Scale Chaos Algorithm","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"4789a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073021S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299182","isNumber":"6299898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299182","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6299898","articleId":"6300501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6300519,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wei","affiliation":["School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wei","id":"37399160800"},{"name":"Zhang Qianyuan","affiliation":["School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Qianyuan","id":"38482903000"},{"name":"Yin Xiudi","affiliation":["School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Xiudi","id":"38484740000"},{"name":"Zhu Yayun","affiliation":["School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Yayun","id":"38474699500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2406-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4789-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6300519","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Cloud computing","Government","Security","Computational modeling","Servers","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","government data processing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["index management system","cloud computing","government cloud","government systems","government work efficiency","service quality","data security","data sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","index management system","evaluation model","assessment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300519","abstract":"Cloud computing is an emerging commercial calculation mode.

The algorithm first decomposes a request of VN mapping into meta-requests, each of which is consisted of a pair of nodes and a virtual link. The second step is to search out a path set which meets the aforementioned meta-requests. From such a set, the algorithm selects a path that can achieve a relative balance of the remaining resources. Combining shortest-path algorithm and the depth first search strategy, our algorithm can find out a path that enables the remaining network to maintain a minimum degree of equilibrium. Minimizing the expense of VN construction, our algorithm at the same time pays an attention to the remaining resource balance of the substrate network. Compared with the overall planning based on multi-commodity flow and another approach that simply uses shortest-path algorithm, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the acceptance ratio of virtual network mapping requests.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Virtual Network Decomposing Mapping Algorithm Based on Network Balance","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2012.55","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299182/6299898/06300765.pdf","startPage":"880","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2012.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6299898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6300765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6300765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Study on Virtual Network Decomposing Mapping Algorithm Based on Network Balance","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6300765/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12997258","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Virtual Network Decomposing Mapping Algorithm Based on Network Balance","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"4789a880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038488S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299182","isNumber":"6299898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299182","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6299898","articleId":"6300765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6300801,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqi Ma","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaoqi","lastName":"Ma","id":"37537761100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2406-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4789-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6300801","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Availability","Servers","Cryptography","Computational modeling","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security concerns","cloud computing","computing resources","security challenges"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","security"]}],"abstract":"In cloud computing environment, security becomes a more and more critical issue as users are sharing computing resources remotely.

The angular distance of characteristic triangle is employed for coarse classification to active the subnets for star pattern recognition. Then the star pattern obtained by the grid method for the main star is sent to the corresponding subnets for the star pattern identification. At last, the identification results of the active subnets are validated to obtain the only recognition result.

Hybrid timed automaton models of the supervised production plant are generated and executed in parallel to the system by using data samples as model input. According to comparisons of predicted energy consumption with the production plant observations, anomalies can be detected automatically. An evaluation within a small factory shows that anomalies of 10 % differences in energy consumption, wrong control sequences and wrong timings can be detected with a minimum accuracy of 98 %. With this approach, downtimes of production systems can be shortened and atypical energy consumptions can be detected and adjusted to optimal operation.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2012.6301142","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th International Conference on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294017/6300337/06301142.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2012.6301142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting anomalous energy consumptions in distributed manufacturing systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301142/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting anomalous energy consumptions in distributed manufacturing systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12997461","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301142/","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting anomalous energy consumptions in distributed manufacturing systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"CD003123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066284S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294017","isNumber":"6300337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294017","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6300337","articleId":"6301142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6301218,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37896335300"},{"name":"Shaoping Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Science and Technology on Aircraft Control Laboratory, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaoping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406367100"},{"name":"Jian Shi","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Shi","id":"38487906200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0311-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0310-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"6301218","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated reliability theory and evaluation methodology of AFDX","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Engines","Reliability theory","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","avionics","control engineering computing","delays","fault tolerance","local area networks","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","Petri nets","queueing theory","reliability","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated reliability theory","AFDX","fault-tolerant operation mechanism","failure mechanism","avionics full duplex switched Ethernet","airborne systems","full duplex communication","dynamic adjustment strategy","service performance","fault tolerant degradation","stochastic Petri network","traffic variance","optimal threshold traffic model","optimization threshold","particle swarm algorithm","control theory","nonlinear robust resources controller","buffer size","time delay","G/M/1 queuing model","airborne network","commercial airplane","service-oriented integrated reliability model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AFDX","network traffic","time delay","traffic shaping","integrated reliability"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the fault-tolerant operation mechanism and failure mechanism of Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX).

We consider the unknown aerodynamic forces and moments which will degrade the brake performance significantly.

By integrating a neural network (NN) estimator to approximate unknown aerodynamic forces and moments, the proposed control can effectively suppress the aerodynamic uncertainties and weight variation. The brake torque input constraint is also discussed in this paper. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2012.6301235","startPage":"740","endPage":"745","publicationTitle":"IEEE 10th International Conference on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2012.6301235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 10th International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294017/6300337/06301235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive neural network control of aircraft braking system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301235/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive neural network control of aircraft braking system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301235/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12997554","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive neural network control of aircraft braking system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"CD005967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073795S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294017","isNumber":"6300337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294017","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6300337","articleId":"6301235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6301243,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Lei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Lei","id":"38271971900"},{"name":"Shi Yikai","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Yikai","id":"38485454300"},{"name":"Yuan Xiaoqing","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xiaoqing","id":"38479715300"},{"name":"Danwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Danwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547600"},{"name":"Yu Ming","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Ming","id":"38485211800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0311-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0312-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0310-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"6301243","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Neural networks","Training","Parameter estimation","Equations","Vehicles","Steering systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","backpropagation","identification","least squares approximations","neural nets","steering systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight-varying neural network","parameter identification","automatic vehicle","bond graph model","steering system","model equations","uncertain parameters","integrative approach","least square method","bp neural network algorithm","training method","BPNN","initial weight value","network training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Vehicle","Bond Graph","Neural Network","Parameter Identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301243","abstract":"A Bond Graph model is built for the steering system of automatic vehicle and a set of model equations are derived for further analysis purpose.

Currently, there are several approaches provided to leverage the features of PCM to improve the performance of system. However, as PCM is not available in the market, current researches could only use DRAM to simulate PCM. What is more, there are no researches to simulate the full features of PCM. In this paper, we design and implement SIMPCM, a device-level PCM simulator. SIM-PCM is the first PCM Simulator that supports PCM features including latency and non-volatility.

They provide significant performance gains over multi-core CPU systems, and are an easily accessible alternative to supercomputers. The architecture of general purpose GPU systems(GPGPU), however, poses challenges in efficiently transferring data among the host and device(s). Although commodity many core devices such as NVIDIA GPUs provide more than one way to move data around, it is unclear which method is most effective given a particular application. This presents difficulty in supporting latency-sensitive cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this work we present a new approach to data transfer in a heterogeneous computing system that allows direct communication between GPUs and other I/O devices. In addition to adding this functionality our system also improves communication between the GPU and host. We analyze the current vendor provided data communication mechanisms and identify which methods work best for particular tasks with respect to throughput, and total time to completion. Our method allows a new class of real-time cyber-physical applications to be implemented on a GPGPU system. The results of the experiments presented here show that GPU tasks can be completed in 34 percent less time than current methods. Furthermore, effective data throughput is at least as good as the current best performers.

Compared with DRAM, PRAM draws a lot of attention recently, since it provides higher density and has no need to refresh the capacitor charge periodically. The non-volatile nature of PRAM can even reduce compulsory miss, which cannot be avoided by DRAM cache. However, PRAM cache cannot replace DRAM cache due to its endurance issue. Thus DRAM/PRAM hybrid cache becomes a good alternative for traditional DRAM cache. Least recently used (LRU) replacement algorithm and CLOCK-Pro algorithm work well for traditional DRAM cache. But these algorithms shall not be directly applied to DRAM/PRAM hybrid cache since the characteristics of PRAM are not considered. This paper proposed a double circular caching scheme to manage DRAM/PRAM hybrid cache. In our scheme, cached data migrate between DRAM cache and PRAM cache adaptively to achieve good hit ratio while frequent writes to PRAM cache are avoided for endurance concern.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2012.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2012.23","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299185/6300034/06301469.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double Circular Caching Scheme for DRAM/PRAM Hybrid Cache","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Double Circular Caching Scheme for DRAM/PRAM Hybrid Cache","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301469/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12997011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301469/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double Circular Caching Scheme for DRAM/PRAM Hybrid Cache","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04999S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6301469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6301555,"authors":[{"name":"Shivashis Saha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Shivashis","lastName":"Saha","id":"37400544200"},{"name":"Ying Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Lu","id":"37292930600"},{"name":"Jitender S.

This increase in power-density results in high heat density and may affect the reliability and performance of real-time systems. Thus, incorporating maximum temperature constraints in scheduling of real-time task sets is an important challenge. This paper investigates thermal-constrained energy-aware partitioning of periodic real-time tasks in heterogeneous multi-core multiprocessor systems. We adopt a power model which considers the impact of temperature and voltage on a processor's static power consumption. Two types of thermal models are used to respectively capture negligible and non-negligible amount of heat transfer among cores. We develop a novel genetic-algorithm based approach to solve the heterogeneous multi-core multiprocessor partitioning problem. Extensive simulations were performed to validate the effectiveness of the approach. Experimental results show that integrating a worst-fit based partitioning heuristic with the genetic algorithm can significantly reduce the total energy consumption of a heterogeneous multi-core multiprocessor real-time system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-Constrained Energy-Aware Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-core Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2012.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6299185/6300034/06301555.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2012.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-Constrained Energy-Aware Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-core Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301555/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12997020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-Constrained Energy-Aware Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-core Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4824a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073971S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6299185","isNumber":"6300034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6299185","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6300034","articleId":"6301555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6301666,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics and the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lei Lei received the B.Eng. degree in electronics information engineering from Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, China, in 2009.

Maxterms can be easily obtained based on minterms. The reconfigurability and scalability of the system are largely enhanced compared to our previous work. Correct and clear temporal waveforms are achieved for all the canonical logic units. The measured extinction ratios of two-input and three-input CLUs are ~ 15 dB and ~ 11 dB, respectively. Based on the CLUs, both sum-of-products and product-of-sums typed PLAs are exhibited. Six important logic functions, including full-adder, full-subtractor, multiplier, multiplexer, demultiplexer and decoder, are presented as examples to show that the canonical logic units-based programmable logic array (CLUs-PLA) can be reconfigured to perform different logic functions. The features of simple architectures, integration ability of SOA and programmable filter enable the great integration potential for CLUs-PLA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Logic functions","Programmable logic arrays","Optical interferometry","Arrays","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demultiplexing equipment","nonlinear optics","optical filters","optical logic","programmable logic arrays","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all optical canonical logic units","programmable logic array","CLU-PLA","semiconductor optical amplifiers","cross-gain modulation","temporal waveforms","extinction ratio","sum-of-products","product-of-sums","full-adder","full-subtractor","multiplier","demultiplexer","decoder","programmable filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear optics","optical computing","optical logic devices","optical signal processing","programmable logic array","semiconductor optical amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2218575","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6334500/06301666.pdf","startPage":"3532","endPage":"3539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6334500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2218575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Canonical Logic Units-Based Programmable Logic Array (CLUs-PLA) Using Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Canonical Logic Units-Based Programmable Logic Array (CLUs-PLA) Using Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301666/","volume":"30","issue":"22","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301666/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13143950","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Canonical Logic Units-Based Programmable Logic Array (CLUs-PLA) Using Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2218575-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063886S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6334500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6334500","articleId":"6301666","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6301671,"authors":[{"name":"Yeong-Chau Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503869/6387608/6301671/6301671-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yeong-Chau Kuo (M\u201909) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1990 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2001.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

The strain sensors are mounted at the base of the building to measure the settlement and plastic hinge activation of the building after an earthquake. They measure periodically or on-demand from the base station. The accelerometers are mounted at every floor of the building to measure the seismic response of the building during an earthquake. They record during an earthquake event using a combination of the local acceleration data and remote triggering from the base station based on the acceleration data from multiple sensors across the building. A low power network architecture was implemented over an 802.15.4 MAC in the 900-MHz band. A custom patch antenna was designed in this frequency band to obtain robust links in real-world conditions. The modules have been validated in a full-scale laboratory setup with simulated earthquakes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2218680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423230","startPage":"909","endPage":"915","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6423230/06301674.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power Wireless Sensor Network for Building Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6301674/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low Power Wireless Sensor Network for Building Monitoring","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13287756","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Wireless Sensor Network for Building Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jsen-torfs-2218680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070157S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6423230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6423230","articleId":"6301674","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6301679,"authors":[{"name":"Mehryar Rahmatian","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehryar","lastName":"Rahmatian","id":"38235091700"},{"name":"Hessam Kooti","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hessam","lastName":"Kooti","id":"37391933600"},{"name":"Ian G.

To understand how different genes interact to create different proteins, we need to model the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of different organisms. There are different models that attempt to model GRNs. In this paper, we use the popular S-System to model small networks. This model has been solved with different evolutionary computation techniques, which have obtained good results; yet, there are no models that achieve a perfect reconstruction of the network. We implement a variation of particle swarm optimization (PSO), called dissipative PSO (DPSO), to optimize the model; we also research the use of an L1 regularizer and compare it with other evolutionary computing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, neither the DPSO nor L1 optimizer has been jointly used to solve the S-System. We find that the combination of S-System and DPSO offers advantages over previously used methods, and presents promising results for inferencing larger and more complex networks.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6570514/06301687.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse Engineering of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Dissipative Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2012.2218610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6570514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2012.2218610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reverse Engineering of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Dissipative Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13692776","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6301687/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse Engineering of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Dissipative Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-palafox-2218610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108374S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6570514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6570514","articleId":"6301687","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6301692,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Busquets-Monge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6423965/6301692/6301692-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sergio Busquets-Monge (S'99\u2013M'06\u2013SM'11) was born in Barcelona, Spain.

The output voltage is doubled by using an H-bridge configuration, and only a single-secondary grid coupling transformer is required. In addition, the intermediate magnetic elements ensure an equal power sharing between the four inverters. Since they also allow for the harmonic cancellation between the inverter poles and eliminate any third harmonic component created by the modulation, the output voltage waveform has a high quality, often eliminating the need for additional filtering.

The \u03b1'\u03b2' frame is a coordinate system similar to the \u03b1\u03b2 frame. In this frame, some original complex calculations are substituted by integer additions, integer subtractions, truncations, etc. It brings the time and area efficiency to fixed-point digital realization, particularly for the application in a field-programmable gate array. Meanwhile, a minimum energy property of multiple dc-link capacitors is applied as the basic principle for voltage equalization based on a capacitor current prediction algorithm. By evaluating the redundant vectors in each pulse dwelling period, the balancing algorithm chooses an optimal vector, generates the optimal PWM signals, and sustains the voltage stability. After that, an arbitrary multilevel SVPWM intellectual property core is designed and analyzed in the \u03b1'\u03b2' frame. At the end of this paper, a five-level DCMC-based static synchronous compensator is built and tested. The experimental results verify the balancing algorithm and the system steady-state and dynamic performances.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2218553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2218553","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6423965/06301699.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel SVPWM With DC-Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control for Diode-Clamped Multilevel Converter Based STATCOM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel SVPWM With DC-Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control for Diode-Clamped Multilevel Converter Based STATCOM","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2013","volume":"60","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301699/","accessionNumber":"13287660","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301699/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel SVPWM With DC-Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control for Diode-Clamped Multilevel Converter Based STATCOM","sourcePdf":"tie-shu-2218553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099471S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6423965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6423965","articleId":"6301699","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6301701,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Yoshida","affiliation":["Department of Information and System Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6301701/6301701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Koichi Yoshida received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, in 1987, 1989, and 1995, respectively.","In 1989, he joined Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Tsukuba, Japan, where he engaged in the research and development of maintenance automation robotics for optical fiber networks.

It operates as if the two optical fibers were seamlessly connected without the need for any photoelectric devices. Collimator focusing, as well as axis alignment, is critical for low-loss transmission. A simultaneous optimization requires a task of six degrees of freedom (DOFs) in total. The assisted focus adjustment proposed here is performed for an FSO system to match a specified link span using an optomechatronic system in advance of its installation. Thus, the six-DOF task is mitigated, leaving an axis alignment task only. Then, the tuned FSO system can be combined with an existent misalignment compensation mechanism for beam acquisition/tracking at the installation site if necessary.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2218554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06301701.pdf","startPage":"5306","endPage":"5314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2218554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assisted Focus Adjustment for Free Space Optics System Coupling Single-Mode Optical Fibers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301701/","displayDocTitle":"Assisted Focus Adjustment for Free Space Optics System Coupling Single-Mode Optical Fibers","volume":"60","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13563541","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6301701/","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assisted Focus Adjustment for Free Space Optics System Coupling Single-Mode Optical Fibers","sourcePdf":"tie-yoshida-2218554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047185S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6301701","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6301704,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Christlein","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition Laboratory, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6342844/6301704/6301704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Christlein (S'10) received the Diploma degree in computer science in 2012 from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.

In recent years, the detection of copy-move forgeries has become one of the most actively researched topics in blind image forensics. A considerable number of different algorithms have been proposed focusing on different types of postprocessed copies. In this paper, we aim to answer which copy-move forgery detection algorithms and processing steps (e.g., matching, filtering, outlier detection, affine transformation estimation) perform best in various postprocessing scenarios. The focus of our analysis is to evaluate the performance of previously proposed feature sets. We achieve this by casting existing algorithms in a common pipeline. In this paper, we examined the 15 most prominent feature sets. We analyzed the detection performance on a per-image basis and on a per-pixel basis. We created a challenging real-world copy-move dataset, and a software framework for systematic image manipulation. Experiments show, that the keypoint-based features Sift and Surf, as well as the block-based DCT, DWT, KPCA, PCA, and Zernike features perform very well. These feature sets exhibit the best robustness against various noise sources and downsampling, while reliably identifying the copied regions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146169","htmlLink":"/document/6301704/","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of Popular Copy-Move Forgery Detection Approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of Popular Copy-Move Forgery Detection Approaches","sourcePdf":"tifs-riess-2218597-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12879S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"423","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6301704","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":6301722,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chao-Kai Wen (S'00\u2013M'04) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2004.

Our channel model reflects the characteristics in small-cell networks where antenna correlations, line-of-sight components, and general type of fading distributions have to be included. The mutual information expression can be expressed as functionals of the Stieltjes transform through the so-called Shannon transform. Ideally, if the Stieltjes transform is known in the context of the large-dimensional RMT, then the problem is solved. However, it is difficult to derive the Stieltjes transform of the considered channel models directly, especially when the transmit correlation matrices are generally nonnegative definite and the channel entries are non-Gaussian. To overcome this, we use the generalized Lindeberg principle to show that the Stieltjes transforms of this class of random matrices with Gaussian or non-Gaussian independent entries coincide in the large-dimensional regime. This result permits to derive the deterministic equivalents (e.g., the Stieltjes transform and the ergodic mutual information) for non-Gaussian MIMO channels from the known results developed for Gaussian MIMO channels. As an application, we determine the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for the MIMO-MACs and prove that the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices are asymptotically independent of the fading distribution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deterministic Equivalent for the Analysis of Non-Gaussian Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2218571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6387658/06301722.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2218571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387658","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Deterministic Equivalent for the Analysis of Non-Gaussian Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6301722/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187836","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deterministic Equivalent for the Analysis of Non-Gaussian Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-chen-2218571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143909S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6387658","articleId":"6301722","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6301743,"authors":[{"name":"Chengkun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Chengkun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533378200"},{"name":"Jaume Franch","affiliation":["TheDepartment of Applied Mathematics, University Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jaume","lastName":"Franch","id":"37273321400"},{"name":"Sunil K.

A common premise of previous research is that the QoS values of services to target users are supposed to be all known. However, many of QoS values are unknown in reality. This paper presents a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering approach to predict such unknown values for QoS-based selection. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has three new features: 1) the adjusted-cosine-based similarity calculation to remove the impact of different QoS scale; 2) a data smoothing process to improve prediction accuracy; and 3) a similarity fusion approach to handle the data sparsity problem. In addition, a two-phase neighbor selection strategy is proposed to improve its scalability. An extensive performance study based on a public data set demonstrates its effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301755/","volume":"43","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6301755/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13307220","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Quality of Service for Selection by Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Quality of Service for Selection by Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering","sourcePdf":"tsmc-chen-2210409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123916S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6461142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6461142","articleId":"6301755","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6301756,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

The state-parameter estimate is computed using a particle filter and is represented as a probability distribution, allowing the prediction of end of life and remaining useful life within a probabilistic framework that supports uncertainty management. We also develop a novel variance control algorithm that maintains an uncertainty bound around the unknown parameters to limit the amount of estimation uncertainty and, consequently, reduce prediction uncertainty.

This paper presents new experimental results with an intrinsically compliant robotic gait training orthosis and a trajectory tracking controller. The intrinsically compliant robotic orthosis has six degrees of freedom. Sagittal plane hip and knee joints were powered by the actuation of pneumatic muscle actuators in opposing pair configuration. The orthosis has passive hip abduction/adduction joint and passive mechanisms to allow vertical and lateral translations of the trunk. A passive foot lifter having a spring mechanism was used to ensure sufficient dorsiflexion during swing phase. A trajectory tracking controller based on a chattering-free robust variable structure control law was implemented in joint space to guide the subject's limbs on physiological gait trajectories. The performance of the robotic orthosis was evaluated during two gait training modes, namely, \u201ctrajectory tracking mode with maximum compliance\u201d and \u201ctrajectory tracking mode with minimum compliance.\u201d The experimental evaluations were carried out with ten neurologically intact subjects. The results show that the robotic orthosis is able to perform the gait training task during the two gait training modes. All the subjects tend to deviate from the reference joint angle trajectories with an increase in robotic compliance as the subjects have more freedom to voluntarily drive the robotic orthosis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Nonlinear Control of an Intrinsically Compliant Robotic Gait Training Orthosis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2207111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221021/6497536/06301762.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2207111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust Nonlinear Control of an Intrinsically Compliant Robotic Gait Training Orthosis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6301762/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13431039","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Nonlinear Control of an Intrinsically Compliant Robotic Gait Training Orthosis","sourcePdf":"tsmc-hussain-2207111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105304S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6497536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6497536","articleId":"6301762","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6301763,"authors":[{"name":"Sumin Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sumin","lastName":"Cho","id":"38241069500"},{"name":"Sungho Jo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Jo","id":"37586566700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2216"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2232"}],"articleNumber":"6301763","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":581},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Education","Robots","Trajectory","Joints","Vectors","Humans","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","humanoid robots","human-robot interaction","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental online learning","robot behaviors","selected multiple kinesthetic teaching trials","adequate teaching trials","Gaussian mixture model","GMM","human-robot interaction","humanoid robot","learning performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian mixture model","incremental learning","learning by imitation","learning from demonstrations","robots"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2207108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2207108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221021/6497536/06301763.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Online Learning of Robot Behaviors From Selected Multiple Kinesthetic Teaching Trials","abstract":"This paper presents a new approach to the incremental online learning of behaviors by a robot from multiple kinesthetic teaching trials. The approach enables a robot to refine and reproduce a specific behavior every time a new teaching trial is provided and to decide autonomously whether to accept or reject each trial. The robot neglects bad teaching trials and learns a behavior based on adequate teaching trials. The framework of this approach consists of the projection of motion data to a latent space and the description of motion data in a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). To realize the incremental online learning, the latent space and the GMM are refined incrementally after each proper teaching trial. The trial data are discarded after being used. The number of Gaussian components in the GMM is not initially fixed but is autonomously selected by the robot over the trials. The proposed method is more suitable for practical human-robot interaction. The experiments with a humanoid robot show the feasibility of the approach. We demonstrate that the robot can incrementally refine and reproduce learned behaviors that accurately represent the essential characteristics of the teaching trials through our learning algorithm and that it can reject erroneous teaching trials to improve learning performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13431040","htmlLink":"/document/6301763/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incremental Online Learning of Robot Behaviors From Selected Multiple Kinesthetic Teaching Trials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Online Learning of Robot Behaviors From Selected Multiple Kinesthetic Teaching Trials","sourcePdf":"tsmc-jo-2207108-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062313S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6497536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6497536","articleId":"6301763","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6301780,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Hsin Chen","affiliation":["MediaTek, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6339059/6301780/6301780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuo-Hsin Chen was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1976.

The proposed design employs the on-chip battery voltage tracking common-mode reference (BAVTCMR) generator and the pseudo-differential topology to achieve the high SNR requirement in a hands-free/receiver 2-in-1 loudspeaker. This amplifier can achieve 106 dB/100 dB PSRR at 217 Hz and 1 kHz, respectively. In receiver mode, this design can drive 46 mW into an 8- \u03a9 load. A true 100-dB SNR is also achieved when a global system for mobile communications (GSM) is generating ripple noise on the system power lines. Reconfiguration is implemented by employing the low-noise operational amplifier (opamp) and capacitors in the class-D integrator as the first gain stage and the compensation capacitors, respectively, in a class-AB amplifier. Hence, the hardware redundancy and the design complexity are both minimized. Fabricated with 0.153-\u03bcm CMOS technology, 74-dB/76-dB THD are achieved for class-AB and class-D, respectively. More than 90% efficiency is achieved in class-D mode operation. The maximum output power at 1% THD is 1.23 W.

Energy consumption plays a more and more important role in the manufacturing environment. This is mainly driven by energy cost and environmental concerns. When the energy system becomes complicated and coupled with ongoing production, it is very difficult to hunt the \u201chidden treasure\u201d which affects the overall benefit of a manufacturing system. This paper provides a systematic method to search for energy saving opportunities and strategies. We start from dynamic production transient analysis and provide quantitative analysis for identifying energy saving opportunity in a system. Furthermore, energy saving strategy is justified through cost analysis for tradeoffs between energy savings and throughput loss. A case study is conducted to demonstrate its potential on energy savings in a multistage manufacturing system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2012.2210874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6493467/06301788.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"342","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2012.2210874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Saving Opportunity Analysis of Automotive Serial Production Systems (March 2012)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy Saving Opportunity Analysis of Automotive Serial Production Systems (March 2012)","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6301788/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413121","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Saving Opportunity Analysis of Automotive Serial Production Systems (March 2012)","sourcePdf":"tase-chang-2210874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164228S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6493467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6493467","articleId":"6301788","onlineDate":"12 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6301796,"authors":[{"name":"Taher Niknam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6301804/6301796/6301796-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taher Niknam was born in Shiraz, Iran.

The multiple objectives of the VVC problem to be minimized are the electrical energy losses, voltage deviations, total electrical energy costs, and total emissions of renewable energy sources and grid. For this purpose, the uncertainty related to hourly load, wind power, and solar irradiance forecasts are modeled in a scenario-based stochastic framework. A roulette wheel mechanism based on the probability distribution functions of these random variables is considered to generate the scenarios. Consequently, the stochastic multiobjective VVC (SMVVC) problem is converted to a series of equivalent deterministic scenarios. Furthermore, an Evolutionary Algorithm using the Modified Teaching-Learning-Algorithm (MTLA) is proposed to solve the SMVVC in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. In the proposed algorithm, a new mutation method is taken into account in order to enhance the global searching ability and mitigate the premature convergence to local minima. Finally, two distribution test feeders are considered as case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SMVVC.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6301804/06301796.pdf","startPage":"2004","endPage":"2019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2209900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2209900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6301796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scenario-Based Multiobjective Volt/Var Control in Distribution Networks Including Renewable Energy Sources","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Stochastic processes","Uncertainty","Load modeling","Linear programming","Vectors","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","evolutionary computation","fuel cell power plants","hydroelectric power stations","integer programming","nonlinear programming","photovoltaic power systems","power distribution control","power generation control","probability","reactive power control","search problems","voltage control","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scenario based multiobjective voltage control","VAR control","distribution networks","renewable energy source","hydroturbine","fuel cell","wind turbine","photovoltaic power plant","electrical energy losses","voltage deviation","electrical energy costs","roulette wheel mechanism","probability distribution functions","evolutionary algorithm","modified teaching-learning algorithm","mixed integer nonlinear programming problem","mutation method","global searching ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Daily volt/var control","multiobjective optimization","renewable energy sources","stochastic optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6301796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Scenario-Based Multiobjective Volt/Var Control in Distribution Networks Including Renewable Energy Sources","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6301796/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12999154","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scenario-Based Multiobjective Volt/Var Control in Distribution Networks Including Renewable Energy Sources","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-niknam-2209900-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113309S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6301804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6301804","articleId":"6301796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6301800,"authors":[{"name":"Tine L.

For the islanded operation of the microgrid, several control strategies for the primary control have been developed to ensure stable microgrid operation. In low-voltage (LV) microgrids, active power/voltage (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n) droop controllers are gaining attention as they take the resistive nature of the network lines and the lack of directly coupled rotating inertia into account. However, a problem often cited with these droop controllers is that the grid voltage is not a global parameter. This can influence the power sharing between different units. In this paper, it is investigated whether this is actually a disadvantage of the control strategy. It is shown that with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n droop control, the DG units that are located electrically far from the load centers automatically deliver a lower share of the power.

The main objective of this paper is to minimize transient response specifications chosen as rise time, settling time and overshoot, for better speed response of DC motor drive. The speed control of DC motor is done using PI and PID controllers. Implementation of PID controller for DC motor speed control is done using ZN and MZN tuning method. For PSO algorithm technique, PI controller is used to improve the performance of DC motor speed control system. A comparison is made on the basis of objective function (rise time, settling time and overshoot) from output Step responses. The proposed approach had superior features, including easy implementation, stable convergence characteristic, and good computational efficiency. Fast tuning of optimum PI controller parameters yields high-quality solution. Compared with traditional ZN method and MZN method, the proposed method is found indeed more efficient and robust in improving the step response of DC motor drive system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302000/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12997604","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6302000/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2012","conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal tuning of PI controller for speed control of DC motor drive using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal tuning of PI controller for speed control of DC motor drive using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Mylavaram, India","sourcePdf":"P1001828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087817S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294018","isNumber":"6301985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294018","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6301985","articleId":"6302000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6302002,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The space vector diagram of three-level inverter is simplified into two-level inverter. So the selection of switching sequences is done as conventional two-level SVPWM method. Where in conventional direct torque control (CDTC), the stator flux and torque are directly controlled by the selection of optimal switching modes. The selection is made to restrict the flux and torque errors in corresponding hysteresis bands. In spite of its fast torque response, it has more flux, torque and current ripples in steady state. To overcome the ripples in steady state, a space vector based pulse width modulation (SVPWM) methodology is proposed in this paper. The proposed SVPWM method reduces the computational burden and reduces the total harmonic distortion compared with 2-level one and the conventional one also.

Power quality is quantified via Power Quality Indices (PQIs). High power quality (PQ) level represents one of the main objectives towards Power system. The currently used Power Quality Indices (PQIs) that are a measure of the PQ level are defined based on the Fourier Transform that produces unrealistic results in case of nonstationary PQ disturbances. The paper presents reformulated version of present PQIs based on Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). The paper also explores the WPT capabilities in accurately analyzing non-stationary waveforms and providing a uniform frequency sub-bands leading to identifying more frequency components especially at high frequency.

Specifically, linear transmit and receive filter sets are designed which maximize the weighted sum rate while allowing each transmitter to utilize only the local channel state information. Our approach is based on extending the existing method of minimizing the weighted mean squared error (MSE) for the MIMO broadcast channel to the K-user interference channel at hand. For the case of the individual transmitter power constraint, however, a straightforward generalization of the existing method does not reveal a viable solution. It is in fact shown that there exists no closed-form solution for the transmit filter but simple one-dimensional parameter search yields the desired solution. Compared to the direct filter optimization using gradient-based search, our solution requires considerably less computational complexity and a smaller amount of feedback resources while achieving essentially the same level of weighted sum rate. A modified filter design is also presented which provides desired robustness in the presence of channel uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091012.110110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6331703/06302110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091012.110110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331703","startPage":"2776","endPage":"2783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted-Sum-Rate-Maximizing Linear Transceiver Filters for the K-User MIMO Interference Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weighted-Sum-Rate-Maximizing Linear Transceiver Filters for the K-User MIMO Interference Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13056956","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6302110/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted-Sum-Rate-Maximizing Linear Transceiver Filters for the K-User MIMO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"2776-tc1210-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069748S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6331703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6331703","articleId":"6302110","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6302111,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Xiao","affiliation":["Communication Theory School of Electrical Engineering and the ACCESS Linnaeus Center, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6302111/6302111-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Xiao (S'02-M'07) was born in SiChuan Province, P.

In these networks, M users have independent information to be transmitted to a common base station (BS) with the help of N relays, where M \u2265 2 and N \u2265 1 are arbitrary integers. We investigate such networks in terms of diversity order to measure asymptotic performance. For networks with orthogonal channels, we show that network codes based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can achieve the maximum diversity order of N+1. We further show that the MDS coding construction of network codes is also necessary to obtain full diversity for linear finite field network coding (FFNC). Then, we compare the performance of the FFNC approach with superposition coding (SC) at the relays. The results show that the FFNC based on MDS codes has better performance than SC in both the high rate and the high SNR regime. Further, we discuss networks without direct source-to-BS channels for N \u2265 M. We show that the proposed FFNC can obtain the diversity order N-M+1, which is equivalent to achieving the Singleton bound for network error-correction codes. Finally, we study the network with nonorthogonal channels and show our codes can still achieve a diversity order of N+1, which cannot be achieved by a scheme based on SC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","volume":"60","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13188478","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6302111/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Network Codes for Multiple-User Multiple-Relay Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Network Codes for Multiple-User Multiple-Relay Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"3755-tc1212-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121727S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6302111","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6302112,"authors":[{"name":"Won-Yong Shin","affiliation":["Division of Mobile Systems Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Yong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37535066000"},{"name":"Dohyung Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dohyung","lastName":"Park","id":"37401348900"},{"name":"Bang Chul Jung","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Tongyeong, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Bang Chul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289794700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6302112","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Diversity methods","Throughput","Fading","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink multicell networks","distributed opportunistic scheduling strategy","DOS strategy","predetermined thresholds","uplink K-cell networks","time-invariant channel coefficients","base station","mobile station","channel link","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","multiuser diversity gain","degrees-of-freedom gain","multicell environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless scheduling","inter-cell interference","cellular uplink","degrees-of-freedom","multi-user diversity"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) strategy, based on two pre-determined thresholds, for uplink K-cell networks with time-invariant channel coefficients.

Some of its advantages include high data rates, ease of deployment, license-free operation, and high security. However, the weather-dependent optical wireless channel introduces attenuation and intensity variations known as scintillation which impose severe challenges for reliable data transmission. The distance dependence of both attenuation and scintillation motivates the use of relays as a means of improving the system performance and extending the range of communication. In this paper, we advocate the use of all-optical relays equipped with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which, in contrast to conventional FSO relays with electrical amplification, avoid optical-to-electrical and electrical-to-optical conversions. We develop accurate signal and noise models for fixed and variable gain all-optical and electrical relaying which include the effects of all relevant system parameters and types of noise. For performance evaluation, we analyze the outage probability of all-optical relaying in lognormal fading for dual-hop and multi-hop transmission. Our results show that all-optical relays, while simpler from an implementation point of view, outperform electrical relays unless the number of relays is very large.

At first, based on the symmetric cut-off rate of the N-D signal space, we develop a design criterion with regard to the precoder G. It is then demonstrated that the use of rotated constellations in only a reasonably low dimensional signal space can significantly increase the mutual information in high-rate regimes. Based on parameterizations of unitary matrices, we then construct good unitary precoder G in 4-D signal space using a simple optimization problem, which involves only four real variables and it is applicable to any modulation scheme. To further illustrate the potential of multi-D constellation and to show the practical use of mutual information improvement, we propose a simple yet powerful bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) scheme in which a (multi-D) mapping technique employed in a multi-D rotated constellation is concatenated with a short-memory high-rate convolutional code. By using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, it is shown that the proposed technique provides an exceptionally good error performance. In particular, both EXIT chart analysis and simulation results indicate that a turbo pinch-off and a bit error rate around 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n happen at a signal-to-noise ratio that is well below the coded modulation and BICM capacities using traditional signal sets. For example, with code rates ranging from 2/3 to 7/8, the proposed system can operate 0.82 dB-2.93 dB lower than the BICM capacity with QPSK and Gray labeling. The mutual information gain offered by rotated constellations can be therefore utilized to design simple yet near Shannon limit systems in the high-rate regions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotated Multi-D Constellations in Rayleigh Fading: Mutual Information Improvement and Pragmatic Approach for Near-Capacity Performance in High-Rate Regions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091012.110253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06302114.pdf","startPage":"3694","endPage":"3704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091012.110253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Rotated Multi-D Constellations in Rayleigh Fading: Mutual Information Improvement and Pragmatic Approach for Near-Capacity Performance in High-Rate Regions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6302114/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188481","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotated Multi-D Constellations in Rayleigh Fading: Mutual Information Improvement and Pragmatic Approach for Near-Capacity Performance in High-Rate Regions","sourcePdf":"3694-tc1212-herath.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095874S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6302114","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6302115,"authors":[{"name":"Daewon Jung","affiliation":["R&D Strategy Department, The Attached Institute of ETRI, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6302115/6302115-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daewon Jung received his B.S. degree in Electronics and Communications engineering from Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Korea in 2006, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Information and Communications from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Korea, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an asynchronous medium access control (MAC) protocol, which enables senders to independently start their transmissions if the access point (AP) can receive more simultaneous packets up to its multi-packet reception capability. This asynchronous protocol makes the multi-user MIMO channel more efficiently used, especially in wireless networks where transmission durations are dynamically varying due to different packet sizes and transmission rates. Through our performance analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the proposed asynchronous MAC protocol achieves significantly higher uplink throughput performance in multi-user MIMO wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.090512.110300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06302115.pdf","startPage":"3745","endPage":"3754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.090512.110300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Medium Access Protocol for Multi-User MIMO Based Uplink WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302115/","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Medium Access Protocol for Multi-User MIMO Based Uplink WLANs","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188482","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6302115/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Medium Access Protocol for Multi-User MIMO Based Uplink WLANs","sourcePdf":"3745-tc1212-jung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078849S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6302115","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6302116,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Karimi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, \u00d6zye\u011fin University, Istanbul, Turkey","Department of Combinatorics and Optimization, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6389884/6302116/6302116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Karimi was born in 1982.

However, for the case that both the source-relay and relay-destination links experience the keyhole effect, i.e., double keyhole effect (DKE), the achievable diversity order is only one regardless of the number of antennas. In contrast, utilizing the squaring approach, the overall diversity gain can be achieved as min(n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n, n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</sub>\n) for both SKE and DKE.

It is generally thought that absorbing sets, i.e., small collections of variable nodes connected to a relatively small number of unsatisfied check nodes, are the primary source of errors in the error floor region. The conditional upper bounds presented here are based on the assumption that all error floor errors are caused by absorbing sets. In order to bound the probability of error associated with each absorbing set, a directed-edge Tanner graph is used to link absorbing sets to low-weight deviations. These low-weight deviations result when a proportionally large number of nodes within a stopping set belong to an absorbing set contained inside the stopping set. A complete collection of the most problematic absorbing sets, and the minimum deviation weights that result from them, are used to derive a conditional upper bound on the probability of error for min-sum decoding of low-density parity-check codes. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the bound.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091012.110830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.091012.110830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06302118.pdf","startPage":"3567","endPage":"3578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deviation-Based Conditional Upper Bound on the Error Floor Performance for Min-Sum Decoding of Short LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Deviation-Based Conditional Upper Bound on the Error Floor Performance for Min-Sum Decoding of Short LDPC Codes","volume":"60","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6302118/","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188485","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302118/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deviation-Based Conditional Upper Bound on the Error Floor Performance for Min-Sum Decoding of Short LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"3567-tc1212-psota.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106994S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6302118","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6302121,"authors":[{"name":"Minsu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6609031/6302121/6302121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minsu Huang received the BEng degree in mechanical engineering from Central South University, in 2003 and the MS degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, in 2006.

Previous DTN research mainly focuses on routing and information propagation. However, with a large number of wireless devices' participation, it becomes crucial regarding how to maintain efficient and dynamic topology of the DTN. In this paper, we study the topology control problem in a predictable DTN, where the time-evolving network topology is known a priori or can be predicted. We first model such time-evolving network as a directed space-time graph that includes both spacial and temporal information. The aim of topology control is to build a sparse structure from the original space-time graph such that 1) the network is still connected over time and supports DTN routing between any two nodes; 2) the total cost of the structure is minimized. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and propose two greedy-based methods that can significantly reduce the total cost of topology while maintaining the connectivity over time. We also introduce another version of the topology control problem by requiring that the least cost path for any two nodes in this constructed structure is still cost-efficient compared with the one in the original graph. Two greedy-based methods are provided for such a problem. Simulations have been conducted on both random DTN networks and real-world DTN tracing data. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13795171","volume":"62","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6302121/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Topology Control for Time-Evolving and Predictable Delay-Tolerant Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Control for Time-Evolving and Predictable Delay-Tolerant Networks","sourcePdf":"ttc2013112308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111574S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6609031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6609031","articleId":"6302121","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6302124,"authors":[{"name":"Sujay Deb","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6651933/6302124/6302124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sujay Deb received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from Washington State University in February 2012.

The existing methods of implementing a NoC with planar metal interconnects are deficient due to high latency and significant power consumption arising out of multihop links used in data exchange. To address these problems, we propose design of a hierarchical small-world wireless NoC architecture where the multihop wire interconnects are replaced with high-bandwidth and single-hop long-range wireless shortcuts operating in the millimeter (mm)-wave frequency range. The proposed mm-wave wireless NoC (mWNoC) outperforms the corresponding conventional wireline counterpart in terms of achievable bandwidth and is significantly more energy efficient. The performance improvement is achieved through efficient data routing and optimum placement of wireless hubs. Multiple wireless shortcuts operating simultaneously further enhance the performance, and provide an energy-efficient solution for design of communication infrastructures for multicore chips.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.224","startPage":"2382","endPage":"2396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6651933/06302124.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6651933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Energy-Efficient CMOS-Compatible NoC Architecture with Millimeter-Wave Wireless Interconnects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Energy-Efficient CMOS-Compatible NoC Architecture with Millimeter-Wave Wireless Interconnects","volume":"62","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13878641","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6302124/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Energy-Efficient CMOS-Compatible NoC Architecture with Millimeter-Wave Wireless Interconnects","sourcePdf":"ttc2013122382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108045S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6651933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6651933","articleId":"6302124","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6302125,"authors":[{"name":"Silvia Franchini","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory DICGIM Department, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6651933/6302125/6302125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Silvia Franchini received the laurea degree in electrical engineering and the doctoral degree in computer engineering from the University of Palermo, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

Operating in higher dimensional spaces, its practical use is hindered, however, by a significant computational cost, only partially addressed by dedicated software libraries and hardware/software codesigns. For low-dimensional algebras, several dedicated hardware accelerators and coprocessing architectures have been already proposed in the literature. This paper introduces the architecture of CliffordALU5, an embedded coprocessing core conceived for native execution of up to 5D CA operations. CliffordALU5 exploits a novel, hardware-oriented representation of the algebra elements that allows for faster execution of Clifford operations. In this paper, a prototype implementation of a complete system-on-chip (SOC) based on CliffordALU5 is presented. This prototype integrates an embedded processing soft-core based on the PowerPC 405 and a CliffordALU5 coprocessor on a Xilinx XUPV2P Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. Test results show a 5\u00d7 average speedup for 4D Clifford products and a 4\u00d7 average speedup for 5D Clifford products against the same operations in Gaigen 2, a CA software library generator running on the general-purpose PowerPC processor. This paper also presents an execution analysis of three different applications in three diverse domains, namely, inverse kinematics of a robot, optical motion capture, and raytracing, showing an average speedup between 3\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 with respect to the baseline Gaigen 2 implementation. Finally, a multicore approach to higher dimensional CA based on CliffordALU5 is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6651933/06302125.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6651933","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Embedded Coprocessor with Native Support for 5D, Quadruple-Based Clifford Algebra","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Embedded Coprocessor with Native Support for 5D, Quadruple-Based Clifford Algebra","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13878647","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6302125/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an Embedded Coprocessor with Native Support for 5D, Quadruple-Based Clifford Algebra","sourcePdf":"ttc2013122366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105126S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6651933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6651933","articleId":"6302125","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6302129,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Tang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6570483/6302129/6302129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Tang received the BS degree in computer science from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree with the Department of Computer Science and Technology.

When numerous bidirectional flows pass through the relay stations in an OFDMA relay network that supports various interactive applications, plenty of network coding opportunities arise and can be leveraged to enhance the throughput. In this paper, we study the proportional-fair scheduling problem in the presence of network coding in OFDMA relay networks. Considering the tradeoff between performance and overhead, we propose two models, global approach (GA) and local approach (LA), under which the corresponding problems are shown both NP-hard. For the GA model, we show that it cannot be approximated within some constant factor. Hence, we propose a heuristic algorithm with low time complexity. For the LA model, we propose a theoretical polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS), and also present a practical greedy algorithm with approximation factor of 1/2. Simulation results show that our algorithms can achieve significant throughput improvement over a state-of-the-art noncoding scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6570483/06302129.pdf","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2012.269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6570483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding-Aware Proportional-Fair Scheduling in OFDMA Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Network coding","Downlink","Approximation algorithms","Scheduling","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","greedy algorithms","Long Term Evolution","network coding","OFDM modulation","optimisation","polynomial approximation","relay networks (telecommunication)","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA relay networks","coding-aware proportional-fair scheduling","4G standards","IEEE 802.16j","3GPP LTE-Advanced","broadband wireless access","interactive applications","network coding","global approach","local approach","NP-hard problem","heuristic algorithm","time complexity","polynomial time approximation scheme","PTAS","greedy algorithm","approximation factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","OFDMA relay networks","proportional-fair scheduling","approximation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Coding-Aware Proportional-Fair Scheduling in OFDMA Relay Networks","volume":"24","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6302129/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13656076","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding-Aware Proportional-Fair Scheduling in OFDMA Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2013091727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153196S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6570483","articleId":"6302129","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6302132,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Computing Center, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6570483/6302132/6302132-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanfeng Zhang received the BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees in computer science from Northeastern University, China, in 2005, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

These applications typically involve data sets of massive scale. Fast convergence of the iterative computations on the massive data set is essential for these applications. In this paper, we explore the opportunity for accelerating iterative computations by prioritization. Instead of performing computations on all data points without discrimination, we prioritize the computations that help convergence the most, so that the convergence speed of iterative process is significantly improved. We develop a distributed computing framework, PrIter, which supports the prioritized execution of iterative computations. PrIter either stores intermediate data in memory for fast convergence or stores intermediate data in files for scaling to larger data sets. We evaluate PrIter on a local cluster of machines as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud. The results show that PrIter achieves up to 50 \u00d7 speedup over Hadoop for a series of iterative algorithms. In addition, PrIter is shown better performance for iterative computations than other state-of-the-art distributed frameworks such as Spark and Piccolo.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13656079","htmlLink":"/document/6302132/","displayDocTitle":"PrIter: A Distributed Framework for Prioritizing Iterative Computations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PrIter: A Distributed Framework for Prioritizing Iterative Computations","sourcePdf":"ttd2013091884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099382S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6570483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6570483","articleId":"6302132","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":6302133,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6604394/6302133/6302133-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Hong received the BS and MS degrees in automatic control from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

This paper investigates the economic incentive for a cellular operator to add femtocell service on top of its existing macrocell service. We model the interactions between a cellular operator and users as a Stackelberg game: The operator first determines spectrum allocations and pricings of femtocell and macrocell services, and then heterogeneous users choose between the two services and the amount of resource to request. In the ideal case where the femtocell service has the same full spatial coverage as the macrocell service, we show that the operator will choose to provide femtocell service only, as this leads to a better user quality of service and a higher operator profit. However, if we impose the constraint that no users' payoffs decrease after introducing the femtocell service, then the operator will always continue providing the macrocell service (with or without the femtocell service). Furthermore, we study the impact of operational cost, limited coverage, and spatial reuse on femtocell service provision. As the operational cost increases, fewer users are served by femtocell service and the operator's profit decreases. When the femtocell service has limited spatial coverage, the operator always provides the macrocell service beside the femtocell service. However, when the coverage is high or the total resource is low, the operator will set the prices such that all users who can access femtocell will choose to use the femtocell service only. Finally, spatial reuse of spectrum will increase the efficiency of femtocell services and gives the operator more incentives to allocate spectrum to femtocells.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06302134.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","startPage":"2261","endPage":"2273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economics of Femtocell Service Provision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Economics of Femtocell Service Provision","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795126","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6302134/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economics of Femtocell Service Provision","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079546S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6604394","articleId":"6302134","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6302137,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Pantisano","affiliation":["Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6604394/6302137/6302137-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Pantisano received the BSc and MSc (with honors) degrees in telecommunication engineering from the University of Bologna, Italy, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

However, one of the major challenges in femtocell deployments is managing interference. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative solution that enables femtocells to improve their achievable data rates, by suppressing intratier interference using the concept of interference alignment (IA). We model this cooperative behavior among the femtocells as a coalitional game in partition form and we propose a distributed algorithm for the coalition formation. The proposed algorithm allows the femtocell base stations to independently decide on whether to cooperate or not, while maximizing a utility function capturing both the gains and costs from cooperation. Using the proposed algorithm, the femtocells can self-organize into a stable network partition composed of disjoint femtocell coalitions and which constitutes the recursive core of the game. Inside every coalition, cooperative femtocells use advanced IA techniques to improve their downlink transmission rate. Simulation results show that the proposed coalition formation algorithm yields significant gains, in terms of average payoff per femtocell, reaching up to 30 percent relative to the noncooperative case for a network of N=300 femtocells.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06302137.pdf","startPage":"2233","endPage":"2246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment for Cooperative Femtocell Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment for Cooperative Femtocell Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302137/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13795121","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6302137/","volume":"12","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment for Cooperative Femtocell Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145618S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6604394","articleId":"6302137","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6302142,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Ho Chan","affiliation":["Center for Vision, University of Surrey, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6482541/6302142/6302142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi Ho Chan received the PhD degree from the University of Surrey, United Kingdom, in 2008.

Interestingly, image degradation caused by blurring, often present in real-world imagery, has mostly been overlooked by the face recognition community. Such degradation corrupts face information and affects image alignment, which together negatively impact recognition accuracy. We propose a number of countermeasures designed to achieve system robustness to blurring. First, we propose a novel blur-robust face image descriptor based on Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) and extend it to a multiscale framework (MLPQ) to increase its effectiveness. To maximize the insensitivity to misalignment, the MLPQ descriptor is computed regionally by adopting a component-based framework. Second, the regional features are combined using kernel fusion. Third, the proposed MLPQ representation is combined with the Multiscale Local Binary Pattern (MLBP) descriptor using kernel fusion to increase insensitivity to illumination. Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) of the combined features extracts discriminative information for face recognition. Last, two geometric normalizations are used to generate and combine multiple scores from different face image scales to further enhance the accuracy. The proposed approach has been comprehensively evaluated using the combined Yale and Extended Yale database B (degraded by artificially induced linear motion blur) as well as the FERET, FRGC 2.0, and LFW databases. The combined system is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches using similar system configurations. The reported work provides a new insight into the merits of various face representation and fusion methods, as well as their role in dealing with variable lighting and blur degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6482541/06302142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482541","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Local Phase Quantization for Robust Component-Based Face Recognition Using Kernel Fusion of Multiple Descriptors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Local Phase Quantization for Robust Component-Based Face Recognition Using Kernel Fusion of Multiple Descriptors","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13401260","pubMedId":"23520257","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6302142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Local Phase Quantization for Robust Component-Based Face Recognition Using Kernel Fusion of Multiple Descriptors","sourcePdf":"ttp2013051164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098976S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6482541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6482541","articleId":"6302142","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6302162,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Grebennikov","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories Ireland, Alcatel-Lucent, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6351844/6302162/6302162-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrei Grebennikov (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Dipl.

In the case of partial scatterers, the mainstream has so far been twofold, in that the tomographic reconstruction is conducted by either directly working with multiple looks and/or polarimetric channels or by exploiting the corresponding single-channel second-order statistics. In this letter, we unify these two methodologies in the context of covariance fitting. In essence, we exploit the fact that both vertical structures and the unknown polarimetric signatures can be approximated in a low-dimensional subspace. For this purpose, we make use of a wavelet basis in order to sparsely represent vertical structures. Additionally, we synthesize a data-adaptive orthonormal basis that spans the space of polarimetric signatures. Finally, we validate this approach by using fully polarimetric L-band data acquired by the E-SAR sensor of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2012.2212693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6361358/06302171.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2212693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Adaptive Compressed Sensing Approach to Polarimetric SAR Tomography of Forested Areas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302171/","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Adaptive Compressed Sensing Approach to Polarimetric SAR Tomography of Forested Areas","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146576","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6302171/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Adaptive Compressed Sensing Approach to Polarimetric SAR Tomography of Forested Areas","sourcePdf":"lgrs-aguilera-2212693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085689S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6361358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6361358","articleId":"6302171","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6302183,"authors":[{"name":"Fridolin H.

Thirty-four of which were from winter upward lightning and only one from summer upward lightning. It appears that all of the winter upward lightning were initiated without nearby preceding lightning activity (called \u201cself-initiated\u201d lightning) and only the summer lightning was triggered by nearby lightning activity (called \u201cother-triggered\u201d lightning). The slow-varying electric fields of the winter upward lightning showed a fast rise characterized by the 10-90% risetime, with an arithmetic mean of 13.8 ms. After attaining the maximum, the electric field turned into a slow decay being characterized by the time on half value which was evaluated to having the arithmetic mean of 441 ms. Transported charges to ground were on average 44.8 C and on maximum 165 C. The maximum value of the electric field was 39.9 kV/m on average, with the highest value being 64.5 kV/m. For the electric fields, higher values were prevented by recovery effects such as the corona from objects at ground and the redistribution of the charge in the thundercloud. Due to these effects, no or only weak correlations were found between the 10-90% risetime, the time on half value, the charge, and the maximum of the electric field. From additional measurements with a field mill, it was found that the electric field recovers to the starting level within some seconds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","volume":"55","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13429704","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6302183/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Slow-Varying Electric Field of Negative Upward Lightning Initiated by the Peissenberg Tower, Germany","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Slow-Varying Electric Field of Negative Upward Lightning Initiated by the Peissenberg Tower, Germany","sourcePdf":"temc-heidler-2209121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068859S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6497105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6497105","articleId":"6302183","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":6302189,"authors":[{"name":"Benjam\u00edn E.

High-level offline models corresponding to the recognized category are then adaptively selected and combined with low-level online tracking models so as to achieve better tracking performance.

Although they demonstrated the existence of such codes, their proof does not provide an explicit construction of codes for this task. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit \u201cpolar\u201d codes that are capacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon observed by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is an effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by \u201cchannel combining\u201d and \u201cchannel splitting,\u201d in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are perfect for data transmission, while the other channels are completely useless for data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the channel. The channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for data transmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and \u201cfrozen\u201d bits through the useless ones. The main technical contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we leverage several known results from the quantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarization effect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. We then construct linear polar codes based on this effect, and the encoding complexity is \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\nlog\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n), where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is the blocklength of the code. We also demonstrate that a quantum successive cancellation decoder works well, in the sense that the word error rate decays exponentially with the blocklength of the code.

However, the lack of request-to-send/clear-to-send handshaking and packet acknowledgment makes the communication more vulnerable to interferences, thus resulting in lower communication reliability. In this paper, we present an analytical model for the performance evaluation of safety message dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks with two priority classes. In particular, considering the IEEE 802.11 broadcast protocol and using 2-D Markov modeling, we derive the joint distribution of the numbers of low-priority periodic messages, which are in transmission mode and in a backoff process in a highway. Then, the result is used to derive the average dissemination delay of high-priority event-driven messages in the presence of the low-priority traffic in the network. The results are helpful in determining a good tradeoff between network parameters such as vehicles' transmission range, safety traffic generation rate, and medium access control (MAC) parameters to satisfy the required delay bounds for the critical high-priority traffic.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2012.2213595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6470717/06302199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2012.2213595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6470717","startPage":"380","endPage":"387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Modeling of Safety Messages Broadcast in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Modeling of Safety Messages Broadcast in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13565858","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6302199/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Modeling of Safety Messages Broadcast in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-khabazian-2213595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123327S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6470717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6470717","articleId":"6302199","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6302200,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Biddlestone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6357363/6302200/6302200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Scott Biddlestone (S'01) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering with a minor in Japanese from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, IN, in 2005.

Multiple safety applications and control algorithms have been proposed to use 802.11p Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) radios and message structures. An urban environment provides many challenges for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. These include multiple propagation paths and many occlusions, particularly in areas where V2V messages would be most useful such as blind spots, buildings, and other obstructions. The dense urban environments and high concentration of vehicles make it difficult to predict how reliable this communication will be. The Ohio State University's Vehicle and Traffic Simulator (VaTSim) is designed as a microsimulator of traffic. This paper describes the incorporation of V2V communication into VaTSim using Network Simulator 3 (NS3) and physical layer modeling to determine how different road layouts and building configurations will affect 802.11p communication. This paper explains the theory used to define the simulated line-of-sight (LOS) propagation, non-LOS (NLOS) propagation calculations, channel switching congestion, and the experiments performed to validate the models and the simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6357363/06302200.pdf","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2012.2213816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2012.2213816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6302200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated 802.11p WAVE DSRC and Vehicle Traffic Simulator With Experimentally Validated Urban (LOS and NLOS) Propagation Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","IEEE standards","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Simulation","Intelligent vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","radiowave propagation","road traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Integrated 802.11p WAVE DSRC","vehicle traffic simulator","experimentally vehicle urban propagation models","NLOS propagation models","LOS propagation models","1609.3, WAVE standards","IEEE 802.11p, WAVE standards","1609.4 WAVE standards","vehicle-to-vehicle communication","vehicle-to-infrastructure communication","802.11p dedicated short-range communication","DSRC radios","DSRC message structures","Ohio State University Vehicle","traffic simulator","VaTSim","network simulator 3","NS3","physical layer modeling","line-of-sight propagation","non-LOS propagation calculations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC)/WAVE","IEEE 1609","IEEE 802.11p","IEEE 802.11 standards","intelligent vehicles","mobile communication","modeling","NS3","radio propagation","road transportation","simulation","vehicle safety","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","wireless mobile communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated 802.11p WAVE DSRC and Vehicle Traffic Simulator With Experimentally Validated Urban (LOS and NLOS) Propagation Models","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6302200/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148951","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated 802.11p WAVE DSRC and Vehicle Traffic Simulator With Experimentally Validated Urban (LOS and NLOS) Propagation Models","sourcePdf":"tits-redmill-2213816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092657S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6357363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6357363","articleId":"6302200","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6302202,"authors":[{"name":"Tareq Y.

The proposed algorithm is able to recover the transmitted data even when the channel changes on a symbol-by-symbol basis, making it suitable for fast fading channels. The proposed algorithm does not require any statistical information about the channel and thus does not suffer from latency normally associated with blind methods. The paper demonstrates how to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, which becomes especially low at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The refinement greatly improves the estimation accuracy especially when two point sources are closely spaced. Numerical experiments show that the proposed GBCD algorithm has several notable advantages over the existing DOA estimation methods, such as fast convergence rate, accurate reconstruction, and noise resistance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6302205/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13146547","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DOA Estimation Using a Greedy Block Coordinate Descent Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA Estimation Using a Greedy Block Coordinate Descent Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-ling-2218812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077893S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6357313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6357313","articleId":"6302205","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6302206,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6357313/6302206/6302206-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Wang (S'11) received the B.S. degree in material engineering and the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering in Korea University, Seoul.

In this paper, we introduce an extension of the OMP for pursuing efficiency in reconstructing sparse signals.

Owing to the selection of multiple \u201ccorrect\u201d indices, the gOMP algorithm is finished with much smaller number of iterations when compared to the OMP.

The TSAR examines the transient information of a typical dynamic SAR voltage comparator to provide accuracy, speed, and power benefits. Full half-bit redundancy is shown, allowing for residue shaping which provides an additional 6 dB of signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR). Synchronous quantizer speed enhancements allow for a shorter worst case conversion time. An increased monotonicity switching algorithm, stage skipping due to reference grouping, and SAR logic modifications minimize overall dynamic energy. The architecture has been shown to reduce capacitor array switching power consumption and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) driver power by about 60% in a mismatch limited SAR, reduce comparator activity by about 20%, and require only 8.03 average comparisons and 6.53 average DAC movements for a 10-b ADC output word.

It involves runtime power characterization of a fabricated chip under realistic loadings. The most versatile procedure for post-silicon power characterization involves capturing the thermal emissions from the back of the die and inverting the captured images to get power estimates. This process faces two major challenges: the spatial heat diffusion effect, which blurs the underlying power map, and measurement noise in the thermal imaging system. In this paper, we propose to use ac-based thermography, where ac excitation signals are applied to the chip instead of dc excitation signals, to improve post-silicon power mapping. We show that using ac excitation reduces the impact of flicker noise and spatial heat diffusion, which translates to significant improvements in power mapping accuracy. We perform a number of experiments using a test chip that can be programmed to control spatial and temporal power consumption. We use the test chip to analyze the noise in our thermal imaging system, and to quantify the improvements in power mapping attained from the proposed ac-based methodology. We elucidate the impact of the ac excitation frequency on both the signal-to-noise ratio and power mapping accuracy. We also demonstrate the basic applicability of our technique on a dual-core processor.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2211111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2211111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6565423/06302281.pdf","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Mapping of Integrated Circuits Using AC-Based Thermography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6302281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Power Mapping of Integrated Circuits Using AC-Based Thermography","volume":"21","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13693093","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6302281/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Mapping of Integrated Circuits Using AC-Based Thermography","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-reda-2211111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094165S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6565423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6565423","articleId":"6302281","onlineDate":"13 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6302312,"authors":[{"name":"Kingsley Fregene","affiliation":["Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories, Cherry Hill, NJ, US"],"bio":{"p":["Kingsley Fregene (kingsley.fregene@lmco.com) is a principal research scientist at Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Labs in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

Accordingly, automatically mining and annotating high-level concepts for video indexing and management become imperative research tasks in both multimedia research and data mining research. The mainstream content-based semantic concept mining approaches suffer from the notorious semantic gap problem, which is the difficulty of associating the low-level features to high-level concepts directly. Recently, the utilization of concept-concept association has been proven to be effective to address the semantic gap problem. In this paper, a framework based on multi-model collaboration and information integration is proposed to integrate the association among concepts to enhance the high-level concept detection by reusing the information outputs from the primary concept detectors. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the other approaches in the comparison and therefore is promising.","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2012.6303003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2012.6303003","startPage":"144","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration (IRI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294629/6302564/06303003.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration (IRI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6302564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven collaboration and information integration for enhancing video semantic concept detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven collaboration and information integration for enhancing video semantic concept detection","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6303003/","accessionNumber":"12998754","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303003/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven collaboration and information integration for enhancing video semantic concept detection","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"021070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073929S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294629","isNumber":"6302564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294629","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6302564","articleId":"6303003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6303039,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Abu Shanab","affiliation":["Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad Abu","lastName":"Shanab","id":"37892382600"},{"name":"Taghi M.

Since these datasets often have high dimensionality (a large number of features), selecting the most important ones both improves performance and reduces computation time. In addition, when the features in question are genes (as is the case for microarray datasets), knowing the important genes is useful on its own. Although many studies have examined feature selection in the context of classification performance, few analyze techniques in terms of stability: the ability of a technique to produce the same results (list of genes) regardless of changes to the dataset. In this study, we test the stability of eighteen feature rankers across four high-dimensional cancer-gene datasets. Because these datasets are also imbalanced (fewer positive-class instances than negative-class instances), we employ six versions of data sampling (three techniques with two class ratios). Finally, we inject artificial class noise to better evaluate how the rankers perform on realistic datasets, which can be prone to noise. The results demonstrate that of the rankers, the PRC- and Deviance-based Threshold-Based Feature Selection techniques, along with Signal-to-Noise, show the best stability on average. Results also demonstrate that among the sampling techniques investigated, Random Oversampling and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (both set to a 50:50 class ratio) showed the best performance on average.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Stability criteria","Indexes","Cancer","Lungs","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data handling","medical administrative data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data sampling","noise sampling","feature ranking techniques","biological datasets","feature selection","bioinformatics datasets","microarray datasets","cancer gene datasets","deviance based threshold","feature selection techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gene selection","bioinformatics","feature selection stability","class imbalance","quality of data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRI.2012.6303039","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration (IRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration (IRI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294629/6302564/06303039.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6302564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2012.6303039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of noise and data sampling on stability of feature ranking techniques for biological datasets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6303039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of noise and data sampling on stability of feature ranking techniques for biological datasets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303039/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6303039/","accessionNumber":"12998790","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of noise and data sampling on stability of feature ranking techniques for biological datasets","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"057182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141347S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294629","isNumber":"6302564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294629","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6302564","articleId":"6303039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6303112,"authors":[{"name":"Zi-fa Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China","Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Eelctric Power University, Bejing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6294165/6303088/6303112/6303112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Zifa was born in Heilongjiang, China in 1973.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to separating cochannel speech. Our approach follows the two main stages of computational auditory scene analysis: segmentation and grouping. For voiced speech segregation, the proposed system utilizes a tandem algorithm for simultaneous grouping and then unsupervised clustering for sequential grouping. The clustering is performed by a search to maximize the ratio of between- and within-group speaker distances while penalizing within-group concurrent pitches. To segregate unvoiced speech, we first produce unvoiced speech segments based on onset/offset analysis. The segments are grouped using the complementary binary masks of segregated voiced speech. Despite its simplicity, our approach produces significant SNR improvements across a range of input SNR. The proposed system yields competitive performance in comparison to other speaker-independent and model-based methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","volume":"21","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13061958","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6303834/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Unsupervised Approach to Cochannel Speech Separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Unsupervised Approach to Cochannel Speech Separation","sourcePdf":"tasl-hu-2215591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055793S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6334458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6334458","articleId":"6303834","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6303836,"authors":[{"name":"Linda Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6303836/6303836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Linda Bai (S'09) received the B.

The (mean) time to detect idle channels is governed by the front-end bandwidth to be searched for a given resolution bandwidth. Homodyne receiver architectures with a wideband radio-frequency front-end followed by suitable channelization and digital signal processing algorithms, are consistent with speedier detection, but also imply the need for very high speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that are impractical and/or costly. On the other hand, traditional heterodyne receiver architectures consist of analog band-select filtering followed by down-conversion that require much lower rate ADCs, but at the expense of significant scanning operation steps that constitute a roadblock to lowering the scan duration. In summary, neither architecture provides a satisfactory solution to the goal of (near) real-time wideband spectrum sensing. In this work, we propose a new compressive spectrum sensing architecture based on the principle of under-sampling (or bandpass sampling) that provides a middle ground between the above choices, i.e., our approach requires modest ADC sampling rates and yet achieves fast spectrum scanning. Compared to other compressive spectrum sensing architectures, the proposed method does not require a high-speed Nyquist rate analog component. A performance model for the scanning duration is developed based on the mean time to detect all idle channels. Numerical results show that this scheme provides significantly faster idle channel detection than the conventional serial search scheme with a heterodyne architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6303836/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167796","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Spectrum Sensing Using a Bandpass Sampling Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Spectrum Sensing Using a Bandpass Sampling Architecture","sourcePdf":"jetcas-bai-2214874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066578S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6303836","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6303837,"authors":[{"name":"Chenchi Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6303837/6303837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenchi Luo (S'09) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the M.S. degree, in 2009, from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is currently pursing the Ph.D. degree in the field of digital signal processing.","He spent the summer of 2010 and 2011 as a research intern at the System and Application R&D center of Texas Instruments, Dallas.

It is possible to reduce the analog data acquisition complexity at the cost of extra digital computations with less total power consumption. Using compressive sensing, in order to resolve the positions of the sparse touches, the number of measurements required is related to the number of touches rather than the number of nodes.

Measurements on a class-AB power amplifier (PA) using orthogonal frequency-division multiplex signals show that the peak control works as intended and prevents the MS-ILA from generating high peaks when the PA is operated in compression. The restriction on the peak power also prevents the performance degradation occurring due to the \u201cblow-up\u201d problem. This makes the proposed controlled MS-ILA a safer option than the standard MS-ILA. In addition to controlling the peak input power to the PA, using the proposed method it was possible to increase the output power by 1.3 dB while fulfilling requirements of less than 40-dB adjacent channel leakage power ratio, compared to the standard five-step MS-ILA. Reduced peak power also reduces the requirements on linearity in signal generation, resolution in computations, and analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2213830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6341879/06303847.pdf","startPage":"3582","endPage":"3590","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2213830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-Power Controlled Digital Predistorters for RF Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Peak-Power Controlled Digital Predistorters for RF Power Amplifiers","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6303847/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13100837","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303847/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-Power Controlled Digital Predistorters for RF Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-landin-2213830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070684S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6341879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6341879","articleId":"6303847","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6303851,"authors":[{"name":"Uros Legat","affiliation":["Computer Systems Department, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Uros","lastName":"Legat","id":"37062425900"},{"name":"Anton Biasizzo","affiliation":["Computer Systems Department, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Biasizzo","id":"37390480000"},{"name":"Franc Novak","affiliation":["Computer Systems Department, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Franc","lastName":"Novak","id":"37273602400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"6303851","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":830},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6303851","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Error correction codes","Single event upset","Random access memory","Circuit faults","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM-based FPGA","SRAM-based field-programmable gate arrays","mission-critical systems","error-mitigation technique","recovery technique","high-energy radiation","single event upsets","modular redundancy","runtime partial reconfiguration","different tradeoff feature","fault latency","low area-overhead SEU recovery mechanism","self-recoverable architectures","experimental evaluation","special designed fault-emulation environment","fault injection","configuration memory selected locations","developed solution reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault emulation","partial runtime reconfiguration","self-recovery","single event upset"]}],"abstract":"The application of SRAM-based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in mission-critical systems requires error-mitigation and recovery techniques to protect them from the errors caused by high-energy radiation, also known as single event upsets (SEUs). For this, modular redundancy and runtime partial reconfiguration are commonly employed techniques. However, the reported solutions feature different tradeoffs in the area overhead and the fault latency. In this paper, we propose a low area-overhead SEU recovery mechanism and describe its application in different self-recoverable architectures, which are experimentally evaluated using a specially designed fault-emulation environment. The environment enables the user to inject faults at selected locations of the configuration memory and experimentally evaluate the reliability of the developed solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2012.2211617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear

This brief analyzes the effect of nonequal level spacing in a three-level \u03a3\u0394 output and provides a method for shaping the corresponding error noise to regions outside the band of interest. Subsequently, the nonlinearity-shaping property is utilized to obtain an improved two-level drive signal based on three-level \u03a3\u0394 modulation. The new binary drive signal is proven to have better adjacent channel leakage ratio and higher coding efficiency than a conventional two-level \u03a3\u0394 modulator. In the investigated case, measured coding efficiency improves from 8.9% of the conventional two-level modulator to 21% of the modified two-level modulator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6329981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2012.2213432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6329981/06303882.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"622","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2012.2213432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Coding-Efficiency Two-Level Source Encoder for RF Switch-Mode Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Improved Coding-Efficiency Two-Level Source Encoder for RF Switch-Mode Power Amplifiers","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6303882/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13039023","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Coding-Efficiency Two-Level Source Encoder for RF Switch-Mode Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcsii-podsiadlik-2213432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045801S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6329981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6329981","articleId":"6303882","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6303885,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Amin","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Amin","id":"37296908300"},{"name":"Xavier Litrico","affiliation":["Research and Development Center of Lyonnaise des Eaux, Bordeaux, France"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Litrico","id":"37301319500"},{"name":"Shankar Sastry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shankar","lastName":"Sastry","id":"37270557300"},{"name":"Alexandre M.

To address the multiplicative nature, we first make the speckle contribution additive by a linear decomposition. Then, in the stationary wavelet transform domain, a two-sided generalized Gamma distribution (GTD) is introduced as a prior to capture the heavy-tailed nature of wavelet coefficients of the noise-free reflectivity. By exploiting this prior together with a Gaussian likelihood, an analytical wavelet shrinkage function is derived based on maximum a posteriori criteria, which further adopts heterogeneity-adaptive thresholding technique to achieve better estimates of noise-free wavelet coefficients. Moreover, a pilot-signal-assisted strategy is proposed to estimate the parameters of two-sided GTD with the estimator based on second-kind cumulants. Finally, experimental results, carried out on the synthetic and actual SAR images, are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed despeckling method.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2211366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2388","endPage":"2402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2211366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484140","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6484140/06303903.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Synthetic aperture radar","Wavelet transforms","Bayesian methods","Noise","Additives","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","gamma distribution","Gaussian processes","higher order statistics","image denoising","image segmentation","maximum likelihood estimation","parameter estimation","radar imaging","speckle","synthetic aperture radar","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian wavelet shrinkage","heterogeneity-adaptive threshold","SAR image despeckling","synthetic aperture radar","multiplicative speckle noise","human interpretation","computer-aided scene analysis","Bayesian multiscale method","nonhomomorphic framework","speckle contribution additive","linear decomposition","stationary wavelet transform domain","two-sided generalized Gamma distribution","noise-free reflectivity","Gaussian likelihood","analytical wavelet shrinkage function","maximum a posteriori criteria","heterogeneity-adaptive thresholding technique","noise-free wavelet coefficient","pilot-signal-assisted strategy","parameter estimation","second-kind cumulant","G\u0393D"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized gamma distribution","maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation","second-kind cumulants","speckle reduction","stationary wavelet transform (SWT)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Wavelet Shrinkage With Heterogeneity-Adaptive Threshold for SAR Image Despeckling Based on Generalized Gamma Distribution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303903/","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6303903/","accessionNumber":"13396639","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Wavelet Shrinkage With Heterogeneity-Adaptive Threshold for SAR Image Despeckling Based on Generalized Gamma Distribution","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2211366-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098445S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6484140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6484140","articleId":"6303903","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6303906,"authors":[{"name":"Yongcan Cao","affiliation":["Control Science Center of Excellence, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yongcan Cao (M\u201911) received the B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in from Utah State University, Logan, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.","He is with the Control Science Center of Excellence, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.

In this model, multiple interfering clusters of users communicate simultaneously, such that the users within the same cluster wish to exchange messages among themselves, i.e., each user multicasts its message to all the other users in its own cluster. It is assumed that the users cannot receive each other's signals directly. Hence, the relay terminal in this model is the enabler of communication. In particular, restricted encoders are considered, such that the encoding function of each user depends only on its own message and the received signal is used only for decoding the messages of the other users in the cluster. Achievable rate regions and an outer bound are characterized for the Gaussian mRC, and their comparison is presented in terms of the exchange rate, the symmetric rate point in the capacity region in a symmetric Gaussian mRC scenario. It is shown that the compress-and-forward (CF) protocol achieves exchange rates within a constant bit offset of the optimal exchange rate, independent of the power constraints of the terminals in the network. A finite bit gap between the exchange rates achieved by the CF and the amplify-and-forward protocols is also shown. The two special cases of the mRC, the full data exchange model, in which every user wants to receive messages of all other users, and the pairwise data exchange model which consists of multiple two-way relay channels, are investigated in detail. In particular for the pairwise data exchange model, in addition to the proposed random coding-based achievable schemes, a nested lattice coding-based scheme is also presented and is shown to achieve exchange rates within a constant bit gap of the exchange capacity.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2219156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2219156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6387658/06303911.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Multiway Relay Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Multiway Relay Channel","volume":"59","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6303911/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187839","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Multiway Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-gunduz-2219156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144101S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6387658","articleId":"6303911","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6303915,"authors":[{"name":"Ryuhei Mori","affiliation":["Department of System Science, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Ryuhei Mori received the B.E. degree from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan in 2008, and the M.Inf. degree from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan in 2010.

The subMICs are bidirectional isolated dc-dc converters capable of injecting or subtracting currents to balance the module substring voltages. When no mismatches are present, the subMICs are simply shut down, resulting in zero insertion losses. It is shown that the objective of minimum subMIC power processing can be solved as a linear programming problem. A simple close-to-optimal distributed control approach is presented that allows autonomous subMIC control without the need for a central controller or any communication among the subMICs. Furthermore, the proposed control approach is well suited for an isolated-port architecture, which yields additional practical advantages including reduced subMIC power and voltage ratings. The architectures and the control approach are validated by simulations and experimental results using three bidirectional flyback subMICs attached to a standard 180-W, 72-cell PV module, yielding greater than 98% module-level power processing efficiency for a mismatch less than 25%.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2219073","startPage":"2980","endPage":"2997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2219073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6376188/06303921.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectures and Control of Submodule Integrated DC\u2013DC Converters for Photovoltaic Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303921/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Architectures and Control of Submodule Integrated DC\u2013DC Converters for Photovoltaic Applications","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6303921/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13167884","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectures and Control of Submodule Integrated DC\u2013DC Converters for Photovoltaic Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-olalla-2219073-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164555S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6376188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"6376188","articleId":"6303921","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6303922,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Traube","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6303922/6303922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joshua Traube (M\u201910) received the B.S. degree in earth systems from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is also a Research Assistant at the Colorado Power Electronics Center (CoPEC), University of Colorado.

Furthermore, increased penetration of electric vehicle (EV) loads presents a challenge for distribution feeders. This paper presents a system where a bidirectional, highly efficient, dc-dc EV charger is placed between the high-voltage dc bus of a PV inverter and the EV battery. The system partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses sizing of the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating, the desired maximum ramp rate, and site solar irradiation characteristics, including geographic dispersion of PV arrays. Analysis suggests that small amounts of energy storage can accomplish large reductions in output power ramp rate. Experimental results are shown for a 10 kW, 98% efficient dc-dc charger based on bidirectional four-phase zero-voltage-switching converter.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2217354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6376188/06303922.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2217354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376188","startPage":"3058","endPage":"3067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of Solar Irradiance Intermittency in Photovoltaic Power Systems With Integrated Electric-Vehicle Charging Functionality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6303922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of Solar Irradiance Intermittency in Photovoltaic Power Systems With Integrated Electric-Vehicle Charging Functionality","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13167885","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6303922/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of Solar Irradiance Intermittency in Photovoltaic Power Systems With Integrated Electric-Vehicle Charging Functionality","sourcePdf":"tpel-traube-2217354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147857S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6376188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6376188","articleId":"6303922","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6303937,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jen Huang","affiliation":["Advanced Reliable Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6303923/6303937/6303937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Jen Huang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 2004 and 2012, respectively.","She has been with the Test-Chip Design Department, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Hsinchu, Taiwan, since 2012.

Furthermore, a global fusing methodology is proposed to reduce the requirement of fuses. Simulation and analysis results show that the proposed BISR scheme can drastically reduce the area cost and test time in comparison with an existing TSV repair scheme for the same final yield of TSVs under repair.

In addition, the microcontacts are influenced by the small-scale surface roughness. It is widely recognized that the constriction resistance is determined partly by the number and size of the microcontacts and partly by their grouping into clusters. This paper focuses on a parameter study and on the design of the microcontact clusters in terms of the electrical contact resistance (ECR). This paper investigates the positioning and/or sizing optimization of microcontact spots in order to minimize the ECR. The optimal solutions are obtained by a novel method of a real-coded genetic-algorithm implemented with a subpopulation-based selection method and a normal-distribution-probability-based crossover. Also, this paper emphasizes the advantage of the formal optimization method when a total contact area limitation is imposed as a constraint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13100869","volume":"2","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6303967/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic-Algorithm-Based Controlling of Microcontact Distributions to Minimize Electrical Contact Resistance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic-Algorithm-Based Controlling of Microcontact Distributions to Minimize Electrical Contact Resistance","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-jang-2213087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094797S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6342919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6342919","articleId":"6303967","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6303968,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Lall","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, NSF Center for Advanced Vehicle and Extreme Environment Electronics, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6342919/6303968/6303968-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pradeep Lall (S'90\u2013M'93\u2013SM'08\u2013F'12) received the B.E. degree from the Delhi College of Engineering, New Delhi, India, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1988, 1989 and 1993, respectively, all in mechanical engineering, and the M.B.A. degree from the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 2002.","He was with Motorola's Wireless Technology Center.

The BIST, which is extensively used for diagnostics or identification of failure, is focused on reactive failure detection and provides limited insight into reliability and residual life. In this paper, a new technique has been developed for health monitoring and failure mode classification based on measured damage precursors. A feature extraction technique in the joint-time-frequency analysis (JTFA) domain has been developed along with pattern classifiers for fault diagnosis of electronics at the product level. The Karhunen Lo\u00e9ve transform (KLT) has been used for feature reduction and de-correlation of the feature vectors for fault-mode classification in electronic assemblies. Euclidean, and Mahalanobis, and Bayesian distance classifiers based on JTFA, have been used for classification of the resulting feature space. Previously, the authors have developed damage precursors based on time and spectral techniques for health monitoring of electronics without reliance on continuity data from daisy-chained packages. Statistical pattern recognition techniques based on wavelet packet energy decomposition have been studied by authors for quantification of shock damage in electronic assemblies and auto-regressive moving average; time-frequency techniques have been investigated for system identification, condition monitoring, and fault detection and diagnosis in electronic systems. However, identification of specific failure modes is not possible. In this paper, various fault modes, such as solder interconnect failure, interconnect missing, chip delamination, chip cracking etc., in various packaging architectures have been classified using clustering of feature vectors based on the KLT approach. The KLT de-correlates the feature space and identifies dominant directions to describe the space, eliminating directions that encode little useful information about the features. The clustered damage precursors have been correlated with underlying damage. Several chip-scale packages have been studied with lead-free second-level interconnects, including SAC105, SAC305 alloys. Transient strain has been measured during the drop event using digital image correlation and high-speed cameras operating at 100 000 frames/s. Continuity has been monitored simultaneously for failure identification. Fault-mode classification has been done using KLT and JTFA analysis of the experimental data. In addition, explicit finite element models have been developed, and various kinds of failure modes have been simulated, such as solder ball cracking, trace fracture, package falloff, and solder ball failure. Models using cohesive elements present at the solder joint-copper pad interface at both the printed circuit board and package side have also been created to study the traction-separation behavior of solder. Fault modes predicted by simulation-based precursors have been correlated with those from experimental data.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2207460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6342919/06303968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2207460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342919","startPage":"1902","endPage":"1918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Classification for PHM of Electronics Subjected to Shock and Vibration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6303968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Classification for PHM of Electronics Subjected to Shock and Vibration","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6303968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13100870","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6303968/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection and Classification for PHM of Electronics Subjected to Shock and Vibration","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-lall-2207460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092553S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6342919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6342919","articleId":"6303968","onlineDate":"14 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6304306,"authors":[{"name":"Kelly R.

The incorporation of such technology into vast existing utility infrastructures offers many advantages, including possibilities for new smart appliances, energy management systems, better integration of renewable energy, value added services, and new business models, both for supply-and demand-side management. Smart grid also replaces aging utility technologies that are becoming increasingly unreliable, as the average ages for many critical components in utility systems now exceed their original design lives. However, while smart grid offers the promise of revolutionizing utility delivery systems, many questions remain about how such systems can be rolled out at the state, regional, and national levels. Many unique regulatory and market structure challenges exist, which makes it critical to pick the right technology for the right situation and to employ it in the right manner. Technology Roadmapping may be a valuable approach for helping to understand factors that could affect smart grid technology and product development, as well as key business, policy, and market drivers. As emerging smart grid technologies are developed and the fledgling industry matures, a critical issue will be understanding how the combination of industry drivers impact one another, with technology development informing the development of business or service models, which in turn can lead to rethinking of policy and market structures. This will be a co-evolutionary process. To better understand how this could affect future smart grid roadmaps in both Oregon and the Pacific Northwest region, this research proposes to build upon existing roadmapping processes by adding decision modeling tools which incorporate key metrics defined by experts. This will create a more robust roadmap that will allow key variables to be tested and different pathways to be explored.","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of PICMET '12: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of PICMET '12: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6296788/6304012/06304306.pdf","startPage":"2871","endPage":"2885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6304012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated technology roadmap development process: Creating smart grid roadmaps to meet regional technology planning needs in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304306","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2012-Aug. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304306/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated technology roadmap development process: Creating smart grid roadmaps to meet regional technology planning needs in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12999601","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6304306/","conferenceDate":"29 July-2 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated technology roadmap development process: Creating smart grid roadmaps to meet regional technology planning needs in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"29012R0586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079443S","chronDate":"July 29 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6296788","isNumber":"6304012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6296788","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6304012","articleId":"6304306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET (Portland Intl conf on Manage","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6304641,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory F.

To encrypt/decrypt a file using the AES algorithm, the file must undergo a set of complex computational steps. Therefore a software implementation of AES algorithm would be slow and consume large amount of time to complete. The immense increase of both stored and transferred data in the recent years had made this problem even more daunting when the need to encrypt/decrypt such data arises. As a solution to this problem, in this paper, we present an extensive study of enhancing the throughput of AES encryption algorithm by utilizing the state of the art multicore architectures. We take a sequential program that implements the AES algorithm and convert the same to run on multicore architectures with minimum effort. We implement two different parallel programmes, one with the fork system call in Linux and the other with the pthreads, the POSIX standard for threads. Later, we ran both the versions of the parallel programs on different multicore architectures and compared and analysed the throughputs between the implementations and among different architectures. The pthreads implementation outperformed in all the experiments we conducted and the best throughput obtained is around 7Gbps on a 32-core processor (the largest number of cores we had) with the pthreads implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the throughput of the AES algorithm with multicore processors","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 7th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)","doi":"10.1109/ICIInfS.2012.6304791","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 7th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294525/6304761/06304791.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIInfS.2012.6304791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6304761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving the throughput of the AES algorithm with multicore processors","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6304791/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12998682","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the throughput of the AES algorithm with multicore processors","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045675S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294525","isNumber":"6304761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294525","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6304761","articleId":"6304791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6304792,"authors":[{"name":"Sawata R.

This requires reliable detection of incumbent primary users at sufficiently low SNR. But sensing OFDM signals is particularly challenging as any inherent cyclostationarity is destroyed due to orthogonality of sub-carriers. Induced cyclostationarity can be used to introduce a controlled correlation in the message signal and produce cyclostationary features that can aid spectrum sensing. This paper derives an optimum maximum likelihood test statistic from first principles for detection of a cyclic prefixed OFDM (CP-OFDM) signal with induced cyclostationarity. It adopts a vector matrix model for the CP-OFDM signal in the AWGN scenario and empirically evaluates the detection probability through a Neyman-Pearson test. Simulation results show that a higher probability of detection can be achieved by using the proposed optimum detector for induced cyclostationarity as compared to energy detection and simple cyclic prefix detection. Also the performance scales with number of subcarriers and induced correlation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIInfS.2012.6304804","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 7th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 7th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6294525/6304761/06304804.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIInfS.2012.6304804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6304761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of optimum detector for cyclic prefixed OFDM with induced cyclostationarity for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304804/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optimum detector for cyclic prefixed OFDM with induced cyclostationarity for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12998694","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6304804/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optimum detector for cyclic prefixed OFDM with induced cyclostationarity for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055488S","chronDate":"6-9 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6294525","isNumber":"6304761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6294525","xplore-issue":"6304761","articleId":"6304804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6304904,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Moser","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Electronic, Electrical, and Naval Engineering (DITEN), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6461951/6304904/6304904-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriele Moser (Member, IEEE) received the Laurea degree (M.Sc. equivalent; summa cum laude) in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in space sciences and engineering from the University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","Since 2010, he has been an Assistant Professor of Telecommunications at the University of Genoa.

In this framework, the main ideas and previous work about Markov modeling for VHR image classification will be recalled in this paper and processing results obtained through recent methods proposed by the authors will be discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Land-Cover Mapping by Markov Modeling of Spatial\u2013Contextual Information in Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2211551","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6461951/06304904.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2211551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304904","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Land-Cover Mapping by Markov Modeling of Spatial\u2013Contextual Information in Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"101","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6304904/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13324014","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Land-Cover Mapping by Markov Modeling of Spatial\u2013Contextual Information in Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"jproc-serpico-2211551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164817S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6461951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"6461951","articleId":"6304904","onlineDate":"17 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6304905,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Dadkhah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6841675/6304905/dadkh-2219143-small.gif","p":["Mohammadreza Dadkhah (S'10) was born in 1982, Isfahan, Iran.

The conventional three-transistor active pixel sensor (APS) structure and switched capacitor circuits are exploited to develop an analog implementation of the CS encoding in a CMOS sensor. With the analog implementation, the sensing and encoding are performed in the same time interval and making a real-time encoding process to optimize the frame rate of the imager. A block readout strategy is proposed to capture the required CS measurements for different blocks of the image, rather than the common column-row readout method. All measurement circuits are placed outside the array by this readout strategy, and the imager becomes scalable for larger array sizes. Because there is no extra in-pixel element for the CS measurement process, the fill factor of the imager is the same as its corresponding APS imager without CS. The proposed structure is designed and fabricated in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS technology for a 2 \u00d7 2 array. The experimental results confirm the validity of the design in making monotonic and appropriate CS measurements. The functionality of the block readout method and the scalability of the imager are confirmed by fabrication of a 4\u00d74 block and a 16\u00d716 array.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Based CS in a CMOS Image Sensor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2219143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6841675/06304905.pdf","startPage":"2897","endPage":"2909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2219143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6841675","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Block-Based CS in a CMOS Image Sensor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6304905/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14428022","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Canada Research Chair Program"},{"fundingName":"ITCE Division, POSTECH by hosting him as a Distinguished Visiting Professor through the S.

Magnetic dipoles placed over the top layer of the PCB are introduced as the equivalent of actual radiated sources. A restarted optimization procedure based on a differential evolution algorithm is developed to determine the parameters of the dipoles (number, position, and moment components) via minimizing the difference between the measured magnetic near field and that radiated by the dipoles. These equivalent dipoles can be used to predict the radiated emissions of the PCB once being determined. The proposed approach does not need the phase of the measured near fields, and its computational complexity is very low.

Such surveys are conducted with side-looking sonar sensors whose performance is dependent on environmental, target, sensor, and AUV platform parameters. It is difficult to obtain precise knowledge of all of these parameters to be able to design optimal mission plans offline. This research represents the first known sensor driven online approach to seabed coverage for MCM. A method is presented where paths are planned using a multiobjective optimization. Information theory is combined with a new concept coined branch entropy based on a hexagonal cell decomposition. The result is a planning algorithm that not only produces shorter paths than conventional means, but is also capable of accounting for environmental factors detected in situ. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and in water trials conducted on the IVER2 AUV show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sonar","Entropy","Linear programming","Path planning","Robot sensing systems","Underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","entropy","optimisation","path planning","sensors","sonar target recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor-driven online coverage planning","autonomous underwater vehicle mine countermeasure surveys","AUV MCM","seabed coverage","multiobjective optimization","information theory","branch entropy","hexagonal cell decomposition","path planning algorithm","environmental factors","hardware-in-the-loop simulation","IVER2 AUV","sidescan sonar sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive mission planning","autonomous underwater vehicles","coverage path planning","hardware in the loop (HWIL)","information gain","mine countermeasure (MCM)","sidescan sonar (SSS)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2213607","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6681918/06304931.pdf","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2213607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor-Driven Online Coverage Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensor-Driven Online Coverage Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304931/","volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6304931/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13969629","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor-Driven Online Coverage Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tmech-li-2213607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082937S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6681918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6681918","articleId":"6304931","onlineDate":"17 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6304936,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Vitiello","affiliation":["BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore SantAnna, Pontedera, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6428720/6304936/6304936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Vitiello (M\u201912) received the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering (cum laude) from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2006, and from Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, in 2007.

The design of NEUROExos focused on three solutions that enable its use for poststroke physical rehabilitation. First, double-shelled links allow an ergonomic physical human-robot interface and, consequently, a comfortable interaction. Second, a four-degree-of-freedom passive mechanism, embedded in the link, allows the user's elbow and robot axes to be constantly aligned during movement. The robot axis can passively rotate on the frontal and horizontal planes 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0, respectively, and translate on the horizontal plane 30 mm. Finally, a variable impedance antagonistic actuation system allows NEUROExos to be controlled with two alternative strategies: independent control of the joint position and stiffness, for robot-in-charge rehabilitation mode, and near-zero impedance torque control, for patient-in-charge rehabilitation mode. In robot-in-charge mode, the passive joint stiffness can be changed in the range of 24-56 N\u00b7m/rad. In patient-in-charge mode, NEUROExos output impedance ranges from 1 N\u00b7m/rad, for 0.3 Hz motion, to 10 N\u00b7m/rad, for 3.2 Hz motion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NEUROExos: A Powered Elbow Exoskeleton for Physical Rehabilitation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2012.2211492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6428720/06304936.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2012.2211492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6304936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"NEUROExos: A Powered Elbow Exoskeleton for Physical Rehabilitation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6304936/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13270782","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NEUROExos: A Powered Elbow Exoskeleton for Physical Rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"tro-vitiello-2211492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186792S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6428720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"6428720","articleId":"6304936","onlineDate":"17 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6304940,"authors":[{"name":"Shou-Hsien Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6341879/6304940/6304940-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shou-Hsien Weng (S'08) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1984.

This MPC approach stands out because, when a long enough prediction horizon is used, the saturation of the ES system (ESS) can be advanced by means of a prediction model of the PV panels production. Therefore, the PV+ES power plant can modify its production so as to manage the power deviations with regard to that committed in the daily and intraday electricity markets, with the objective of reducing economic penalties. The initial power commitment is supposed in this work to be given by a higher level energy management operator. By a proper definition of its objective function, the predictive control allows us to economically optimize the PV+ES power plant performance.

Development of novel biomedical technologies is an urgent necessity to improve diagnostic services for this demographic. Electrocar diogram (ECG) and temperature recording have been used for more than 50 years in medical diagnosis to understand various biological activities [1], [2]. A more recent development, electronic pill technology, requires the integration of more complex systems on the same platform when compared to conventional implantable systems. A small miniaturized electronic pill can reach areas such as the small intestine and can deliver real time video images wirelessly to an external console. Figure 1 shows an electronic pill system (i.e., wireless endoscopy) for a medical monitoring system. The device travels through the digestive system to collect image data and transfers the data to a nearby computer for display with a distance of one meter or more. A high resolution videobased capsule endoscope produces a large amount of data, which can then be delivered over a high-capacity wireless link.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2012.2205833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6304953","startPage":"90","endPage":"101","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/6304953/06304996.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2012.2205833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Easy-to-Swallow Wireless Telemetry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemetry","Wireless communication","Aging","Sociology","Medical services","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biomedical optical imaging","biomedical telemetry","computer vision","endoscopes","patient monitoring","radio links","radiotelemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["easy-to-swallow wireless telemetry","aging population","healthcare facilities","biomedical technology","medical diagnostic services","demography","electrocardiogram","ECG","temperature recording","biological activities","conventional implantable systems","small miniaturized electronic pill technology","small intestine","video images","external console","wireless endoscopy","medical monitoring system","digestive system","image data collection","high resolution videobased capsule endoscope","high-capacity wireless link"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Easy-to-Swallow Wireless Telemetry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6304996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 September 2012","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6304996/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12999175","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Easy-to-Swallow Wireless Telemetry","sourcePdf":"13mmm06-yuce-2205833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088489S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"6304953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6304953","articleId":"6304996","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6305002,"authors":[{"name":"Sherif Sayed Ahmed","affiliation":["Rohde \u2026 Schwarz GmbH \u2026 Co.

This paper considers a system scenario relevant to such applications, where a smart-phone acts as a data-collecting hub, gathering data from a number of wireless-capable body sensors, and relaying them to a healthcare provider host through standard existing cellular networks. Delay of critical data and sensors' energy efficiency are both relevant and conflicting issues. Therefore, it is important to operate the wireless body-area sensor network at some desired point close to the optimal energy-delay tradeoff curve. This tradeoff curve is a function of the employed physical-layer protocol: in particular, it depends on the multiple-access scheme and on the coding and modulation schemes available. In this work, we consider a protocol closely inspired by the widely-used Bluetooth standard. First, we consider the calculation of the minimum energy function, i.e., the minimum sum energy per symbol that guarantees the stability of all transmission queues in the network. Then, we apply the general theory developed by Neely to develop a dynamic scheduling policy that approaches the optimal energy-delay tradeoff for the network at hand. Finally, we examine the queue dynamics and propose a novel policy that adaptively switches between connected and disconnected (sleeping) modes. We demonstrate that the proposed policy can achieve significant gains in the realistic case where the control \"NULL\" packets necessary to maintain the connection alive, have a non-zero energy cost, and the data arrival statistics corresponding to the sensed physical process are bursty.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.12.110143A","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6305023/06305027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.12.110143A","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305023","startPage":"2733","endPage":"2746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Delay Tradeoff and Dynamic Sleep Switching for Bluetooth-Like Body-Area Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Delay Tradeoff and Dynamic Sleep Switching for Bluetooth-Like Body-Area Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12998980","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305027/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Delay Tradeoff and Dynamic Sleep Switching for Bluetooth-Like Body-Area Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"2733-tc1209-rebeiz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079588S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6305023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6305023","articleId":"6305027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6305069,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["School of business and management, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37557598900"},{"name":"Kin Keung Lai","affiliation":["Department of Management Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kin Keung","lastName":"Lai","id":"37292495700"},{"name":"Dongxiao Niu","affiliation":["School of business and management, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongxiao","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409787800"},{"name":"Qian Zhang","affiliation":["School of business and management, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37401708000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2092-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4750-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305069","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305069","abstract":"For most credit risk assessment models, decision attributes and history data are of great importance in terms of accuracy of prediction. Decision attributes can be classified into two types: numerical and categorical. As these two types have different characteristics, there will be interference if they are used simultaneously in the same model. By applying the case based reasoning (CBR) and artificial neural network (ANN), this study attempts to use numerical and categorical attributes separately in different phases application of the model. For example, if numerical attributes are used in CBR to select similar cases, categorical attributes will be used as inputs of an ANN based on the cases selected. Therefore, interference caused by the different types of attributes is avoided and the accuracy is improved. As only similar history data are selected and input in the ANN, accuracy is improved further. With the idea above, a triple ANN-CBR model is designed in this paper. This model synthesizes advantages of CBR and ANN. Practical examples show that the model established in this paper is feasible and effective. Compared with other models, it has a better precision performance.","doi":"10.1109/BIFE.2012.11","startPage":"10","endPage":"14","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305055/6305056/06305069.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIFE.2012.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Triple Artificial Neural Network Model Based on Case Based Reasoning for Credit Risk Assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Numerical models","Accuracy","Support vector machines","Predictive models","History","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","credit transactions","decision making","neural nets","pattern classification","risk analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case based reasoning","credit risk assessment","decision attribute classification","artificial neural network","ANN","numerical attributes","categorical attributes","CBR","interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural network","case based reasoning","credit assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Triple Artificial Neural Network Model Based on Case Based Reasoning for Credit Risk Assessment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6305069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13000689","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Triple Artificial Neural Network Model Based on Case Based Reasoning for Credit Risk Assessment","confLoc":"Lanzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4750a010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096676S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305055","isNumber":"6305056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305055","xplore-issue":"6305056","articleId":"6305069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6305070,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37713846400"},{"name":"Ming Xiao","affiliation":["Network Center, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37711125500"},{"name":"Fuzhe Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Fuzhe","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37595450400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2092-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4750-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305070","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Predictive models","Neural networks","Data models","Adaptation models","Forecasting","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial data processing","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial returns","adaptive particle swarm optimization","financial investment","noise data","volatile data","Elman network","generalized regression neural network","GRNN","wavelet neural network","WNN","improved particle swarm optimization","IPSO","arccosine function","support vector machines","SVM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","particle swarm optimization","stock indices","nonlinear ensemble forecasting"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIFE.2012.143","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305055/6305056/06305070.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","startPage":"15","endPage":"19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIFE.2012.143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Financial Returns Using Neural Networks and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"For financial investment, the problem that we often encounter is how to extract information hidden in the volatile and noise data and forecast it into future. This study proposes a novel three-stage neural-network-based nonlinear weighted ensemble model. In proposed model, three different types neural-network base models, i.e., Elman network, generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and wavelet neural network (WNN) are generated by three non-overlapping training sets, further, they are optimized by improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) with adaptive nonlinear inertia weight and dynamic arccosine function acceleration parameters. Finally, a neural-network-based nonlinear weighted meta-model be produced by learning three neural-network base models through support vector machines (SVM) neural network. The superiority of the proposed approach is due to its flexibility to account for potentially complex nonlinear relationships that are not easily captured by single or linear models. Empirical results suggest that the novel ensemble model generally produces forecasts which, on the basis of out-of-sample forecast encompassing tests and comparisons of four different statistic measures, routinely dominate the forecasts from single modeling and linear modeling approach with two daily stock indices time series processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305070/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13013307","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6305070/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Financial Returns Using Neural Networks and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Financial Returns Using Neural Networks and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Lanzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4750a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047614S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305055","isNumber":"6305056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305055","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6305056","articleId":"6305070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6305171,"authors":[{"name":"Saiyan Cheng","affiliation":["School of Management, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Saiyan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38468897700"},{"name":"Lei Ding","affiliation":["School of Management, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Ding","id":"38483207500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2092-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4750-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305171","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305171","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic government","Bibliometrics","Visualization","Security","Market research","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["government data processing","groupware","information analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic government","SCI journal","SSCI journals","bibliometrics analysis software","CiteSpace II","scientific literature","time-zone views","cluster views","e-government cross-sectoral collaboration ability","security infrastructure design","digital government"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electronic government","CiteSpace II","Research fronts","Visualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIFE.2012.108","publicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305055/6305056/06305171.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIFE.2012.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quantitative Study on the Research Fronts of Electronic Government","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the volume of research output on the topic of electronic government.

A pulse generator and a 500 um-diameter magnetic coil were used to inject the localized EMP disturbances without any physical contact with the target. EMP injections were performed against a software AES running on a CPU, and a hardware AES (with and without countermeasure) embedded in a FPGA. The purpose of this work was twofold: (a) reporting actual faults injection induced by EMPs in our targets and describing their main properties, (b) explaining the coupling mechanism between the antenna used to produce the EMP and the targeted circuit, which causes the faults. The obtained results revealed a localized effect of the EMP since the injected faults were found dependent on the spatial position of the antenna on top of the circuit's surface. The assumption that EMP faults are related to the violation of the target's timing constraints was also studied and ascertained thanks to the use of a countermeasure based on monitoring such timing violations.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2012.15","publicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305022/6305209/06305224.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2012.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic Transient Faults Injection on a Hardware and a Software Implementations of AES","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Transient Faults Injection on a Hardware and a Software Implementations of AES","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13000501","htmlLink":"/document/6305224/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Transient Faults Injection on a Hardware and a Software Implementations of AES","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"4834a007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126256S","chronDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305022","isNumber":"6305209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305022","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6305209","articleId":"6305224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6305225,"authors":[{"name":"Takeshi Sugawara","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Sugawara","id":"37529284400"},{"name":"Daisuke Suzuki","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37313956200"},{"name":"Toshihiro Katashita","affiliation":["Research Institute for Secure Systems, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Katashita","id":"37300316600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2900-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305225","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Timing","Analytical models","Data models","Fluid flow measurement","Histograms","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","cryptography","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit noise","large scale integration","logic circuits","logic simulation","network routing","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault sensitivity analysis","cryptographic LSI design flow","circuit simulation method","FSA","security evaluation","leak mechanism investigation","fault sensitivity data extraction","post place-and-route logic simulation","AES implementation","SASEBO LSI","key recovery attack","timing jitter","noise measurement","size 130 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Sensitivity Analysis","Circuit Simulation","Side-channel attacks","Fault injection attacks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305225","abstract":"Circuit simulation method for Fault Sensitivity Analysis (FSA) is proposed.

We consider more practical fault models, we obtain improved key recovery algorithms and we present more attack paths for combined attacks on AES. We propose to inject faults on the different operations of the key schedule instead of the key state of round 9 or the corresponding data state. We also consider fault injections in AES constants such as the RCon or the affine transformation of the SubWord. By corrupting these constants, the attacker can easily deduce the value of the error. The key recovery complexity can then be greatly improved. Notably, we can obtain a complexity identical to a classical differential side-channel attack.

Our results show that injecting biased faults allows an attacker to reveal security-critical data with significantly fewer faults and/or a significantly faster search through the remaining candidates.","publicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305022/6305209/06305231.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harnessing Biased Faults in Attacks on ECC-Based Signature Schemes","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2012.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2012.13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Harnessing Biased Faults in Attacks on ECC-Based Signature Schemes","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13000508","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305231/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harnessing Biased Faults in Attacks on ECC-Based Signature Schemes","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"4834a072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122293S","chronDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305022","isNumber":"6305209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305022","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6305209","articleId":"6305231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6305232,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Lomn\u00e9","affiliation":["ANSSI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lomn\u00e9","id":"37391632100"},{"name":"Thomas Roche","affiliation":["ANSSI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Roche","id":"37741162500"},{"name":"Adrian Thillard","affiliation":["ANSSI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Thillard","id":"38481106400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2900-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305232","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":744},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305232","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doped fiber amplifiers","Encryption","Robustness","Resistance","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault attack countermeasure","AES","advanced encryption standard","symmetric ciphers","fault attacks","block cipher","side channel attack","higher order masking","infection countermeasures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","Fault Attack","Side-Channel Analysis","Combined Attack","Fault Attack Countermeasures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2012.19","publicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305022/6305209/06305232.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2012.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Need of Randomness in Fault Attack Countermeasures - Application to AES","abstract":"Recent works show that a combination of perturbation and observation attacks on symmetric ciphers thwarts state-of-the-art countermeasures. In this paper, we first propose a new way - to our knowledge - to classify fault attacks against block ciphers, allowing us to exhibit their capacity to be combined with observation attacks. We then present a set of common protections against side-channel and fault attacks, namely higher-order masking schemes, detection and infection countermeasures, and how they can be combined. We show that the combination of a higher-order masking scheme and a detection countermeasure can actually be defeated by a slight variant of the combined attack of Roche et al., even if one applies their patch. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that none of the published infection countermeasures is robust against fault attacks. Finally, using randomness, we propose a set of enhanced countermeasures that thwart considered threats.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305232/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13000509","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the Need of Randomness in Fault Attack Countermeasures - Application to AES","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Need of Randomness in Fault Attack Countermeasures - Application to AES","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"4834a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097627S","chronDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305022","isNumber":"6305209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305022","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6305209","articleId":"6305232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6305233,"authors":[{"name":"Sho Endo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Sho","lastName":"Endo","id":"38481734100"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37405722200"},{"name":"Naofumi Homma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Naofumi","lastName":"Homma","id":"37277542900"},{"name":"Kazuo Sakiyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Sakiyama","id":"37281944700"},{"name":"Kazuo Ohta","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Ohta","id":"37308402000"},{"name":"Takafumi Aoki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Aoki","id":"37278927700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2900-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305233","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Cryptography","Clocks","Circuit faults","Sensitivity","Doped fiber amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault sensitivity analysis","configurable delay blocks","FSA attack","CDB","fault attack","secret information","cryptographic modules","differential fault analysis","DFA attack","redundancy calculation","masked AND-OR","wave dynamic differential logic","WDDL","setup time violation fault","Li countermeasure concept","post-manufacture configuration","overhead minimization","hardware overhead","ASIC","AES module","prototype FPGA implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Sensitivity Analysis","Countermeasures","Configurable delay block","AES"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Countermeasure against Fault Sensitivity Analysis Using Configurable Delay Blocks","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2012.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305209","endPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305022/6305209/06305233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2012.12","startPage":"95","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305233","abstract":"In this paper, we present an efficient countermeasure against Fault Sensitivity Analysis (FSA) based on a configurable delay blocks (CDBs). FSA is a new type of fault attack which exploits the relationship between fault sensitivity and secret information. Previous studies reported that it could break cryptographic modules equipped with conventional countermeasures against Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) such as redundancy calculation, Masked AND-OR and Wave Dynamic Differential Logic (WDDL). The proposed countermeasure can detect both DFA and FSA attacks based on setup time violation faults. The proposed ideas are to use a CDB as a time base for detection and to combine the technique with Li's countermeasure concept which removes the dependency between fault sensitivities and secret data. Post-manufacture configuration of the delay blocks allows minimization of the overhead in operating frequency which comes from manufacture variability. In this paper, we present an implementation of the proposed countermeasure, and describe its configuration method. We also investigate the hardware overhead of the proposed countermeasure implemented in ASIC for an AES module and demonstrate its validity through an experiment using a prototype FPGA implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13000510","htmlLink":"/document/6305233/","conferenceDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Countermeasure against Fault Sensitivity Analysis Using Configurable Delay Blocks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Countermeasure against Fault Sensitivity Analysis Using Configurable Delay Blocks","confLoc":"Leuven, Belgium","sourcePdf":"4834a095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049307S","chronDate":"9-9 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305022","isNumber":"6305209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305022","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6305209","articleId":"6305233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6305263,"authors":[{"name":"Ismaeel Al Ridhawi","affiliation":["University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine, Ottawa, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Ismaeel Al","lastName":"Ridhawi"},{"name":"Nancy Samaan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Samaan","id":"37300650600"},{"name":"Ahmed Karmouch","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Karmouch","id":"37270085000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2001-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4737-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305263","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","profitability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulator-assisted joint service-level-agreement","vertical-handover adaptation","profit maximization","SLA","mobile users","vertical-handover operations","multitechnology wireless environments","optimal VHO configuration","handover initiation","network selection","service provider monetary profit","VHO scheme","policy-based real-time simulator","system adaptability","performance evaluation results"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless network mobility","vertical-handover","service-level-agreements","policy-based management","run-time simulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel paradigm to jointly fine-tune service-level-agreements (SLAs) offered to mobile users and adapt accompanied vertical-handover (VHO) operations in future multi-technology wireless environments. In contrast to existing, statically configured, VHO schemes that lack the ability to quickly adapt to changing network loads, the proposed framework continuously derives optimal VHO configuration policies with respect to handover initiation and network selection. In addition, the proposed work reconfigures the newly created SLA instances offered to the new users according to network conditions with the objective of maximizing the service provider monetary profit. To achieve these goals, we derive a new model for VHO-based SLA that incorporates service guarantees during the transient phase of the VHO operation. Next, we present a generic model for the control and adaptation of any VHO scheme through the adoption of various types of policies. These models are incorporated in a novel architecture that relies on a policy-based real-time simulator as its core component for system adaptability. Performance evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAINT.2012.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305234","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/IPSJ 12th International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/IPSJ 12th International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305029/6305234/06305263.pdf","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulator-Assisted Joint Service-Level-Agreement and Vertical-Handover Adaptation for Profit Maximization","doi":"10.1109/SAINT.2012.19","startPage":"74","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Simulator-Assisted Joint Service-Level-Agreement and Vertical-Handover Adaptation for Profit Maximization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305263/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13000521","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305263/","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulator-Assisted Joint Service-Level-Agreement and Vertical-Handover Adaptation for Profit Maximization","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4737a074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053472S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305029","isNumber":"6305234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305029","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6305234","articleId":"6305263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6305297,"authors":[{"name":"Masaaki Sato","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Sato","id":"38475552700"},{"name":"Hirofumi Yamaki","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Yamaki","id":"37839251100"},{"name":"Hiroki Takakura","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Takakura","id":"37063537900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2001-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4737-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305297","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Testing","Training data","Educational institutions","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","feature extraction","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unknown attacks detection","feature extraction","anomaly-based IDS alerts","computer systems","signature-based intrusion detection systems","anomaly-based intrusion detection systems","signature-based IDS","network traffic","IDS operators","Kyoto2006+ dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intrusion detection system","anomaly detection","unknown attacks"]}],"abstract":"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play an important role detecting various kinds of attacks and defend our computer systems from them. There are basically two main types of detection techniques: signature-based and anomaly-based. A signature-based IDS cannot detect unknown attacks because a signature has not been written. To overcome this shortcoming, many researchers have been developing anomaly-based IDSs. Although they can detect unknown attacks, there is a problem that they just classify network traffic into normal or abnormal. Therefore, IDS operators have to manually inspect IDS alerts to classify them into known attacks or unknown attacks. Because there are a lot of alerts related to known attacks, it is difficult to extract only unknown attacks from them. In this paper, we present a method that automatically detects unknown attacks from an anomaly-based IDS alerts.

To address the DoS attack problem, we propose an anomaly-based detection system using the Tanimoto distance to identify deviations in the traffic. We use a modified moving average approach to select a threshold. We also propose using a momentum oscillator to detect a slightly increasing attack.

This work proposes a multivariate sampling algorithm based on component analysis techniques in wireless sensor networks. To improve the sampling, the algorithm uses component analysis techniques to rank the data. Once ranked, the most representative data is retained. Simulation results show that our technique reduces the data keeping its representativeness. In addition, the energy consumption and delay to deliver the data on the network are reduced.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Temperature measurement","Temperature sensors","Indexes","Humidity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","sampling methods","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MuSA","multivariate sampling algorithm","wireless sensor networks","process environmental data","multivariate nature","component analysis techniques","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor network","multivariate sampling","component analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6774900/06305448.pdf","startPage":"968","endPage":"978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MuSA: Multivariate Sampling Algorithmfor Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MuSA: Multivariate Sampling Algorithmfor Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305448/","volume":"63","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6305448/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14180419","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MuSA: Multivariate Sampling Algorithmfor Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tc-aquin-229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082128S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6774900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6774900","articleId":"6305448","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6305453,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Tawfik","affiliation":["Departamento de El\u00e9ctrica, Electr\u00f3nica y Control Industrial (DIEEC), Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenieros Industriales (ETSII), Universidad Nacional de educaci\u00f3n a Distancia, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/6478748/6305453/6305453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Tawfik received the BSc degree in electrical engineering from the Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, and the MSc degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Spanish University for Distance Education (UNED), Madrid, Spain, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

VISIR allows wiring and measuring of electronic circuits remotely on a virtual workbench that replicates physical circuit breadboards. The wiring mechanism is developed by means of a relay switching matrix connected to a PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) instrumentation platform. The entire equipment is controlled by LabVIEW server software, in addition to a measurement server software that protects the equipment from hazard connections by verifying input circuit designs, sent by students, before being executed. This paper addresses other approaches such as remote labs based on Data Acquisition Cards (DAQs), NetLab, and RemotElectLab, comparing them with VISIR in order to emphasize its singularity. Topics discussed are as follows: the technical description, software, operation cycle, features, and provided services. In addition, the feedback received by students at several universities and the encountered drawbacks along with the proposed solutions are highlighted. The paper finally addresses the ongoing and future challenges within the VISIR community including its integration with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and iLab Shared Architecture (ISA), its new hardware version release that is based on LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI), and its new open platform version that supports federated access.","doi":"10.1109/TLT.2012.20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620076/6478748/06305453.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2012.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR) for Remote Wiring and Measurement of Electronic Circuits on Breadboard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR) for Remote Wiring and Measurement of Electronic Circuits on Breadboard","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305453/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13382470","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6305453/","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR) for Remote Wiring and Measurement of Electronic Circuits on Breadboard","sourcePdf":"tlt2013010060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128114S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"6478748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6478748","articleId":"6305453","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":6305455,"authors":[{"name":"Changyu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Changyu","lastName":"Lin","id":"38490077900"},{"name":"Ivan B.

The performance of proposed coded-modulation scheme is evaluated for different number of spatial modes. The simulation results indicate that the MDL is the predominant effect in the long-haul optical transmission based on FMFs. Different pilot-aided OFDM based compensation methods are studied, and it has been found that minimum mean-square estimation with linear interpolation method is the most robust against mode coupling and MDL. We also show that the nonbinary LDPC-coded modulation provides about 1 dB improvement over binary LDPC-coded modulation (16 QAM OFDM and MDL of 25 dB). Finally, we study the degradation of increasing the number of modes and investigate the proposed scheme for different MDL values in both fourand eight-mode fibers.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2012.2219515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2012.2219515","startPage":"1922","endPage":"1929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563994/6244834/06305455.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6244834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC-Coded Mode-Multiplexed Coherent Optical OFDM 1.28-Tbit/s 16-QAM Signal Transmission Over 2000 km of Few-Mode Fibers With Mode-Dependent Loss","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC-Coded Mode-Multiplexed Coherent Optical OFDM 1.28-Tbit/s 16-QAM Signal Transmission Over 2000 km of Few-Mode Fibers With Mode-Dependent Loss","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13032782","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305455/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Nonbinary LDPC-Coded Mode-Multiplexed Coherent Optical OFDM 1.28-Tbit/s 16-QAM Signal Transmission Over 2000 km of Few-Mode Fibers With Mode-Dependent Loss","sourcePdf":"jphot-lin-2219515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04777S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6244834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6244834","articleId":"6305455","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6305459,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37336431600"},{"name":"Zhongxiang Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhongxiang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37273304700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6305459","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1459},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter describes a miniaturized bandstop frequency-selective structure (FSS) based on the stepped-impedance resonator (SIR). The FSS consists of a two-dimensional periodic array of vertical microstrip SIRs for thickness reduction. A shunt capacitor connecting the SIR center and ground is employed to widen the operating bandwidth and to improve the quasi-elliptic filtering response. It is shown that more than 40% thickness reduction of the FSS can be realized by choosing a small impedance ratio of the SIR, and a steep quasi-elliptic bandstop filtering performance is achieved by adjusting the value of the shunt capacitor. As an example, a prototype of the proposed FSS is designed, fabricated, and tested. The good agreement between simulated and measured results verifies the design concept of the miniaturized FSS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06305459.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2219571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2219571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized Bandstop Frequency-Selective Structure Using Stepped-Impedance Resonators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Resonant frequency","Microstrip","Capacitors","Bandwidth","Arrays","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-stop filters","frequency selective surfaces","microstrip resonators","resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniaturized bandstop frequency selective structure","stepped impedance resonators","vertical microstrip SIR","2D periodic array","thickness reduction","shunt capacitor","quasielliptic filtering response","impedance ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-selective structure (FSS)","elliptic response","miniaturization","stepped-impedance resonator (SIR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized Bandstop Frequency-Selective Structure Using Stepped-Impedance Resonators","volume":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6305459/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2012","accessionNumber":"13032773","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized Bandstop Frequency-Selective Structure Using Stepped-Impedance Resonators","sourcePdf":"lawp-shen-2219571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045115S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6305459","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6305464,"authors":[{"name":"Chiong Ching Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6359939/6305464/6305464-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chiong Ching Lai received his B.E.

It can also be desirable if the beampattern of the beamformer is invariant to the look direction. A number of design methods for such beamformers, based on the spherical harmonic transform, have been reported in the literature. However, these methods require the sensor positions to satisfy a certain condition which may conflict with practical considerations. This paper proposes a design method which obviates this restriction thus allowing for spherical arrays with arbitrary sensor configurations. Moreover, for a comparable level of performance and computational complexity to the existing spherical harmonic beamformers, the proposed beamformer requires fewer sensors. The trade-off is that the design of the beamformer now depends on the sensor positions. Other considerations, such as the effects of array mis-orientation and robustness, are also discussed in this paper and illustrated by design examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2219527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359939","startPage":"427","endPage":"438","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6359939/06305464.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Steerable Spherical Broadband Beamformers With Flexible Sensor Configurations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305464/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of Steerable Spherical Broadband Beamformers With Flexible Sensor Configurations","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13186408","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Steerable Spherical Broadband Beamformers With Flexible Sensor Configurations","sourcePdf":"tasl-lai-2219527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076356S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6359939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6359939","articleId":"6305464","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6305465,"authors":[{"name":"Sridhar Krishna Nemala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Language and Speech Processing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6359939/6305465/6305465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sridhar Krishna Nemala received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2012.

These parallel streams are organized around a duality of slow vs. fast: Coarse signal dynamics appear to be processed separately from rapidly changing modulations both in the spectral and temporal dimensions. We adapt such duality in a multistream framework for robust speaker-independent phoneme recognition. The scheme presented here centers around a multi-path bandpass modulation analysis of speech sounds with each stream covering an entire range of temporal and spectral modulations. By performing bandpass operations along the spectral and temporal dimensions, the proposed scheme avoids the classic feature explosion problem of previous multistream approaches while maintaining the advantage of parallelism and localized feature analysis. The proposed architecture results in substantial improvements over standard and state-of-the-art feature schemes for phoneme recognition, particularly in presence of nonstationary noise, reverberation and channel distortions.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6359939/06305465.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multistream Feature Framework Based on Bandpass Modulation Filtering for Robust Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2219526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2219526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Multistream Feature Framework Based on Bandpass Modulation Filtering for Robust Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13186409","pubMedId":"29928166","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6305465/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multistream Feature Framework Based on Bandpass Modulation Filtering for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-nemala-2219526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109002S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6359939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6359939","articleId":"6305465","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6305471,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Moser","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Electronic, Electrical, and Naval Eng.

In this paper, a novel and rigorous framework, which integrates SVMs and Markov random field models in a unique formulation for spatial contextual classification, is proposed. The developed contextual generalization of SVMs, is obtained by analytically relating the Markovian minimum-energy criterion to the application of an SVM in a suitably transformed space. Furthermore, as a second contribution, a novel contextual classifier is developed in the proposed general framework. Two specific algorithms, based on the Ho\u2013Kashyap and Powell numerical procedures, are combined with this classifier to automate the estimation of its parameters.

The control laws proposed are categorized into two envelopes by integrating individual path tracking and global virtual structure approaches. One is steering individual vehicles to track virtual vehicles moving along predefined paths, generated by a formation reference vehicle (FRV) of a time-varying desired virtual structure. The other is ensuring paths to be well tracked in order to build a geometric formation, through the distributed feedback law for path parameters related to the virtual vehicles, such that the physical vehicles are on the desired placements of the formation structure. Within this framework, geometric path tracking is achieved via nonlinear control theory, where an approaching angle is injected as a heading guidance design. The distributed feedback law is analyzed under communication constraints using algebraic graph theory. It is formally shown that the path tracking error of each vehicle is reduced to zero, and vehicles in the networked team globally asymptotically converge to a desired formation with equal path parameters. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6387656/06305472.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2219541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2219541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387656","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Control of Coordinated Path Tracking for Networked Nonholonomic Mobile Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Vectors","Mobile communication","Vehicle dynamics","Control design","Wheels","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","distributed control","feedback","geometry","mobile robots","position control","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","coordinated path tracking","networked nonholonomic mobile vehicles","global virtual structure approaches","virtual vehicles","formation reference vehicle","time-varying desired virtual structure","FRV","geometric path tracking","distributed feedback law","control design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated path tracking","distributed control","formation reference vehicle","nonholonomic mobile vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Control of Coordinated Path Tracking for Networked Nonholonomic Mobile Vehicles","volume":"9","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6305472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188421","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Control of Coordinated Path Tracking for Networked Nonholonomic Mobile Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tii-xiang-2219541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115213S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6387656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6387656","articleId":"6305472","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6305473,"authors":[{"name":"Lixian Zhang","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6387656/6305473/6305473-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lixian Zhang (M'10) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2006.","From January 2007 to September 2008, he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, QC, Canada.

The tradeoff weighted fuzzy factor depends on the space distance of all neighboring pixels and their gray-level difference simultaneously. By using this factor, the new algorithm can accurately estimate the damping extent of neighboring pixels. In order to further enhance its robustness to noise and outliers, we introduce a kernel distance measure to its objective function. The new algorithm adaptively determines the kernel parameter by using a fast bandwidth selection rule based on the distance variance of all data points in the collection. Furthermore, the tradeoff weighted fuzzy factor and the kernel distance measure are both parameter free. Experimental results on synthetic and real images show that the new algorithm is effective and efficient, and is relatively independent of this type of noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6407512/06305476.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2219547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2219547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6407512","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy C-Means Clustering With Local Information and Kernel Metric for Image Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Clustering algorithms","Noise","Image segmentation","Noise measurement","Damping","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","image segmentation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved fuzzy C-mean clustering algorithm","local information","image segmentation","improved FCM algorithm","weighted fuzzy factor","gray-level difference","kernel distance measure","kernel metric","neighboring pixels","damping extent estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy clustering","gray-level constraint","image segmentation","kernel metric","spatial constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy C-Means Clustering With Local Information and Kernel Metric for Image Segmentation","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6305476/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219161","pubMedId":"23008257","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy C-Means Clustering With Local Information and Kernel Metric for Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tip-gong-2219547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08481S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"369","xplore-issue":"6407512","articleId":"6305476","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6305477,"authors":[{"name":"Koray Kayabol","affiliation":["Istanbul Technical University, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6407512/6305477/6305477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Koray Kayabol (S'03\u2013M'09) was born in Turkey in 1977.

The implicit biocompatibility and nanoscale feasibility of MC make it a promising communication technology for nanonetworks. This paper provides a closed-form expression for the information capacity of an MC system based on the free diffusion of molecules, which is of primary importance to understand the performance of the MC paradigm. Unlike previous contributions, the provided capacity expression is independent from any coding scheme and takes into account the two main effects of the diffusion channel: the memory and the molecular noise. For this, the diffusion is decomposed into two processes, namely, the Fick's diffusion and the particle location displacement, which are analyzed as a cascade of two separate systems. The Fick's diffusion captures solely the channel memory, while the particle location displacement isolates the molecular noise. The MC capacity expression is obtained by combining the two systems as function of the diffusion coefficient, the temperature, the transmitter-receiver distance, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, and the average transmitted power. Numerical results show that a few kilobits per second can be reached within a distance range of tenth of micrometer and for an average transmitted power around 1 pW.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2219496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2219496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06305481.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of a Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication System With Channel Memory and Molecular Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of a Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication System With Channel Memory and Molecular Noise","volume":"59","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6305481/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234707","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305481/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of a Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication System With Channel Memory and Molecular Noise","sourcePdf":"tit-pierobon-2219496-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079922S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6305481","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6305486,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6305486/6305486-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Zhou (S\u201910) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

In this system, each qZSI module serves as an MIC and is connected to one PV panel. Due to the cascaded structure and qZSI topology, the proposed MIC features low-voltage gain requirement, single-stage energy conversion, enhanced reliability, and good output power quality. Furthermore, the enhancement mode gallium nitride field-effect transistors (eGaN FETs) are employed in the qZSI module for efficiency improvement at higher switching frequency. It is found that the qZSI is very suitable for the application of eGaN FETs because of the shoot-through capability. Optimized module design is developed based on the derived qZSI ac equivalent model and power loss analytical model to achieve high efficiency and high power density. A design example of qZSI module is presented for a 250-W PV panel with 25-50-V output voltage. The simulation and experimental results prove the validity of the analytical models. The final module prototype design achieves up to 98.06% efficiency with 100-kHz switching frequency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Microwave integrated

We consider a limited feedback MU-MIMO CRN, where zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) is performed under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at a cognitive base station to mitigate both inter- and intranetwork interferences. To minimize the total feedback amount while satisfying the interference constraint and QoS requirements simultaneously, we propose to adaptively adjust the transmit power, select the transmission mode, and choose the feedback codebook size according to the interference constraint, CSI, and QoS requirements. The optimization problem is shown to be an integer programming problem, and we propose a heuristic algorithm that can provide an optimal solution for most practical scenarios. Results show that our resource-allocation strategy can decide the feedback amount and transmission mode adaptively based on the delay requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation in a Rateless-Coded MU-MIMO Cognitive Radio Network With QoS Provisioning and Limited Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2219568","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06305489.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2219568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resource Allocation in a Rateless-Coded MU-MIMO Cognitive Radio Network With QoS Provisioning and Limited Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6305489/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219888","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Resource Allocation in a Rateless-Coded MU-MIMO Cognitive Radio Network With QoS Provisioning and Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"tvt-yuen-2219568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066999S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6410063","articleId":"6305489","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6305492,"authors":[{"name":"Shichang Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratories of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6341879/6305492/6305492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shichang Chen (S'09) was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1987.

Comprehensive theoretical analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of imperfect current profile on the overall efficiency and give rise to the judicious solution. To validate the new theory, two DPA prototypes based on GaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs are implemented for comparative purposes. Measurement results show that 8% and 13% greater power-added efficiency values are achieved at saturation and 6-dB output back-off point with the proposed method when compared with that of the conventional one. Additionally, the output 1-dB compression point is also improved by 2.9 dB.

It is concluded that because the instantaneous voltage, current, power, and energy waveforms produced by the model agree well with experimental results, the model is suitable for transient simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13190976","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","volume":"3","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"A DC Arc Model for Series Faults in Low Voltage Microgrids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DC Arc Model for Series Faults in Low Voltage Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-uriarte-2201757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121043S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"67","articleId":"6305496","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6305525,"authors":[{"name":"Hae Young Rha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hae Young","lastName":"Rha","id":"38246433300"},{"name":"Byoung Goo Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Physics, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung Goo","lastName":"Jeon","id":"38253928700"},{"name":"Hae-Wook Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hae-Wook","lastName":"Choi","id":"38247635700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6305525","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Training","Frequency estimation","Accuracy","Frequency division multiplexing","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","estimation theory","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simple wide range carrier frequency offset estimator","coherent optical OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","wide carrier frequency offset","frequency inaccuracy","Chinese remainder theorem","fine estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset","Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)","optical fiber communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"Coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems have a wide carrier frequency offset (CFO) range due to the frequency inaccuracy of lasers.

For the proposed estimator, a training symbol structure consisting of two identical symbols is also suggested. The sizes of subsymbols of the training symbols are relatively prime to apply CRT.

We propose a content adaptive spatial and temporal pooling strategy based on the observed distribution. Our method adaptively emphasizes \u201cworst\u201d scores along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of a video sequence and also considers the perceptual effect of large-area cohesive motion flow such as egomotion.

Due to the TEG's low voltage, a topology that produces a high step-up gain for a moderate duty cycle is required to reduce voltage and current stresses within the converter. The linear V-I characteristic produces a P-I characteristic with a flatter peak relative to other sources. This can result in large operating point variations while performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT); thus, an algorithm with low steady-state error is desired. This paper presents a novel high step-up dc/dc converter topology operating with a fractional short-circuit MPPT algorithm for use with a 4.2-V, 3.4-A (for matched load at \u0394T = 270 \u00b0C) TEG module and a converter output of 180 V. Compared to existing high step-up dc/dc converters, the proposed converter achieves higher gain with similar component count. Experimental results are reported to confirm the converter analysis and better performance of the short-circuit MPPT algorithm over the perturb and observe algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06305531.pdf","startPage":"3147","endPage":"3157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2219393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2219393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Step-Up DC/DC Topology and MPPT Algorithm for Use With a Thermoelectric Generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Topology","Capacitors","Discharges (electric)","Windings","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","maximum power point trackers","thermoelectric conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high step-up DC-DC topology","thermoelectric generator","TEG","low-voltage high-current dc power source","linear characteristic","power converter","moderate duty cycle","current stress reduction","voltage reduction","linear V-I characteristic","P-I characteristics","maximum power point tracking","steady-state error","short-circuit MPPT algorithm","voltage 4.2 V","current 3.4 A"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC power conversion","thermoelectric energy conversion","tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"High Step-Up DC/DC Topology and MPPT Algorithm for Use With a Thermoelectric Generator","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6305531/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191052","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Step-Up DC/DC Topology and MPPT Algorithm for Use With a Thermoelectric Generator","sourcePdf":"tpel-laird-2219393-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100824S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6305531","onlineDate":"18 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6305546,"authors":[{"name":"Komathy Karuppanan","affiliation":["Easwari Engineering College, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Komathy","lastName":"Karuppanan","id":"37947868600"},{"name":"Abinaya Sree Vairasundaram","affiliation":["Easwari Engineering College, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Abinaya Sree","lastName":"Vairasundaram","id":"38478886100"},{"name":"Manjula Sigamani","affiliation":["Easwari Engineering College, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Manjula","lastName":"Sigamani","id":"38487066600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1911-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4723-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305546","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Particle swarm optimization","Accuracy","Polynomials","Genetic algorithms","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","diseases","genetic algorithms","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["COPD prognosis","biologically inspired neural network","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","time series","comprehensive predictive model","polynomial neural network","swarm intelligence","discrete particle swarm optimization","DPSO","relevant neurons","multimodal genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Swarm Intelligence","Time Series Prediction","Support vector classifier","Condensed Polynomial Neural Network","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305546","abstract":"This paper proposes a prognostic model for rehabilitating the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in real time.

These methods include time domain methods, frequency domain methods, and time-frequency methods. This work discusses the appropriateness of Time Frequency Analysis(TFA) to classify EEG signals for epileptic seizures and compares several methods for time-frequency analysis. The methods are evaluated using three classification problems. The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is used for classification of EEG segments.

This excessive discharge is shown in EEG as epileptic spikes which are complementary source of information in diagnosis and localization of epilepsy. Currently there are many techniques for the diagnosis and monitoring of epilepsy. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have proved to be an effective approach for a broad spectrum of applications for EEG signals because of its self-adaptation and natural way to organize and implement the redundancy. This paper proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses Feed forward Artificial Neural Network incorporating sliding window technique for pattern recognition. This work utilizes 100 single channel EEG signals obtained from the database of Epilepsy Centre in Bonn, Germany. The algorithm was trained with 50 datasets and tested for 25 normal data and 25 epileptic data sets. The performance of classification using Feed forward Artificial Neural Network gave a high success rate of 93.37% for distinguishing normal signals and 95.5% for epileptic signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13000609","htmlLink":"/document/6305563/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"9-11 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Normal and Epileptic EEG Signal Using Time & Frequency Domain Features through Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Normal and Epileptic EEG Signal Using Time & Frequency Domain Features through Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"4723a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027151S","chronDate":"9-11 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305052","isNumber":"6305512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305052","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6305512","articleId":"6305563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6305574,"authors":[{"name":"Debjani Basu","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Debjani","lastName":"Basu","id":"38478916500"},{"name":"Dipak K.

These gases are harmful for human health. We are focusing on the development of an intelligent sensory system which can detect the extent poisonous gases found in manhole gas mixture. A gas sensor array is used for this purpose. Sensor responses are cross-sensitive, because multiple gas sensors are simultaneously used to detect multiple gases. The cross-sensitivity is an overlapping effect of one gas on sensor of another, inducing thereby difficulty in sensing mechanism all together. We resort to artificial neural network (ANN) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for the development intelligent sensory system. The SA algorithm is used to search out optimized combination of synaptic weights for the ANN trained for sensing proportion of constituent gases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Neural networks","Gases","Vectors","Gas detectors","Artificial intelligence","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","gas sensors","neural nets","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuro simulated annealing algorithm","component gases proportion detection","manhole gas mixture","design issues","intelligent gas recognizer","ammonia","carbon dioxide","carbon monoxide","hydrogen sulfide","methane","nitrogen oxide","intelligent sensory system","extent poisonous gases detection","multiple gas sensors","artificial neural network","ANN","SA","NH3","CO2","CO","H2S","CH4","NO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gas Mixture","Gas Sensor Array","Cross-Sensitivity","Neural Network","Simulated Annealing","Optimization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2012.54","startPage":"238","endPage":"241","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6305052/6305512/06305597.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2012.54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Neuro Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Detecting Proportion of Component Gases in Manhole Gas Mixture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Neuro Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Detecting Proportion of Component Gases in Manhole Gas Mixture","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13000643","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305597/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Neuro Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Detecting Proportion of Component Gases in Manhole Gas Mixture","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"4723a238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09866S","chronDate":"9-11 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305052","isNumber":"6305512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305052","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6305512","articleId":"6305597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6305645,"authors":[{"name":"Shaolei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Weaponry Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shaolei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38485819000"},{"name":"Weiyi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Weaponry Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Weiyi","lastName":"Chen","id":"38479768800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1902-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305645","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305645","abstract":"The weapon-target assignment is a very complicated problem and a key point in the warship formations' air defense operation.

Firstly the data set is multiplied n times, i.e., n instances are generated for each type of antigen, then each instance is assessed, and finally the n assessments of each type of antigen will be merged to get the final result.

These two learning issues should be addressed respectively in two learning phases of the system, i.e., the off-line learning and the on-line learning. The SOM-LVQ model is thus proposed in this paper. Compared with conventional decision models and typical BP neural network model, the SOM-LVQ provides a knowledge structure based on which the on-line learning is much easier to fulfill. An intelligent decision system based on the SOM-LVQ model was built.

Using back-propagation (BP) neural network, the non-linear relationship model among the corrosion weight losses (W), corrosion parameters (corrosion time, H3PO4 concentration) and alloy composition (carbon content) is established according to the tested experimental data. The results show that the neural network model can predict the corrosion weight loss precisely according to corrosion conditions and alloy composition. The prediction results reveal that the corrosion resistance of high speed steel decrease with the increase of H3PO4 concentration or carbon content in high speed steel.

While they present interesting characteristics, such as spatiotemporal granularity and low cost, they also create new problems and challenges. One key challenge in PS systems is that of the determination of the locations and number of users where to obtain samples from so that we can accurately represent the variable of interest with a low number of participants. This paper proposes the use of density maps, based on the current estimations of the variable, to address this challenge. The density maps are then utilized by the incentive mechanism in order to encourage the participation of those users indicated in the map. Our results show how the density maps greatly improve the quality of the estimations while maintaining a stable and low total number of users in the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6305821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6305821/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13000459","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Density Maps: Determining Where to Sample in Participatory Sensing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density Maps: Determining Where to Sample in Participatory Sensing Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4727a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051581S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6305021","isNumber":"6305804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6305021","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6305804","articleId":"6305821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6305831,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghai Ou","affiliation":["Technical Centre of Internet of Things, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Ou","id":"38474073600"},{"name":"Yan Zhen","affiliation":["Technical Centre of Internet of Things, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhen","id":"38184055000"},{"name":"Xiangzhen Li","affiliation":["Technical Centre of Internet of Things, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangzhen","lastName":"Li","id":"38067414700"},{"name":"Yiying Zhang","affiliation":["Technical Centre of Internet of Things, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yiying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38025391400"},{"name":"Lingkang Zeng","affiliation":["Technical Centre of Internet of Things, State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingkang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38061275900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1956-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4727-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6305831","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3787},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6305831","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transmission lines","Monitoring","Smart grids","Conductors","Temperature sensors","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","power transmission","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","smart grid power transmission","IoT technology","power grid system","power grid infrastructure","natural disasters","reliability","power transmission line","online monitoring system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Smart grid","Power transmission"]}],"abstract":"Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology in smart grid is an important approach to speed up the informatization of power grid system, and it is beneficial for effective management of the power grid infrastructure.

Previous studies have shown that the performance of DAX in minimizing the effects of phase aberration diminishes with increasing aberrator strength. To achieve greater improvement in image contrast, we propose, in this paper, to combine DAX with a phase aberration correction algorithm based on nearest-neighbor cross-correlation (NNCC). Our simulation and experimental results presented in this work showed that the proposed method allows for synergistic enhancements of image contrast and achieves greater improvement in image quality than using DAX alone or phase aberration correction alone in the presence of weak and strong aberrators. Compared with standard delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, using the proposed method on simulated data with weak and strong aberrations increased the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values from 4.10 to 10.96 and from 1.69 to 9.80, respectively. Experimental results were obtained using pork tissues of 4 and 10 mm thickness and a tissue-mimicking phantom. The CNR values increased from 3.74 to 9.72 for the 4-mm pork aberrator and from 1.27 to 8.17 for the 10-mm pork aberrator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6306032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","volume":"59","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"12999077","pubMedId":"23007784","publicationDate":"September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6306032/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synergistic enhancements of ultrasound image contrast with a combination of phase aberration correction and dual apodization with cross-correlation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergistic enhancements of ultrasound image contrast with a combination of phase aberration correction and dual apodization with cross-correlation","sourcePdf":"t1292089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064378S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6305991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6305991","articleId":"6306032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6306058,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Saleh Tavazoei","affiliation":["Department of ElectricalEngineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Saleh Tavazoei (Tavazoei@sharif.edu) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.

The use of proportional and integral feedback also has a long history of practical applications [4]. For example, in the middle of the 18th century, centrifugal governors as the proportional feedback were applied to regulate the speed of windmills [5]. By the 19th century, it was known that using integral feedback could remove the offsets appearing in working with governors [6]. At present, PI control, still a very basic form of feedback, is also one of the first solutions often considered in the control of industrial systems [7]. On the other hand, in some applications, using the PI controller in its traditional form may not be satisfactory, and a more advanced controller is needed to achieve control objectives. In such cases, modified versions of the PI controller have been proposed to enhance the controller's performance. The fractional-order PI controller is one of these modified versions, and it is attracting increased interest in control system design uses [8], [9]. The idea of using such a controller originated with fractional calculus, known as a generalization for classical calculus [10]. The following section presents a brief review of recent fractional calculus applications in control system design.","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2012.2207818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4154573/6306035/06306058.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2012.2207818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306035","startPage":"41","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Traditional to Fractional PI Control: A Key for Generalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6306058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"From Traditional to Fractional PI Control: A Key for Generalization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6306058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12999002","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6306058/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Traditional to Fractional PI Control: A Key for Generalization","sourcePdf":"06mie03-tavazoei-2207818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127964S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"6306035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6306035","articleId":"6306058","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6306093,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Omid Shahdi","affiliation":["Computer Vision, Video and Image Processing (CvviP) Research Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Seyed Omid","lastName":"Shahdi","id":"38292035700"},{"name":"S.

This paper presents a new Discrete-Cosine transform matrix (DCTM) precoding based RI-OFDMA uplink system for high PAPR reduction. Computer simulation results show that the proposed precoding based uplink system has low PAPR as compare to those of the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) precoding based RI-OFDMA uplink systems and the conventional RI-OFDMA uplink systems respectively. Additionally, the biterror-rate (BER) performance of the proposed uplink system is much better than the conventional RI-OFDMA uplink systems and at par with the WHT precoded RI-OFDMA uplink systems. Therefore, such a good improvements in both PAPR and BER offered by the proposed precoding based uplink system can notably reduce the cost and complexity of the uplink transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6280852/6306059/06306100.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"684","publicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6306100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new DCT matrix precoding based RI-OFDMA uplink system for PAPR reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","discrete cosine transforms","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","Hadamard transforms","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT matrix precoding","RI-OFDMA uplink system","PAPR reduction","peak-to-average power ratio","transmitted random-interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access","RI-OFDMA uplink signal","analogue-to-digital convertors","digital-to-analogue convertors","D/A convertors","A/D convertors","Walsh-Hadamard transform precoding based RI-OFDMA uplink systems","bit-error-rate","BER performance","OFDMA uplink systems","precoding based uplink system","uplink transmitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6306100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new DCT matrix precoding based RI-OFDMA uplink system for PAPR reduction","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6306100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13001024","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new DCT matrix precoding based RI-OFDMA uplink system for PAPR reduction","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"J1311569548179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054547S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6280852","isNumber":"6306059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6280852","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6306059","articleId":"6306100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6306103,"authors":[{"name":"Aissa Boudjella","affiliation":["Al Khawarizmi International College, Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, AE"],"firstName":"Aissa","lastName":"Boudjella","id":"37426131000"},{"name":"Brahim Belhaouari Samir","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Brahim Belhaouari","lastName":"Samir","id":"37320638100"},{"name":"H.

The high computation power must be provided to support real time performance. This paper presents the implementation of VLSI based hardware accelerator design for real time video segmentation system. The algorithm of Sobel edge detection operator is used to develop this hardware accelerator. The NTSC standard definition video is digitized at 720\u00d7480 with a video rate of 30 frames per second. To develop hardware accelerator datapath architecture the management of memory access is deployed and architecture based pipeline are made with the potential improvements in acceleration to the read data pixel from memory. In addition, a finite state machine is used to ensure the hardware accelerator controls the sequence of derivative computation, the write and read operations. The hardware accelerator design is implemented on Altera Stratix III DSP development board and enables application of co-processor without requiring new application specific digital signal processor. The implementation result shows a field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) acting as coprocessor platforms for user defined co-processor, with real time performance at a frame rate of 30 fps with a resolution of 720 \u00d7 480. The parallel and pipeline technique are utilized in memory access, resulting more than 70% memory bandwidth reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306107","publicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6280852/6306059/06306107.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI based edge detection hardware accelerator for real time video segmentation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6306107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"VLSI based edge detection hardware accelerator for real time video segmentation system","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6306107/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13001029","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI based edge detection hardware accelerator for real time video segmentation system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"K1381569561325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067805S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6280852","isNumber":"6306059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6280852","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6306059","articleId":"6306107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-18"},{"_id":6306109,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Chee Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Malaysia","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tan Chee","lastName":"Wei","id":"38481265100"},{"name":"Bakhtiar Affendi Bin Rosdi","affiliation":["Universiti Sains Malaysia, Minden, Pulau Pinang, MY"],"firstName":"Bakhtiar Affendi Bin","lastName":"Rosdi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1967-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1968-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1966-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6306109","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Veins","Hardware","Computer architecture","Correlation","Biomedical imaging","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image matching","security of data","vein recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based band-limited phase-only correlation","BLPOC","finger vein recognition system","biometric research","software-based system","matching method","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"Finger vein recognition has become one of the major interests in biometric research due to the higher level of security provided.

The comparison showed that ANNEbot provided a higher degree of accuracy in contrast to the more commonly used machine learning algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306155","pdfPath":"/iel5/6280852/6306141/06306155.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","publicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANNEbot: An evolutionary artificial neural network framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6306155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"ANNEbot: An evolutionary artificial neural network framework","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13013403","publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6306155/","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANNEbot: An evolutionary artificial neural network framework","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"A0081569576951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055225S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6280852","isNumber":"6306141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6280852","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6306141","articleId":"6306155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6306156,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elkattan","affiliation":["Nuclear Materials Authority, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elkattan","id":"38469678300"},{"name":"Ahmed Salem","affiliation":["GETECH, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Salem","id":"37950440900"},{"name":"Fouad Soliman","affiliation":["Nuclear Materials Authority, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Fouad","lastName":"Soliman","id":"37349165000"},{"name":"Aladin Kamel","affiliation":["Electronics Department, Ain shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Aladin","lastName":"Kamel","id":"37584918200"},{"name":"Hadia El-Hennawy","affiliation":["Nuclear Materials Authority, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hadia","lastName":"El-Hennawy","id":"37284236500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1967-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1968-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1966-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6306156","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Landmine detection","Magnetic moments","Hopfield neural networks","Magnetometers","Magnetic field measurement","Microcontrollers","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","Hopfield neural nets","landmine detection","magnetic moments","magnetometers","microcontrollers","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcontroller based neural network","landmine detection","magnetic gradient","Hopfield neural network","gradiometer magnetic data","optimization","magnetic moment","dipole source","landmine representation","stable energy state","landmine location"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vertical Magnetic Gradient","Magnetic Moment","Microcontroller","Hopfield Neural Network","Landmine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6306156","abstract":"Landmines are affecting the live and livelihood of millions of people around the world.

The advent of the 4G systems in future have adopted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) as its key feature. Modern day antennas have been scaled down to fit in the compact hand held wireless communication devices. Due to this trend antenna engineers are compelled to design the antennas which are suitable to fit in the compact chassis of hand held terminals. The requirement of size reduction becomes even stringent in case of MIMO systems. It is more challenging to accommodate multiple antennas within a small perimeter of the congested device. Moreover, the mutual coupling or electrical interference between the multiple element antenna (MEA) deteriorates the potential benefits of MIMO system. In this paper a novel hybrid multiband Koch-meander Fractal antenna has been proposed for the application in the WLAN. The proposed single element antenna (SEA) has been optimized to yield all the bands of IEEE 802.11 a/b/g standard. Further, the authors have transformed the SEA into different MEA configurations i.e., two element antenna, two element antenna with enhanced inter element distance and three element antenna configuration for MIMO/diversity systems. The study on the MEA shows that when the antennas are tightly placed adjacent to each other they suffer from high mutual coupling due to lack of an isolation mechanism. However, the 3-D radiation patterns indicate that the mutual coupling between antennas introduced pattern diversity.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306186","publicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6280852/6306141/06306186.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and parametric study of multiple element MIMO antennas for WLAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6306186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2012","xploreNote":"As originally published there was an error in this document.

The operating frequencies of the design were based on the TIA-603C standard for Land Mobile FM Communication Equipment (136-941MHz), which is the preferred standard used by established two-way radio suppliers. The technical specification was also deduced from the TIA-603C standard receiver system sensitivity and intermodulation. The LNA adopts a negative feedback wideband amplifier topology where the negative feedback is to counter the long RF trace problem inherited at the targeted frequencies. This proposed topology can solve the problem of economically impractical PCB size rendered by other wideband amplifier methods. The measured results show the proposed LNA has a stable gain of 12dB, more than 13dBm of IIP3 and a noise figure of less than 1.5dB. The whole design consumes 80mA of current from a 5V supply.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306193","publicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6280852/6306141/06306193.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"236","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2012.6306193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband low noise amplifier design for software defined radio at 136 to 941 MHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Wideband low noise amplifier design for software defined radio at 136 to 941 MHz","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6306193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13001089","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6306193/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband low noise amplifier design for software defined radio at 136 to 941 MHz","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"E0461569561137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047538S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6280852","isNumber":"6306141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6280852","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6306141","articleId":"6306193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6306194,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

Several topologies are investigated in the literature for multi-phase drive system. The most popular among them are five-phase and six-phase. In six-phase system two topologies exist. In one topology, the windings or phases are 60 degrees apart and called symmetrical six-phase system. The second topology has two sets of three-phases and is displaced by 30 degrees. This is called quasi-six-phase or dual three-phase. In this paper, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique is described for a quasi six-phase voltage source inverter (VSI). The output of the inverter is two set of three-phases with 30 phase displacement. The proposed PWM is based on the artificial neural network concept. ANN method of PWM is highly useful for high switching frequency operation.

It therefore requires rectangular-shaped stator phase currents to produce constant torque. The Motors possess high torque/weight ratio, operate at very high speed, are very compact and are electronically controlled. The advantage of these motors is the removal of brushes, leading to eliminate many problems associated with brushes. BLDCM drives have been focused on the motor control strategies. Nevertheless, most of these converter topologies employ the hard-switching technique which causes high switching losses and severe electromagnetic interference. Recently, a number of soft-switching techniques, providing zero-voltage switching (ZVS) or zero-current switching (ZCS) condition, have been successfully developed.

This paper presents a hybrid memory design that tightly integrates embedded DRAM into SRAM cells with a main application to reducing area and power consumption of multi-threaded register files. In the hybrid memory, each SRAM cell is augmented with multiple DRAM cells so that multiple bits can be stored in each cell. This configuration results in significant area and energy savings compared to the SRAM array with the same capacity due to compact DRAM cells. On other hand, the hybrid memory requires explicit data movements in order to access DRAM contexts. In order to minimize context switching impact, we introduce write-back buffers, background context switching, and context-aware thread scheduling, to the processor pipeline and the scheduler. Circuit and architecture simulations of GPU benchmarks suites show significant savings in register file area (38%) and energy (68%) over the traditional SRAM implementation, with minimal (1.4%) performance loss.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307179.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM-DRAM hybrid memory with applications to efficient register files in fine-grained multi-threading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"SRAM-DRAM hybrid memory with applications to efficient register files in fine-grained multi-threading","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307179/","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"13000244","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307179/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM-DRAM hybrid memory with applications to efficient register files in fine-grained multi-threading","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p247yu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082721S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6307191,"authors":[{"name":"Sarit Kongtonpisan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bankok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sarit","lastName":"Kongtonpisan","id":"37704992500"},{"name":"Surachai Chaitusaney","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bankok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Surachai","lastName":"Chaitusaney","id":"38478556500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0547-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0545-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0546-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-4839"}],"articleNumber":"6307191","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307191","abstract":"This paper presents a loss reduction in distribution system with photovoltaic system by considering fixed and automatic switching capacitor banks using genetic algorithm (GA).

However, OFDM system is sensitive to the error of synchronization. Accurate symbol timing and carrier frequency offset estimation are crucial to the PLC system based on OFDM. In this paper, a new metric rule was proposed for timing synchronization. The delay and correlation algorithms as well as the novel synchronization algorithm proposed were used in a realistic low voltage power line. The performances of three timing synchronization algorithms were compared. The proposed approach was independent of the frequency offset and robust to the multi-path fading channels.

Their operation are often crucial in various electrical applications affecting the every day life. Therefore, the quality of the converters needs to be reliably verified. Recent studies shows that the converters can be fully characterized by a set of frequency responses which can be efficiently used to validate the proper operation of the converters. Consequently, several methods have been proposed to measure the frequency responses fast and accurately. This paper extends those methods and proposes the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-identification techniques. Compared to the conventional methods, where a system is analyzed through single-input experiments, the proposed techniques provide several advantages such as shorter experiment time.

Simulation results of 4-machine-11-bus IEEE test system show that the proposed method is effective and robust.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2012.6307597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2012.6307597","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304951/6306868/06307597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Robust Control Considering Uncertainties for Damping Oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Robust Control Considering Uncertainties for Damping Oscillations","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307597/","accessionNumber":"13015533","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307597/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Robust Control Considering Uncertainties for Damping Oscillations","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"04-04-018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058209S","chronDate":"27-29 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304951","isNumber":"6306868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304951","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6306868","articleId":"6307597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6307621,"authors":[{"name":"Liangyu Ma","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Liangyu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37404301400"},{"name":"Xing Cao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Cao","id":"38480768300"},{"name":"Yinping Ge","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Yinping","lastName":"Ge","id":"38483598900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0547-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0545-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0546-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-4839"}],"articleNumber":"6307621","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Neural networks","Circuit faults","Heating","Transient analysis","Predictive models","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","feedforward neural nets","power engineering computing","power generation faults","steam power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power plant transient fault diagnostics","two-stage neural networks","improved Elman neural network","time-delay sequence input","normalized fault symptoms","fault classification","conventional feedforward network","real-time fault diagnosis","leakage faults","feedwater heaters","expected value prediction model","fault feature variables","steady-state load condition","load-varying transient process","two-stage NN fault diagnosis method","detailed fault diagnosis simulation tests","supercritical power unit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307621","abstract":"In order to realize power plant transient fault diagnosis, a fault diagnosis approach based on two-stage neural networks is proposed.

The second neural network uses a conventional feedforward network to fulfill real-time fault diagnosis. By taking the inner leakage faults of the feedwater heaters of a 600MW supercritical unit as example investigated, an expected value prediction model of the fault feature variables is built, trained and validated by a large amount of historical operating data, including typical steady-state load conditions and load-varying transient processes.

At present, whole process cost management is adopted by most of the domestic power enterprises. But costs of the power loss, maintenance and fault loss are not considered; so to some extent, whole process cost management is narrow and limited. On the basis of LCC management, this dissertation discussed the whole process which includes planning, design, construction, purchase, operation, maintenance and disposal. Transmission line usually shares large percentage of whole project costs. What's more, changes of wire scheme will bring changes to tower and foundation design. Thus whole project costs are greatly impacted. The changes directly influence construction costs of the whole transmission line project, technical feature after construction and operation costs. Thus, this dissertation resolved the LCC of the whole power transmission line, at the mean time; transmission line wire type selection model and algorithm which based on LCC are the key point of the research. In this dissertation, basic principles of transmission lines wire selection are integrated into LCC theory. Objective function of wire type selection, which is on the basis of investment cost, operation wastage cost, maintenance cost, fault loss cost and retirement cost, is constructed.","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6304951/6306868/06307742.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2012.6307742","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2012.6307742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of LCC Model of High-Voltage Transmission Line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of LCC Model of High-Voltage Transmission Line","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307742/","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6307742/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"13015677","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of LCC Model of High-Voltage Transmission Line","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"05-04-127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051544S","chronDate":"27-29 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6304951","isNumber":"6306868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6304951","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6306868","articleId":"6307742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6307765,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjia Tang","affiliation":["University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Lingjia","lastName":"Tang","id":"37690063700"},{"name":"Jason Mars","affiliation":["University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Mars","id":"37297735100"},{"name":"Neil Vachharajani","affiliation":["Pure Storage, USA"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Vachharajani","id":"37265261100"},{"name":"Robert Hundt","affiliation":["Google, Inc., USA","Google"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hundt","id":"37282561600"},{"name":"Mary Lou Soffa","affiliation":["University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Mary Lou","lastName":"Soffa","id":"37281764100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6897"}],"articleNumber":"6307765","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":503},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Yarn","Sockets","Instruction sets","Resource management","Bandwidth","Multicore processing","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","computer centres","Internet","multi-threading","resource allocation","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory subsystem resource sharing","Google datacenter applications","Web search engine","Bigtable","content analyzer","image stitching","protocol buffer","PARSEC benchmark suite","thread-to-core mappings","application characteristics","heuristics-based approach","adaptive approach","performance improvement","thread colocation","bus bandwidth","cache sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance","Experimentation","Measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307765","abstract":"In this paper we study the impact of sharing memory resources on five Google datacenter applications: a web search engine, bigtable, content analyzer, image stitching, and protocol buffer.

In this paper, we first present a study of the importance of thread-to-core mappings for applications in the datacenter as threads can be mapped to share or to not share caches and bus bandwidth. Second, we investigate the impact of co-locating threads from multiple applications with diverse memory behavior and discover that the best mapping for a given application changes depending on its co-runner. Third, we investigate the application characteristics that impact performance in the various thread-to-core mapping scenarios. Finally, we present both a heuristics-based and an adaptive approach to arrive at good thread-to-core decisions in the datacenter. We observe performance swings of up to 25% for web search and 40% for other key applications, simply based on how application threads are mapped to cores. By employing our adaptive thread-to-core mapper, the performance of the datacenter applications presented in this work improved by up to 22% over status quo thread-to-core mapping and performs within 3% of optimal.","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","startPage":"283","endPage":"294","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307765.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of memory subsystem resource sharing on datacenter applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307765/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"The impact of memory subsystem resource sharing on datacenter applications","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"13013295","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of memory subsystem resource sharing on datacenter applications","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p283tang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083146S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6307771,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram Govindan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Govindan","id":"37404041200"},{"name":"Anand Sivasubramaniam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Sivasubramaniam","id":"37273174700"},{"name":"Bhuvan Urgaonkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhuvan","lastName":"Urgaonkar","id":"37404034800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6897"}],"articleNumber":"6307771","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uninterruptible power systems","Batteries","Discharges (electric)","Availability","Runtime","US Department of Defense"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","computer power supplies","power aware computing","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stored energy","datacenter power consumption","electricity bill recurrence","one-time construction costs","Op-ex","Cap-ex","throttling devices","performance degrading implications","energy buffer","eBuff","UPS battery knob","fail-over mechanism","power sources","battery lifetime","datacenter availability concerns","peak reduction algorithms","throttling based techniques","datacenter power costs minimization","peak power draw problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery","Datacenter","Peak power","UPS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307771","abstract":"Datacenter power consumption has a significant impact on both its recurring electricity bill (Op-ex) and one-time construction costs (Cap-ex). Existing work optimizing these costs has relied primarily on throttling devices or workload shaping, both with performance degrading implications. In this paper, we present a novel knob of energy buffer (eBuff) available in the form of UPS batteries in datacenters for this cost optimization. Intuitively, eBuff stores energy in UPS batteries during \u201cvalleys\u201d - periods of lower demand, which can be drained during \u201cpeaks\u201d - periods of higher demand. UPS batteries are normally used as a fail-over mechanism to transition to captive power sources upon utility failure. Furthermore, frequent discharges can cause UPS batteries to fail prematurely. We conduct detailed analysis of battery operation to figure out feasible operating regions given such battery lifetime and datacenter availability concerns. Using insights learned from this analysis, we develop peak reduction algorithms that combine the UPS battery knob with existing throttling based techniques for minimizing datacenter power costs. Using an experimental platform, we offer insights about Op-ex savings offered by eBuff for a wide range of workload peaks/valleys, UPS provisioning, and application SLA constraints. We find that eBuff can be used to realize 15-45% peak power reduction, corresponding to 6-18% savings in Op-ex across this spectrum. eBuff can also play a role in reducing Cap-ex costs by allowing tighter overbooking of power infrastructure components and we quantify the extent of such Cap-ex savings. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to exploit stored energy - typically lying untapped in the datacenter - to address the peak power draw problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307771.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits and limitations of tapping into stored energy for datacenters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307771/","displayDocTitle":"Benefits and limitations of tapping into stored energy for datacenters","htmlLink":"/document/6307771/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13000263","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits and limitations of tapping into stored energy for datacenters","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p341govindan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113612S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6307773,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Esmaeilzadeh","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Esmaeilzadeh","id":"37267164000"},{"name":"Emily Blem","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Blem","id":"38484238900"},{"name":"Ren\u00e9e St. Amant","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Ren\u00e9e St.","lastName":"Amant","id":"38480713000"},{"name":"Karthikeyan Sankaralingam","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Sankaralingam","id":"37398408100"},{"name":"Doug Burger","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Burger","id":"37282750500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6897"}],"articleNumber":"6307773","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":339,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":5613},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Topology","Performance evaluation","Organizations","Transistors","Microarchitecture","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","network topology","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dark silicon","processor designers","Moore's law scaling","single-core performance","Dennard scaling","multicore parts","single-core scaling","multicore scaling limits","speedup potential","parallel workloads","technology generations","ITRS projections","device scaling parameters","Pareto-optimal frontiers","performance model","upper-bound performance","lower-bound core power","multicore designs","single-threaded CPU-like multicore chip organizations","massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations","asymmetric topology","dynamic topology","composed topology","chip topology","computing community","fixed-size chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dark Silicon","Modeling","Power","Technology Scaling","Multicore"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307773","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307773.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dark silicon and the end of multicore scaling","abstract":"Since 2005, processor designers have increased core counts to exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9\u00d7 average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307773/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13000264","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6307773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dark silicon and the end of multicore scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dark silicon and the end of multicore scaling","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p365esmaeilzadeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105607S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"339","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6307775,"authors":[{"name":"Boris Grot","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Grot","id":"37669789100"},{"name":"Joel Hestness","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Hestness","id":"38480735700"},{"name":"Stephen W.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate technologies to enable networks-on-chip (NOCs) to support a thousand connected components (Kilo-NOC) with high area and energy efficiency, good performance, and strong quality-of-service (QOS) guarantees. Our analysis shows that QOS support burdens the network with high area and energy costs. In response, we propose a new lightweight topology-aware QOS architecture that provides service guarantees for applications such as consolidated servers on CMPs and real-time SOCs. Unlike prior NOC quality-of-service proposals which require QOS support at every network node, our scheme restricts the extent of hardware support to portions of the die, reducing router complexity in the rest of the chip. We further improve network area- and energy-efficiency through a novel flow control mechanism that enables a single-network, low-cost elastic buffer implementation. Together, these techniques yield a heterogeneous Kilo-NOC architecture that consumes 45% less area and 29% less power than a state-of-the-art QOS-enabled NOC without these features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307775.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kilo-NOC: A heterogeneous network-on-chip architecture for scalability and service guarantees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Topology","Network topology","Scalability","Complexity theory","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous network-on-chip architecture","scalability guarantees","chip-level multiprocessors","CMP","cache tiles","quality-of-service guarantees","QOS","lightweight topology-aware QOS architecture","energy-efficiency","flow control mechanism","elastic buffer implementation","Kilo-NOC architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Measurement","Performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Kilo-NOC: A heterogeneous network-on-chip architecture for scalability and service guarantees","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"13000265","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kilo-NOC: A heterogeneous network-on-chip architecture for scalability and service guarantees","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p401grot.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102059S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6307777,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan Binkert","affiliation":["HP Labs, Palo Alto, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Binkert","id":"37332362100"},{"name":"Al Davis","affiliation":["HP Labs, Palo Alto, USA"],"firstName":"Al","lastName":"Davis","id":"37272448500"},{"name":"Norman P.

The ITRS projections for signal-pin count and per-pin bandwidth are nearly flat over the next decade, so increased radix in electronic switches will come at the cost of less per-port bandwidth. Silicon nanophotonic technology provides a long-term solution to this problem. We first compare the use of photonic I/O against an all-electrical, Cray YARC inspired baseline. We compare the power and performance of switches of radix 64, 100, and 144 in the 45, 32, and 22 nm technology steps. In addition with the greater off-chip bandwidth enabled by photonics, the high power of electrical components inside the switch becomes a problem beyond radix 64. We propose an optical switch architecture that exploits high-speed optical interconnects to build a flat crossbar with multiple-writer, single-reader links. Unlike YARC, which uses small buffers at various stages, the proposed design buffers only at input and output ports. This simplifies the design and enables large buffers, capable of handling ethernet-size packets. To mitigate head-of-line blocking and maximize switch throughput, we use an arbitration scheme that allows each port to make eight requests and use two grants. The bandwidth of the optical crossbar is also doubled to to provide a 2x internal speedup. Since optical interconnects have high static power, we show that it is critical to balance the use of optical and electrical components to get the best energy efficiency. Overall, the adoption of photonic I/O allows 100,000 port networks to be constructed with less than one third the power of equivalent all-electronic networks. A further 50% reduction in power can be achieved by using photonics within the switch components. Our best optical design performs similarly to YARC for small packets while consuming less than half the power, and handles 80% more load for large message traffic.","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307777.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of optics in future high radix switch design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307777/","displayDocTitle":"The role of optics in future high radix switch design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"13000267","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307777/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of optics in future high radix switch design","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p437binkert.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128033S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6307779,"authors":[{"name":"Alaa R.

However, processors cannot operate reliably below a minimum voltage, Vccmin, since hardware structures may fail. Cell failures in large memory arrays (e.g., caches) typically determine Vccmin for the whole processor. We observe that most cache lines exhibit zero or one failures at low voltages. However, a few lines, especially in large caches, exhibit multi-bit failures and increase Vccmin. Previous solutions either significantly reduce cache capacity to enable uniform error correction across all lines, or significantly increase latency and bandwidth overheads when amortizing the cost of error-correcting codes (ECC) over large lines. In this paper, we propose a novel cache architecture that uses variable-strength error-correcting codes (VS-ECC). In the common case, lines with zero or one failures use a simple and fast ECC. A small number of lines with multi-bit failures use a strong multi-bit ECC that requires some additional area and latency. We present a novel dynamic cache characterization mechanism to determine which lines will exhibit multi-bit failures. In particular, we use multi-bit correction to protect a fraction of the cache after switching to low voltage, while dynamically testing the remaining lines for multi-bit failures. Compared to prior multi-bit-correcting proposals, VS-ECC significantly reduces power and energy, avoids significant reductions in cache capacity, incurs little area overhead, and avoids large increases in latency and bandwidth.","startPage":"461","endPage":"471","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307779.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient cache design using variable-strength error-correcting codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307779/","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient cache design using variable-strength error-correcting codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13000269","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6307779/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient cache design using variable-strength error-correcting codes","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p461alameldeen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128101S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6307781,"authors":[{"name":"Asit K.

This is due to the many attractive features these memory technologies posses: high density, low leakage, and non-volatility. However, the latency and energy overhead associated with the write operations of these emerging memories has become a major obstacle in their adoption. Previous works have proposed various circuit and architectural level solutions to mitigate the write overhead. In this paper, we study the integration of STT-RAM in a 3D multi-core environment and propose solutions at the on-chip network level to circumvent the write overhead problem in the cache architecture with STT-RAM technology. Our scheme is based on the observation that instead of staggering requests to a write-busy STT-RAM bank, the network should schedule requests to other idle cache banks for effectively hiding the latency. Thus, we prioritize cache accesses to the idle banks by delaying accesses to the STTRAM cache banks that are currently serving long latency write requests. Through a detailed characterization of the cache access patterns of 42 applications, we propose an efficient mechanism to facilitate such delayed writes to cache banks by (a) accurately estimating the busy time of each cache bank through logical partitioning of the cache layer and (b) prioritizing packets in a router requesting accesses to idle banks. Evaluations on a 3D architecture, consisting of 64 cores and 64 STT-RAM cache banks, show that our proposed approach provides 14% average IPC improvement for multi-threaded benchmarks, 19% instruction throughput benefits for multi-programmed workloads, and 6% latency reduction compared to a recently proposed write buffering mechanism.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307781.pdf","startPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecting on-chip interconnects for stacked 3D STT-RAM caches in CMPs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307781/","displayDocTitle":"Architecting on-chip interconnects for stacked 3D STT-RAM caches in CMPs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","accessionNumber":"13013299","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6307781/","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecting on-chip interconnects for stacked 3D STT-RAM caches in CMPs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p69mishra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125675S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6307782,"authors":[{"name":"Jayesh Gaur","affiliation":["Intel Architecture Group, Intel Corporation, Bangalore, INDIA"],"firstName":"Jayesh","lastName":"Gaur","id":"37697767200"},{"name":"Mainak Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"38487313600"},{"name":"Sreenivas Subramoney","affiliation":["Intel Architecture Group, Intel Corporation, Bangalore, Malaysia","Intel Architecture Group, Intel Corporation, Bangalore, INDIA"],"firstName":"Sreenivas","lastName":"Subramoney","id":"38476117600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4503-0472-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6897"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6897"}],"articleNumber":"6307782","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":702},"abstract":"Inclusive last-level caches (LLCs) waste precious silicon estate due to cross-level replication of cache blocks. As the industry moves toward cache hierarchies with larger inner levels, this wasted cache space leads to bigger performance losses compared to exclusive LLCs. However, exclusive LLCs make the design of replacement policies more challenging. While in an inclusive LLC a block can gather a filtered access history, this is not possible in an exclusive design because the block is de-allocated from the LLC on a hit. As a result, the popular least-recently-used replacement policy and its approximations are rendered ineffective and proper choice of insertion ages of cache blocks becomes even more important in exclusive designs. On the other hand, it is not necessary to fill every block into an exclusive LLC. This is known as selective cache bypassing and is not possible to implement in an inclusive LLC because that would violate inclusion. This paper explores insertion and bypass algorithms for exclusive LLCs. Our detailed execution-driven simulation results show that a combination of our best insertion and bypass policies delivers an improvement of up to 61.2% and on average (geometric mean) 3.4% in terms of instructions retired per cycle (IPC) for 97 single-threaded dynamic instruction traces spanning selected SPEC 2006 and server applications, running on a 2 MB 16-way exclusive LLC compared to a baseline exclusive design in the presence of well-tuned multi-stream hardware prefetchers. The corresponding improvements in throughput for 35 4-way multi-programmed workloads running with an 8 MB 16-way shared exclusive LLC are 20.6% (maximum) and 2.5% (geometric mean).","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297871/6306756/06307782.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2011 38th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6306756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bypass and insertion algorithms for exclusive last-level caches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Algorithm design and analysis","Servers","Prefetching","Resource management","Hardware","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insertion algorithms","bypass algorithms","exclusive last-level caches","LLC","silicon estate","cross-level cache block replication","cache hierarchies","least-recently-used replacement policy","execution-driven simulation","instructions retired per cycle","IPC","single-threaded dynamic instruction traces","SPEC 2006","server applications","4-way multiprogrammed workloads","replacement policy design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exclusive last-level cache","bypass policy","insertion policy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bypass and insertion algorithms for exclusive last-level caches","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"13000270","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bypass and insertion algorithms for exclusive last-level caches","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p81gaur.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094979S","chronDate":"4-8 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6297871","isNumber":"6306756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297871","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6306756","articleId":"6307782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6307785,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Marco Bianchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37707890500"},{"name":"Giovanni Cancellieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Cancellieri","id":"37299823800"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6307785","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We present a new family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) convolutional codes that can be designed using ordered sets of progressive differences.

An alternative is to operate on random bit streams where the signal value is encoded by the probability of obtaining a one versus a zero. This representation is much less compact than binary radix. However, complex operations can be performed with very simple logic. Furthermore, since the representation is uniform, with all bits weighted equally, it is highly tolerant of soft errors (i.e., bit flips). Both combinational and sequential constructs have been proposed for operating on stochastic bit streams. Prior work has shown that combinational logic can implement multiplication and scaled addition effectively while linear finite-state machines (FSMs) can implement complex functions such as exponentiation and tanh effectively. Prior work on stochastic computation has largely been validated empirically.This paper provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of stochastic implementation of complex functions such as exponentiation and tanh implemented using linear FSMs. It presents two new functions, an absolute value function and exponentiation based on an absolute value, motivated by specific applications. Experimental results show that the linear FSM-based constructs for these functions have smaller area-delay products than the corresponding deterministic constructs. They also are much more tolerant of soft errors.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6828816/06307798.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6828816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logical Computation on Stochastic Bit Streams with Linear Finite-State Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Logical Computation on Stochastic Bit Streams with Linear Finite-State Machines","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6307798/","accessionNumber":"14379299","volume":"63","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logical Computation on Stochastic Bit Streams with Linear Finite-State Machines","sourcePdf":"tc-li-231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084897S","chronDate":"June  2014","isNumber":"6828816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"35","articleId":"6307798","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6307816,"authors":[{"name":"Rajni Gautam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Rajni","lastName":"Gautam","id":"38070494100"},{"name":"Manoj Saxena","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and the DDU College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37281845800"},{"name":"R.

For noise-corrupted speech, reliable pitch estimation is difficult. This paper presents a study of pitch estimation in noisy speech based on robust temporal-spectral representation and sparse reconstruction. We propose to accumulate spectral peaks over consecutive time frames. Since harmonic structure of speech changes much more slowly than noise spectrum, spectral peaks related to pitch harmonics would stand out over the noise through the accumulation. Experimental results show that the accumulated peak spectrum is indeed a robust representation of pitch harmonics. Subsequently, the accumulated peak spectrum is expressed as a sparse linear combination of a large set of clean peak spectrum exemplars. Gaussian mixture density is used to model noise spectrum peaks. The weights of the linear combination are estimated so as to maximize the likelihood of the accumulated peak spectrum under sparsity constraint. Robust pitch estimation is done based on the sparse weights and the corresponding peak spectrum exemplars. The use of Gaussian mixture model leads to non-convexity of the objective function for sparse weight estimation.

Extensive experimental studies are carried out to evaluate performance of the proposed pitch estimation algorithms on a wide variety of noise conditions.

The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a successful deception attack.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","volume":"21","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"13706132","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cyber Security of Water SCADA Systems\u2014Part II: Attack Detection Using Enhanced Hydrodynamic Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyber Security of Water SCADA Systems\u2014Part II: Attack Detection Using Enhanced Hydrodynamic Models","sourcePdf":"tcst-amin-2211874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079224S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"6578094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"91","articleId":"6307833","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6307840,"authors":[{"name":"Yuntao Qian","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence, College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6484140/6307840/6307840-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuntao Qian (M'04) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in automatic control from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from Xidian University, Xi'an, in 1996.","In 1996\u20131998, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an.

Owing to its numerous and continuous spectral bands, hyperspectral data enable more accurate and reliable material classification than using panchromatic or multispectral imagery. However, high-dimensional spectral features and limited number of available training samples have caused some difficulties in the classification, such as overfitting in learning, noise sensitiveness, overloaded computation, and lack of meaningful physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral feature extraction and pixel classification method based on structured sparse logistic regression and 3-D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) texture features. The 3D-DWT decomposes a hyperspectral data cube at different scales, frequencies, and orientations, during which the hyperspectral data cube is considered as a whole tensor instead of adapting the data to a vector or matrix. This allows the capture of geometrical and statistical spectral-spatial structures. After the feature extraction step, sparse representation/modeling is applied for data analysis and processing via sparse regularized optimization, which selects a small subset of the original feature variables to model the data for regression and classification purpose. A linear structured sparse logistic regression model is proposed to simultaneously select the discriminant features from the pool of 3D-DWT texture features and learn the coefficients of the linear classifier, in which the prior knowledge about feature structure can be mapped into the various sparsity-inducing norms such as lasso, group, and sparse group lasso. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of linear models, we extended the linear sparse model to nonlinear classification by partitioning the feature space into subspaces of linearly separable samples. The advantages of our methods are validated on the real hyperspectral remote sensing data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2209657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6484140/06307840.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2209657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Structured Sparse Logistic Regression and Three-Dimensional Wavelet Texture Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Structured Sparse Logistic Regression and Three-Dimensional Wavelet Texture Features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307840/","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6307840/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13396643","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Structured Sparse Logistic Regression and Three-Dimensional Wavelet Texture Features","sourcePdf":"tgrs-qian-2209657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.270503S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6484140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"6484140","articleId":"6307840","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6307844,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Delgado Prieto","affiliation":["Motion Control and Industrial Applications Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Terrassa, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6497104/6307844/6307844-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miguel Delgado Prieto (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

In this context, this work presents a novel monitoring scheme applied to diagnose bearing faults. Apart from detecting local defects, i.e., single-point ball and raceway faults, it takes also into account the detection of distributed defects, such as roughness. The development of diagnosis methodologies considering both kinds of bearing faults is, nowadays, subject of concern in fault diagnosis of electrical machines. First, the method analyzes the most significant statistical-time features calculated from vibration signal. Then, it uses a variant of the curvilinear component analysis, a nonlinear manifold learning technique, for compression and visualization of the feature behavior. It allows interpreting the underlying physical phenomenon. This technique has demonstrated to be a very powerful and promising tool in the diagnosis area. Finally, a hierarchical neural network structure is used to perform the classification stage. The effectiveness of this condition-monitoring scheme has been verified by experimental results obtained from different operating conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6497104/06307844.pdf","startPage":"3398","endPage":"3407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2219838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2219838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bearing Fault Detection by a Novel Condition-Monitoring Scheme Based on Statistical-Time Features and Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Biological neural networks","Vibrations","Support vector machine classification","Feature extraction","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","condition monitoring","electric conduits","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","machine bearings","neural nets","pattern classification","power engineering computing","principal component analysis","statistical analysis","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification algorithm","operating condition","hierarchical neural network structure","feature compression","feature visualization","nonlinear manifold learning technique","curvilinear component analysis","vibration signal","distributed defect detection","raceway faults","point ball fault","electrical machine fault diagnosis","statistical time feature","condition monitoring scheme","bearing fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ball bearings","classification algorithms","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","induction motors","neural networks","vibrations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bearing Fault Detection by a Novel Condition-Monitoring Scheme Based on Statistical-Time Features and Neural Networks","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6307844/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13431028","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bearing Fault Detection by a Novel Condition-Monitoring Scheme Based on Statistical-Time Features and Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-delgadoprieto-2219838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080068S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6497104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"290","xplore-issue":"6497104","articleId":"6307844","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6307845,"authors":[{"name":"Darlan Alexandria Fernandes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Para\u00edba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6423965/6307845/6307845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Darlan Alexandria Fernandes (M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Para\u00edba, Campina Grande, Brazil, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","From 2007 to 2011, he was a Professor at the Industry Department in the Federal Center of Technological Education of Rio Grande do Norte.

As a consequence, we find out a total equivalence between the two modulations despite their different conceptions. The fundamentals of both techniques and a mathematical proof of their equivalence are unfolded. Also, the performances of the techniques with respect to the harmonic distortion and power switching loss are discussed.

This increasing power consumption has resulted in increasing dc voltage levels, to reduce energy losses and the size of wiring, as a result of the reduced current levels. However, traditional protections such as circuit breakers are not adequate for the protection of the new systems in high dc voltage, and consequently, it is necessary to introduce new technologies in the field of protection devices. One of these is the solid-state power controller (SSPC), which combines the functions of connecting loads to the bus bars and protecting electrical installations against overload and short circuits. On the other hand, within these electrical systems, the connection of certain loads, such as highly capacitive ones (dc-dc, inverters, etc.), implies the need to develop new control strategies to improve the connection process by SSPCs. This paper presents and analyzes a new advanced control strategy that optimizes the performance during the connection of highly capacitive loads using SSPCs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06307847.pdf","startPage":"5195","endPage":"5205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSPC Active Control Strategy by Optimal Trajectory of the Current for Onboard System Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2219832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2219832","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307847/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"SSPC Active Control Strategy by Optimal Trajectory of the Current for Onboard System Applications","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13563543","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6307847/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSPC Active Control Strategy by Optimal Trajectory of the Current for Onboard System Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-izquierdo-2219832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067395S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6307847","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6307849,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Rivera","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Technologies, Universidad de Talca, Curico, Chile","Department of Electronics Engineering, Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6307849/6307849-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Rivera (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics engineering and M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile, in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University, Valpara\u00edso, Chile, in 2011, with a scholarship from the Chilean Research Fund CONICYT.","During 2011 and 2012, he was working on a postdoctoral position and as a part-time Professor of digital signal processors and industrial electronics with Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University.

The method enables the natural balancing of single-phase single-branch NPC converters where natural balancing conditions do not occur. The application of the method presented in the three-phase NPC converter enables achievement of neutral dc-link voltage balance by the use of only one additional passive \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RLC</i>\n circuit.

Furthermore, unlike fingerprint verification, whose performance is assessed today with public benchmarks and protocols, performance of template protection approaches is often evaluated in heterogeneous scenarios, thus making it very difficult to compare existing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel protection technique for Minutia Cylinder-Code (MCC), which is a well-known local minutiae representation. A sophisticate algorithm is designed to reverse MCC (i.e., recovering original minutiae positions and angles). Systematic experimentations show that the new approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and, at the same time, provides a good protection of minutiae information and is robust against masquerade attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6307852/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136037","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noninvertible Minutia Cylinder-Code Representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noninvertible Minutia Cylinder-Code Representation","sourcePdf":"tifs-ferrara-2215326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100679S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6307852","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6307853,"authors":[{"name":"Cruz E.

Traditionally, EMD can be easily implemented and developed using a high-level computer language in a PC or DSP chip. However, it is difficult to implement EMD in a hardware environment. This paper develops EMD for real-time applications using a hardware-based FPGA. The proposed FPGA-based method calculates the upper and lower envelopes in EMD point by point by using a circular queue to temporarily store values of maxima and minima, from which the upper and lower envelopes in the EMD can be determined continuously. Additionally, an attempt is made to increase the efficiency of the computational process by cascading several identical modules as a serial pipeline structure in order to conduct an iterative loop for calculating the intrinsic mode functions in EMD. The fast process from the serial pipeline structure results in real-time computation with a sampling rate of up to 12.5 MHz and mitigation of the end effect. The proposed method is validated by the simulation results obtained by Quartus II and verified by FPGA (Altera Stratix III EP3SL150F1152C2) realization, revealing its effectiveness in real-time applications.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6342839/06307856.pdf","startPage":"3175","endPage":"3184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation for Real-Time Empirical Mode Decomposition","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2211460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2211460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation for Real-Time Empirical Mode Decomposition","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6307856/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation for Real-Time Empirical Mode Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tim-hong-2211460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069349S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6342839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6342839","articleId":"6307856","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6307860,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6353618/6307860/6307860-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Chen was a Professor with the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Hirosaki University, Aomori, Japan, from 2002 to 2007.

Typically, partitioning is conducted without regard to the task in hand. We propose a task-specific image partitioning framework to produce a region-based image representation that will lead to a higher task performance than that reached using any task-oblivious partitioning framework and existing supervised partitioning framework, albeit few in number. The proposed method partitions the image by means of correlation clustering, maximizing a linear discriminant function defined over a superpixel graph. The parameters of the discriminant function that define task-specific similarity/dissimilarity among superpixels are estimated based on structured support vector machine (S-SVM) using task-specific training data. The S-SVM learning leads to a better generalization ability while the construction of the superpixel graph used to define the discriminant function allows a rich set of features to be incorporated to improve discriminability and robustness. We evaluate the learned task-aware partitioning algorithms on three benchmark datasets. Results show that task-aware partitioning leads to better labeling performance than the partitioning computed by the state-of-the-art general-purpose and supervised partitioning algorithms. We believe that the task-specific image partitioning paradigm is widely applicable to improving performance in high-level image understanding tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2218822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6407512/06307861.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2218822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6407512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-Specific Image Partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307861/","displayDocTitle":"Task-Specific Image Partitioning","volume":"22","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219165","pubMedId":"23008253","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307861/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-Specific Image Partitioning","sourcePdf":"tip-kim-2218822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091613S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6407512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6407512","articleId":"6307861","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6307865,"authors":[{"name":"Deli Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Deli Qiao received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, US, in 2012.

It is assumed that there is no direct link between the source and the destination, and the relay forwards the information to the destination by employing the decode-and-forward scheme. Both the source and intermediate relay nodes are assumed to operate under statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints imposed as limitations on the buffer overflow probabilities. The maximum constant arrival rates that can be supported by this two-hop link in the presence of QoS constraints are characterized by determining the effective capacity of such links as a function of the QoS parameters and signal-to-noise ratios at the source and relay, and the fading distributions of the links. The analysis is performed for both full-duplex and half-duplex relaying. Through this study, the impact upon the throughput of having buffer constraints at the source and intermediate relay nodes is identified. The interactions between the buffer constraints in different nodes and how they affect the performance are studied. The optimal time-sharing parameter in half-duplex relaying is determined, and performance with half-duplex relaying is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2219850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06307865.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2219850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Capacity of Two-Hop Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Effective Capacity of Two-Hop Wireless Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307865/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13234709","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6307865/","volume":"59","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Capacity of Two-Hop Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tit-gursoy-2219850-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102069S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6307865","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6307869,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni I.

In this study, the s.c. glucose prediction is treated as a multivariate regression problem, which is addressed using support vector regression (SVR). The proposed method is based on variables concerning: 1) the s.c. glucose profile; 2) the plasma insulin concentration; 3) the appearance of meal-derived glucose in the systemic circulation; and 4) the energy expenditure during physical activities. Six cases corresponding to different combinations of the aforementioned variables are used to investigate the influence of the input on the daily glucose prediction. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset of 27 patients in free-living conditions. Tenfold cross validation is applied to each dataset individually to both optimize and test the SVR model. In the case, where all the input variables are considered, the average prediction errors are 5.21, 6.03, 7.14, and 7.62 mg/dl for 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min prediction horizons, respectively. The results clearly indicate that the availability of multivariable data and their effective combination can significantly increase the accuracy of both short-term and long-term predictions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13785934","pubMedId":"23008265","htmlLink":"/document/6307869/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multivariate Prediction of Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Type 1 Diabetes Patients Based on Support Vector Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariate Prediction of Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration in Type 1 Diabetes Patients Based on Support Vector Regression","sourcePdf":"jbhi-polyzos-2219876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13182S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6331301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6331301","articleId":"6307869","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6307881,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Dong","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6341145/6307881/6307881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Dong (S'09) received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2009, both in electrical engineering, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Center for Power Electronics Systems.","His research interests include modeling and control of single-phase to multiphase power converters, high power converter design for utility application, passive components and electromagnetic interference filter design, and the system integration design for renewable energy systems and dc power distribution systems."]},"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Dong","id":"37588136900"},{"name":"Fang Luo","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6341145/6307881/6307881-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Luo (S'06\u2013M'10) received the Bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003 and 2010, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been with the Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, as a Visiting Student, supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council and CPES.

The power-allocation solution depends on long-term channel statistics and system parameters and hence can be used in practice. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed power-allocation technique by comparing it with equal power allocation (EPA) between nodes and symbols and with well-known and recently derived capacity performance benchmarks.

To this end, this work proposes and optimizes channel-dependent training schemes for reciprocal Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels with beamforming (BF) at the transmitter and receiver. First, assuming that Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the receiver, a channel-dependent Reverse Channel Training (RCT) signal is proposed that enables efficient estimation of the BF vector at the transmitter with a minimum training duration of only one symbol. In contrast, conventional orthogonal training requires a minimum training duration equal to the number of receive antennas. A tight approximation to the capacity lower bound on the system is derived, which is used as a performance metric to optimize the parameters of the RCT. Next, assuming that CSI is available at the transmitter, a channel-dependent forward-link training signal is proposed and its power and duration are optimized with respect to an approximate capacity lower bound. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the significant performance improvement offered by the proposed channel-dependent training schemes over the existing channel-agnostic orthogonal training schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Training Signal Design for Reciprocal Multiple Antenna Systems With Beamforming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2219631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06307896.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2219631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6307896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Channel Training Signal Design for Reciprocal Multiple Antenna Systems With Beamforming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6307896/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219891","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Training Signal Design for Reciprocal Multiple Antenna Systems With Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-murthy-2219631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092778S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6410063","articleId":"6307896","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6307899,"authors":[{"name":"Aimin Jiang","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou Campus, Changzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6403532/6307899/6307899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aimin Jiang (S'07\u2013M'11) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.","He was an Associate Professor since 2011 and was promoted to a Professor in June, 2012 at the College of Computer and Information Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou Campus, Changzhou.

The objective of the sparse digital filter design problem considered in this paper is to reduce the number of nonzero-valued filter coefficients, subject to a weighted least-squares (WLS) approximation error constraint imposed on the frequency domain. The proposed design method is inspired by the iterative shrinkage/thresholding (IST) algorithms, which are used in sparse and redundant representation for signals. The basic idea of the proposed design algorithm is to successively transform the original nonconvex problem to a series of constrained subproblems in a simpler form. Despite of their nonconvexity, these subproblems can be efficiently and reliably solved in each iterative step by a numerical approach developed in this paper. Furthermore, it can be demonstrated that the obtained solutions are essentially optimal to their respective subproblems. Since its major part only involves scalar operations, the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient. Three sets of numerical examples are presented in this paper to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6403532/06307899.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"135","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WLS Design of Sparse FIR Digital Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"WLS Design of Sparse FIR Digital Filters","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6307899/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13196190","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6307899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WLS Design of Sparse FIR Digital Filters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kwan-2215742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111341S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6403532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6403532","articleId":"6307899","onlineDate":"19 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6307989,"authors":[{"name":"Benyoucef Othmane","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Informatique, Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et de la Technologie d'Oran Mohammed Boudiaf, Oran, Algeria"],"firstName":"Benyoucef","lastName":"Othmane","id":"38481750500"},{"name":"Rahal Sidi Ahmed Hebri","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Informatique, Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et de la Technologie d'Oran Mohammed Boudiaf, Oran, Algeria"],"firstName":"Rahal Sidi Ahmed","lastName":"Hebri","id":"38486516800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-7138-26-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-7138-25-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2762"}],"articleNumber":"6307989","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Distributed databases","Multiagent systems","Parallel processing","Data visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining","distributed processing","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multiagent systems","distributed data mining","DDM","research topics","information systems","networks connectivity","data volume","modern computerization","resource distribution","agent based system","cloud service archictecture","SaaS architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Data mining","Cloud Computing","Multi-Agent Systems"]}],"abstract":"The distributed data mining (DDM) become one of the major research topics in information systems over the few past years, after the growth of the networks connectivity, and the data volume as well.

But the displacement error is conducted for the inherent hysteretic nonlinear characteristics, and the tracking precision is limited. A modified modeling method combining the neural network with the genetic algorithm (GA) is designed in this paper to improve the modeling performance. The mechanical structure is analyzed, and a Bouc-Wen model is introduced to express the nonlinear kinetics. A three-layer neural network is applied to identify the parameters including the weight and threshold values by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. GA is used to achieve the optimized solution of the network parameters. The data pairs including actuating voltage and corresponding displacement are regarded as the samples to train the network off-line. A low frequency triangle voltage with variable amplitude is applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the mean positioning error is reduced from 0.39\u03bcm to 0.24\u03bcm, and the maximum error from 0.76\u03bcm to 0.33\u03bcm respectively compared with the static neural network. A more accurate model is established for the control system design in the future.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2012.6308185","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6298752/6308132/06308185.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2012.6308185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of piezoelectric actuator based on genetic neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Hysteresis","Piezoelectric actuators","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","genetic algorithms","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","piezoelectric actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric actuator","genetic neural network","precision positioning mechanism","response frequency","genetic algorithm","GA","Bouc-Wen model","nonlinear kinetics","control system design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Piezoelectric actuator","Micro displacement","Precision tracking","Neural network","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of piezoelectric actuator based on genetic neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6308185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13000323","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of piezoelectric actuator based on genetic neural network","confLoc":"Zhengzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057459S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6298752","isNumber":"6308132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6298752","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6308132","articleId":"6308185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6308225,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Qingdao Technological University, Qingdao, Shandong, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537299600"},{"name":"Chengjin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Chengjin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288983600"},{"name":"Zhen Qin","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Qingdao Technological University, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Qin","id":"37085641931"},{"name":"Qiang Wei","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Electronics, Taishan University, Taian, Shandong, China","School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37544480700"},{"name":"Suzhen Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Qingdao Technological University, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Suzhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066694600"},{"name":"Limin Quan","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Qingdao Technological University, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Quan","id":"38482989700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0364-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0362-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0363-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-8151"}],"articleNumber":"6308225","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308225","abstract":"Double sigmoid activation function is adopted to improve the BP neural networks to build the piezo-stage's on-line identification model.

Flexure hinges have more advantages than conventional hinges with advantages of no friction, no backlash, high precision and high stiffness. In this paper, design and analysis of the two degrees of freedom flexure-hinges based micro-stage are performed. The lever amplified principle is used, which has a lot of superiorities for applying to the micro-stage through amplifying the displacement of the piezoelectric actuator (PZT) to obtain a lager output displacement at the stage's end-effector. The ANSYS software version 10.0 is exploited to analyze the displacement and natural frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6308243/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13000380","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparative analysis of a 2-dof micro-stage with two different types of hinges based on level amplified principle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative analysis of a 2-dof micro-stage with two different types of hinges based on level amplified principle","confLoc":"Zhengzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044382S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6298752","isNumber":"6308132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6298752","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6308132","articleId":"6308243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6308254,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The batteries are divided into groups and connected to DC bus via charging circuits. The state-of-charge of each battery connected is monitored and managed online by DSP TMS320F28335. A bidirectional DC/DC converter is also connected to DC bus, in parallel with charge/discharge circuit, to supply power for DC load or grid through a three-phase inverter.

In the framework of rough set, an approach of discernibility matrix and function is the theoretical foundation of finding reducts. In this paper, sample pair selection with rough set is proposed in order to compress the discernibility function of a decision table so that only minimal elements in the discernibility matrix are employed to find reducts.

The Gaussian vertex plate has been applied at the center of the reflector in order to improve the reflection coefficient and reduce the far-out sidelobes. A parabolic reflector with a ring-shaped focus has been designed for obtaining nearly 100% phase efficiency. The antenna's reflection coefficient is below -17 dB and the radiation patterns satisfy the M-x standard co- and cross-polar sidelobe envelopes for satellite ground stations over a bandwidth of 30%. A low-cost monolayer radome has been designed for the antenna with satisfactory performance.

The surface consists of a periodic, subwavelength-patterned metallic cladding printed over a grounded dielectric substrate. First, the dispersion equation for an idealized tensor impedance boundary condition is derived by expressing the field in terms of TE and TM waves. A similar method is then used to find the dispersion equation of the PCTIS consisting of a tensor sheet impedance, which models the metallic cladding, over a grounded dielectric substrate. In addition, a method for extracting the tensor sheet impedance of a periodic, metallic cladding printed over a grounded dielectric substrate, is reported. It involves performing two normal-incidence scattering simulations using a full-wave electromagnetic solver. The method is strictly valid when the ground plane is sufficiently far from the metallic cladding to avoid evanescent-wave interactions. By combining the tensor sheet extraction method with the dispersion equation, the full dispersion characteristics of the PCTIS are analytically predicted in the homogenous limit. The results are verified through full-wave eigenmode simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2220092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6397624/06308707.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2220092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397624","startPage":"211","endPage":"220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Printed-Circuit Tensor Impedance Surfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Printed-Circuit Tensor Impedance Surfaces","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13191183","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6308707/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Printed-Circuit Tensor Impedance Surfaces","sourcePdf":"tap-patel-2220092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059533S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6397624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6397624","articleId":"6308707","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6308708,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Peng","affiliation":["The ElectroScience Laboratory, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6397624/6308708/6308708-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Peng (M'09) received the B.S. in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese Academy of Science, in 2008.","From 2008 to 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the ElectroScience Laboratory in the Ohio State University.

It is important to understand the relationship between these effects and the output power of the PV array. This paper presents a MATLAB-Simulink-based PV module model which includes a controlled current source and an S-Function builder. The modeling scheme in S-Function builder is deduced by some predigested functions. Under the conditions of nonuniform irradiance, the model is practically validated by using different array configurations in testing platform. The comparison experiments indicate that I-V and P-V characteristic curves of simulation match the measurements from outdoor experiment well. Under the conditions of nonuniform irradiance, both simulation and experiment show that the output power of a PV array gets more complicated due to multiple peaks. Moreover, the proposed model can also simulate electric circuit and its maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in the environment of MATLAB-Simulink. The experiments show that the proposed model has good predictability in the general behaviors of MPPT under the conditions of both nonuniform and uniform irradiance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","volume":"27","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13136476","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6308713/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A MATLAB-Simulink-Based PV Module Model and Its Application Under Conditions of Nonuniform Irradiance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MATLAB-Simulink-Based PV Module Model and Its Application Under Conditions of Nonuniform Irradiance","sourcePdf":"tec-ding-2216529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087052S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6340605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"6340605","articleId":"6308713","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6308721,"authors":[{"name":"Bianca Lassen","affiliation":["Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bianca","lastName":"Lassen","id":"37972170700"},{"name":"Eva M. van Rikxoort","affiliation":["Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany","Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Department of Radiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Eva M.","lastName":"van Rikxoort","id":"37392866300"},{"name":"Michael Schmidt","affiliation":["Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"38547184900"},{"name":"Sjoerd Kerkstra","affiliation":["Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Department of Radiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sjoerd","lastName":"Kerkstra","id":"38548022100"},{"name":"Bram van Ginneken","affiliation":["Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Department of Radiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bram","lastName":"van Ginneken","id":"37271824900"},{"name":"Jan-Martin Kuhnigk","affiliation":["Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan-Martin","lastName":"Kuhnigk","id":"37300362200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"6308721","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308721","abstract":"Segmentation of the pulmonary lobes is relevant in clinical practice and particularly challenging for cases with severe diseases or incomplete fissures. In this work, an automated segmentation approach is presented that performs a marker-based watershed transformation on computed tomography (CT) scans to subdivide the lungs into lobes. A cost image for the watershed transformation is computed by combining information from fissures, bronchi, and pulmonary vessels. The lobar markers are calculated by an analysis of the automatically labeled bronchial tree. By integration of information from several anatomical structures the segmentation is made robust against incomplete fissures. For evaluation the method was compared to a recently published method on 20 CT scans with no or mild disease. The average distances to the reference segmentation were 0.69, 0.67, and 1.21 mm for the left major, right major, and right minor fissure, respectively. In addition the results were submitted to LOLA11, an international lung lobe segmentation challenge with publically available data including cases with severe diseases. The average distances to the reference for the 55 CT scans provided by LOLA11 were 0.98, 3.97, and 3.09 mm for the left major, right major, and right minor fissure. Moreover, an analysis of the relation between segmentation quality and fissure completeness showed that the method is robust against incomplete fissures.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2012.2219881","startPage":"210","endPage":"222","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6423975/06308721.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2012.2219881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Segmentation of the Pulmonary Lobes From Chest CT Scans Based on Fissures, Vessels, and Bronchi","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Computed tomography","Image segmentation","Diseases","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood vessels","computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","diseases","image segmentation","lung","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulmonary lobes automatic segmentation","chest computerised tomography scans","diseases","marker-based watershed transformation","lungs","pulmonary vessels","labeled bronchial tree","information integration","anatomical structures","LOLA11","international lung lobe segmentation","segmentation quality","fissure completeness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fissure segmentation","lung lobe segmentation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Lung","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Pulmonary Artery","Pulmonary Veins","Radiographic Image Enhancement","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Radiography, Thoracic","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Segmentation of the Pulmonary Lobes From Chest CT Scans Based on Fissures, Vessels, and Bronchi","volume":"32","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6308721/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13287678","pubMedId":"23014712","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Segmentation of the Pulmonary Lobes From Chest CT Scans Based on Fissures, Vessels, and Bronchi","sourcePdf":"tmi-lassen-2219881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128967S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6423975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6423975","articleId":"6308721","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6308726,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6479286/6308726/6308726-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Wang received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer software and theory from Wuhan University, Wuhan, in 2011.","He is currently a Lecturer with the Nanchang Institute of Technology, Nanchang, China.

Using tools from information theory and a hidden Markov model for the measurements, a new framework is presented that abstracts both the privacy and the utility requirements of smart meter data. This leads to a novel privacy-utility tradeoff problem with minimal assumptions that is tractable. For a stationary Gaussian model of the electricity load, it is shown that for a desired mean-square distortion (utility) measure between the measured and revealed data, the optimal privacy-preserving solution: i) exploits the presence of high-power but less private appliance spectra as implicit distortion noise, and ii) filters out frequency components with lower power relative to a distortion threshold; this approach encompasses many previously proposed approaches to smart meter privacy.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2211046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6517533/06308749.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2211046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6517533","startPage":"837","endPage":"846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Meter Privacy: A Theoretical Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart Meter Privacy: A Theoretical Framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13517678","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6308749/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Meter Privacy: A Theoretical Framework","sourcePdf":"tsg-sankar-2211046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081637S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6517533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"6517533","articleId":"6308749","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6308763,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Both the cogging torque and back-emf are normally calculated at open-circuit conditions. However, they are affected by the electric loading and magnetic saturation. This paper investigates the influence of the load conditions on the cogging torque and back-emf waveform by employing a frozen permeability finite element technique. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the rotor skew on the minimization of the cogging torque, thus torque ripple, is also highlighted. It is found that the cogging torque magnitude is significantly increased under load conditions due to more flux leakage through tooth tips. However, the more important issue is that the cogging torque periodicity also changes, thus the rotor skew technique becomes less effective. In addition, the back-emf waveform under load conditions contains more harmonics, which leads to more electromagnetic torque ripple. It is also proven that the cogging torque, back-emf harmonics and consequently the output torque ripple are effectively diminished if the machine is skewed by one actual cogging torque period, i.e., when the electrical loading influence is considered. The analysis results are supported by experimental measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2012.2201493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6308754/06308763.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2012.2201493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308754","startPage":"2650","endPage":"2658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Electric Loading and Magnetic Saturation on Cogging Torque, Back-EMF and Torque Ripple of PM Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Electric Loading and Magnetic Saturation on Cogging Torque, Back-EMF and Torque Ripple of PM Machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030583","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6308763/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Electric Loading and Magnetic Saturation on Cogging Torque, Back-EMF and Torque Ripple of PM Machines","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhu-2201493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074803S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6308754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"6308754","articleId":"6308763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6308765,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

These applications and services often impose multifarious resource demands (storage, compute power, bandwidth, latency) on the underlying infrastructure. Existing data center architectures lack the flexibility to effectively support these applications, which results in poor support of QoS, deployability, manageability, and defence against security attacks. Data center network virtualization is a promising solution to address these problems. Virtualized data centers are envisioned to provide better management flexibility, lower cost, scalability, better resources utilization, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a survey of the current state-of-the-art in data center networks virtualization, and provide a detailed comparison of the surveyed proposals. We discuss the key research challenges for future research and point out some potential directions for tackling the problems related to data center design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2013","volume":"15","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13475588","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6308765/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data Center Network Virtualization: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Center Network Virtualization: A Survey","sourcePdf":"19Bari43.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112869S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6512259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"416","xplore-issue":"6512259","articleId":"6308765","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6308767,"authors":[{"name":"Guowei Yang","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel, \u00c9cole Centrale Marseille, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Guowei","lastName":"Yang","id":"38481139600"},{"name":"Mohammad-Ali Khalighi","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel, \u00c9cole Centrale Marseille, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Mohammad-Ali","lastName":"Khalighi","id":"37294707300"},{"name":"Salah Bourennane","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel, \u00c9cole Centrale Marseille, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Salah","lastName":"Bourennane","id":"37285089400"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6308767","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":799},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Fading","Bit error rate","Optical fiber communication","Correlation","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","fading channels","gamma distribution","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlated gamma-gamma variates","near-ground free-space optical communication","FSO communication system","dual space diversity FSO systems","fading coefficients","receiver performance","correlated \u0393\u0393 random variables","\u03b1-\u03bc distribution","approximate \u03b1-\u03bc model","\u0393\u0393 channel model","received intensity fluctuations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gamma-gamma distribution","free-space optics (FSO)","spatial diversity","correlated fading","\u03b1-\u03bc distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308767","abstract":"The Gamma-Gamma (\u0393\u0393) distribution is popularly accepted for modeling the received intensity fluctuations in the near-ground free-space optical (FSO) communication.

The novelty of the research is that a closed-form Femto-cell placement expression has been derived, which can maximize the throughput of the indoor building given knowledge of a few key statistical network parameters. The benefit compared to blind placement is that it can achieve a throughput improvement of 20 to 50%. The solution has a high placement error tolerance of 10% of building size. Another benefit is that the optimal solution can maintain an approximately constant level of throughput, irrespective of the indoor building size.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Aware Self-Deploying Femto-Cell","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.091312.120576","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6376570/06308771.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.091312.120576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Aware Self-Deploying Femto-Cell","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6308771/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13167871","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-Aware Self-Deploying Femto-Cell","sourcePdf":"609-wcl1212-guo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035748S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6376570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6376570","articleId":"6308771","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6308772,"authors":[{"name":"Sachitha Kusaladharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Sachitha","lastName":"Kusaladharma","id":"38526153200"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6308772","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":922},"abstract":"This paper investigates the aggregate interference on a primary user caused by a random number of cognitive radio transmitters distributed in a finite ring.

In this paper, we study resource allocation in open access OFDMA femtocell networks to guarantee QoS of the neighboring macrocell user (MU) in Dead Zone and limit cross-tier interference to other MUs. A new resource allocation method is proposed to improve performance of both neighboring MU and femtocell users (FU). In specific, the subchannel set originally assigned to the MU may overlap the subchannel set occupied by FAP and cause cross-tier interference. The overlapped subchannel set is freed by macro base station (MBS) after MU resigns and joins the nearby femtocell. Then the subchannel and power resources in the femtocell are re-allocated. We leverage cognitive radio (CR) technology in femtocell networks and propose an asymptotically optimal resource allocation algorithm using dual decomposition methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm for the open access scheme can achieve higher transmission rate in contrast to the closed access scheme.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.091312.120394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6376570/06308774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.091312.120394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376570","startPage":"625","endPage":"628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in Open Access OFDMA Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Open Access OFDMA Femtocell Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13167874","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6308774/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Open Access OFDMA Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"625-wcl1212-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056071S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6376570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6376570","articleId":"6308774","onlineDate":"20 September 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6308794,"authors":[{"name":"Mengling Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Optimization for Chemical Processes of Ministry of Education, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Mengling Wang","id":"37087378453"},{"name":"Hongbo Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Optimization for Chemical Processes of Ministry of Education, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Hongbo Shi","id":"37087378068"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1411-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1410-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1409-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6308794","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Sensor systems","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","partial differential equations","reduced order systems","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal reduction method","spatially distributed system","simulated annealing","partial differential equation","optimal region division","computational complexity","optimal model reduction","iterative optimizing method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatially-distributed system","model reduction","simulated annealing","local modeling approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308794","abstract":"For partial differential equation description unknown spatially distributed systems, the number of local models determines the dimension of the model.

3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced as the uplink multiple access scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel lattice reduction aided (LRA) detector in frequency domain for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SC-FDMA system, which can achieve more diversity than the traditional linear frequency-domain equalizer. On the other hand, the computation complexity can be reduced by decreasing the dimension of the matrix executing LR operation and exploring the correlation between channel matrixes in adjacent tones. Simulation results show that LRA detector has the significant performance advantage comparing with the traditional linear equalizer when channel has LOS path, especially for the system with more antennas.","doi":"10.1109/CSIP.2012.6308804","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297597/6308775/06308804.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIP.2012.6308804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308775","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A lattice reduction aided detection for MIMO SC-FDMA in LTE/LTE-A system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A lattice reduction aided detection for MIMO SC-FDMA in LTE/LTE-A system","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308804/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13039109","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6308804/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lattice reduction aided detection for MIMO SC-FDMA in LTE/LTE-A system","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"APART029ES2423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059597S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297597","isNumber":"6308775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297597","xplore-issue":"6308775","articleId":"6308804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6308828,"authors":[{"name":"Jifu Nong","affiliation":["College of Science, Guangxi University for Nationalities, Nanning, China"],"lastName":"Jifu Nong","id":"37541520300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1411-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1410-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1409-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6308828","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Hafnium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","numerical analysis","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constructive neural networks","regression models","regression problem","feedforward NN","FNN","one hidden layer feedforward neural networks","OHL-FNNs","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["constructive neural networks","network pruning","training strategy","regression models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308828","abstract":"Regression problem is an important application area for neural networks (NNs). Among a large number of existing NN architectures, the feedforward NN (FNN) paradigm is one of the most widely used structures. Although one-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (OHL-FNNs) have simple structures, they possess interesting representational and learning capabilities. In this paper, we are interested particularly in incremental constructive training of OHL-FNNs. In the proposed incremental constructive training schemes for an OHL-FNN, input-side training and output-side training may be separated in order to reduce the training time. A new technique is proposed to scale the error signal during the constructive learning process to improve the input-side training efficiency and to obtain better generalization performance. Two pruning methods for removing the input-side redundant connections have also been applied. Numerical simulations demonstrate the potential and advantages of the proposed strategies when compared to other existing techniques in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/CSIP.2012.6308828","startPage":"197","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIP.2012.6308828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308775","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297597/6308775/06308828.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategies for constructive neural networks and its application to regression models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308828/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Strategies for constructive neural networks and its application to regression models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6308828/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13039133","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategies for constructive neural networks and its application to regression models","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"APART053ES2465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13103S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297597","isNumber":"6308775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297597","xplore-issue":"6308775","articleId":"6308828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6308834,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["College of Science, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yang Liu","id":"38474378100"},{"name":"Yuena Ma","affiliation":["College of Science, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yuena Ma","id":"38123983700"},{"name":"Ruihu Li","affiliation":["College of Science, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Ruihu Li","id":"37280238300"},{"name":"Youqian Feng","affiliation":["College of Science, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Youqian Feng","id":"37067932100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1411-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1410-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1409-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6308834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6308834","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","quantum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imprimitive BCH codes","quantum codes","prime power","q-ary narrow-sense BCH codes","nonnarrow-sense BCH codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cyclotomic coset","BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) codes","dual codes","quantum codes"]}],"abstract":"Let q be a prime power, l \u2265 2 be even, n=(q-1)(q\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">il</sup>\n-1)/(q\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sup>\n-1).

In low dimensional space, piecewise decreasing mutation had obvious advantage at the convergence accuracy and evolution velocity.","doi":"10.1109/CSIP.2012.6308869","startPage":"364","endPage":"368","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIP.2012.6308869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308775","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297597/6308775/06308869.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Family Particle Swarm Optimization with piecewise mutation probability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6308869/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Family Particle Swarm Optimization with piecewise mutation probability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6308869/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13039174","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Family Particle Swarm Optimization with piecewise mutation probability","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"APART094ES2518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059824S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297597","isNumber":"6308775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297597","xplore-issue":"6308775","articleId":"6308869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6308871,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyan Qu","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Digital Audio and Video, Ministry of Education (ECDA V), Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yanyan Qu","id":"38476178100"},{"name":"Zhengxiang Li","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Digital Audio and Video, Ministry of Education (ECDA V), Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhengxiang Li","id":"37984629300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1411-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1410-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1409-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6308871","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency synchronization","Frequency conversion","Frequency estimation","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","estimation theory","OFDM modulation","redundancy","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio mondiale system","DRM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency synchronization","timing synchronization","symbol timing estimation","fractional frequency offset estimation","DRM receiving signal","cyclic prefix","OFDM symbols","redundancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","synchronization","DRM","ML","cyclic prefix"]}],"abstract":"Based on the Digital Radio Mondiale(DRM) System specification, symbol timing and fractional frequency offset estimation for DRM receiving signal are achieved with the aid of cyclic prefix within the OFDM symbols.

Many approaches such as clipping and filtering, coding, SLM, PTS, and tone reservation (TR) have been studied to reduce the peak magnitude of OFDM symbols. In these approaches, tone reservation method constructs an additive PAPR reduction signal that uses a small subset of reserved subcarriers. These reserved tones are orthogonal with the data tones and, hence, cause no additional distortion, no side information, and low implementation cost. However, TR schemes with oversample or not affects PAPR reduction performance significantly. TR schemes without oversample would bring peak value up again easily when pass by HPA and then bring out-of-band (OOB) distortion. In this paper, we evaluated proposed TR scheme with oversample in OFDM systems and focused on the effects of oversample technique to our proposed system. The simulation results show that the scheme can provide good performance and fast convergence.","doi":"10.1109/CSIP.2012.6309061","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6297597/6308775/06309061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIP.2012.6309061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308775","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of oversample in tone reservation scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of oversample in tone reservation scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309061/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13055255","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6309061/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of oversample in tone reservation scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"APART286SP245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0446S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6297597","isNumber":"6308775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6297597","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6308775","articleId":"6309061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6309071,"authors":[{"name":"Kong Fancheng","affiliation":["Xuzhou Air Force College, Xuzhou, China"],"lastName":"Kong Fancheng","id":"38477005600"},{"name":"He Guoliang","affiliation":["Xuzhou Air Force College, Xuzhou, China"],"lastName":"He Guoliang","id":"38479867000"},{"name":"Geng Guanglong","affiliation":["Xuzhou Air Force College, Xuzhou, China"],"lastName":"Geng Guanglong","id":"38485754700"},{"name":"Liu Tao","affiliation":["Xuzhou Air Force College, Xuzhou, China"],"lastName":"Liu Tao","id":"38474383700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1411-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1410-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1409-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6309071","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Educational institutions","Pattern matching","Current measurement","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","image recognition","Kalman filters","military computing","missile guidance","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infrared image recognition","target character prediction","air-air missile","weighted average method","Kalman filter","molding board","pattern match method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["infrared image","target recognition","eigenvalue","prediction","Kalman filtering"]}],"abstract":"Aimed at the prevalent phenomenon that it compute too many number and run slowly while infrared imaging air-air missile recognize targets, presented the algorithm that pattern match recognition applied character prediction.

The paper discusses different types of mobile-phone antennas, feeding structures, active antennas, isolation, and antenna loading techniques. This paper examines different design techniques for mobile-phone antennas, and the limitations of antenna design due to manufacturing technologies and the effect of handset materials. Antenna performance parameters, including S parameters, radiation efficiency, SAR, and TRP/TIS are reported for the surveyed handsets. The effective antenna volume for every antenna is calculated, in order to determine the average volume/space required for each antenna type and the corresponding performance. Some of the handsets are further simulated using commercial electromagnetic simulators to illustrate the electromagnetic-field distributions. This paper summarizes the antenna design parameters as a function of handset performance, and presents a short summary of design procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6309152/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13012832","volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mobile-Phone Antenna Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile-Phone Antenna Design","sourcePdf":"AP1434Rowell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11601S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"6309141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6309141","articleId":"6309152","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6309153,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Costa","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Costa","id":"37401434100"},{"name":"Agostino Monorchio","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Monorchio","id":"37277494100"},{"name":"Giuliano Manara","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuliano","lastName":"Manara","id":"37277485200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9243"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4143"}],"articleNumber":"6309153","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":208,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8021},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309153","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface impedance","Resonant frequency","Metamaterials","Surface waves","Dielectrics","Moment methods","Equivalent circuits","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","coupled circuits","coupled transmission lines","equivalent circuits","frequency selective surfaces","LC circuits","linear network analysis","lumped parameter networks","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simple equivalent-circuit model","FSS","first-order circuit approach","approximation analysis","lumped-LC-network","lumped parameter computation","frequency-selective-surface element","LC coupling storage","dielectric slab","equivalent transmission line","MoM simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical models","frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)","electromagnetic propagation","equivalent circuits","metamaterials","sheet materials"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MAP.2012.6309153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/6309141/06309153.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2012.6309153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Analysis of Frequency-Selective Surfaces by a Simple Equivalent-Circuit Model","abstract":"The transmission and reflection properties of frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) are evaluated through a simple and accurate first-order circuit approach. The approximate analysis, based on the parallel between real structure and a lumped-LC-network counterpart, is also useful for acquiring physical insights into the working principles of frequency-selective surfaces. The first part of the paper describes a technique for computing lumped parameters of the most common frequency-selective-surface elements. The L and C parameters representing a given frequency-selective-surface element are derived only one time, at normal incidence, and stored, so as to form a database. The second part of the paper deals with the derivation of simple relations allowing the generalization of the stored LC couples in the case where the frequency-selective surface is printed or embedded in arbitrarily thick dielectric slabs, when the incident angle is varied from normal incidence, or if a different periodicity with respect to the reference periodicity is adopted. The generalized lumped parameters are included in an equivalent transmission line for computing the response of generic frequency-selective-surface configurations with no additional computational effort. The results obtained through the simplified model presented here are verified by a careful comparison with MoM simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6309153/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2012","accessionNumber":"13012833","volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Analysis of Frequency-Selective Surfaces by a Simple Equivalent-Circuit Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Analysis of Frequency-Selective Surfaces by a Simple Equivalent-Circuit Model","sourcePdf":"AP3448Costa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129699S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"6309141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"6309141","articleId":"6309153","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6309161,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/6309141/6309161/6309161-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Chen received the BE from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1986, and the ME and DE from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1991 and 1994, respectively.

As a single antenna usually has a size of a few square millimeters, the feeding scheme can't be as simple as a connector, especially if high measurement accuracy is needed. That's why a microelectronic probe-feeding technique is a possible improvement. However, the final choice depends on the antenna technology, and also on the way the antenna is integrated. On-chip antennas using silicon substrates, or antennas integrated into ceramics or organic packages, are today the most popular solutions, the latter being the most efficient. The measurement setup we present has been developed from a classical microelectronic-probe measurement setup, but has been mechanically modified to operate in almost a metal-free environment, especially around the antenna under test (AUT). It is then possible to measure the gain of linearly and circularly polarized radiators in several cut planes with a computed accuracy of \u00b10.8 dB at 60 GHz. It is also possible to measure the radiated field over a quasi-three-dimensional sphere, the microelectronic probe being the only object blocking the electromagnetic waves transmitted by the AUT. Therefore, several methods have been implemented to be able to compute the axial ratio, and the total and radiation efficiencies from these radiation measurements. Several examples are presented in this paper to demonstrate the capabilities of the setup.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2012.6309179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/6309141/06309179.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2012.6309179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309141","startPage":"188","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Millimeter-Wave Measurement Setup and Dedicated Techniques to Characterize the Matching and Radiation Performance of Probe-Fed Antennas [Measurements Corner]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Millimeter-Wave Measurement Setup and Dedicated Techniques to Characterize the Matching and Radiation Performance of Probe-Fed Antennas [Measurements Corner]","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13012840","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6309179/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Millimeter-Wave Measurement Setup and Dedicated Techniques to Characterize the Matching and Radiation Performance of Probe-Fed Antennas [Measurements Corner]","sourcePdf":"AP188203MeasurementCorner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093265S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"6309141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6309141","articleId":"6309179","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6309184,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The constantly growing passive RFID technology at ultra-high frequencies (UHF), in conjunction with current state-of-the-art information and communication technologies (ICTs), was used for the system design. The end product was installed at an oncology hospital in Cyprus, where it was thoroughly evaluated by medical staff and hospital administrators. This pilot project had three main objectives: a) automatic and error-free patient identification of in-hospital patients using RFID-enabled cards or wristbands; b) Real-time location service (RTLS) for locating and tracking medical assets and high-value equipment in the hospital ward; c) quick and hassle-free drug inventory management through the use of inexpensive smart labels and cost-effective stationary readers. Here, we present a detailed description of the three major subsystems of the pilot project, emphasizing the main features and capabilities of the system, important design and implementation issues, as well as system evaluation and testing. During the design stage of the project, special emphasis was placed on user friendliness, system capabilities, adequate coverage and tag readability, privacy and security of sensitive patient data, system reliability, and the daily practices of medical personnel and hospital administrators.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2012.6309198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/6309141/06309198.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2012.6309198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design, Installation, and Evaluation of a Radio-Frequency Identification System for Healthcare Applications [Wireless Corner]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309198/","displayDocTitle":"On the Design, Installation, and Evaluation of a Radio-Frequency Identification System for Healthcare Applications [Wireless Corner]","volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13012842","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6309198/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design, Installation, and Evaluation of a Radio-Frequency Identification System for Healthcare Applications [Wireless Corner]","sourcePdf":"AP255271WirelessCorner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061429S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"6309141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6309141","articleId":"6309198","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6309238,"authors":[{"name":"David Schneider","firstName":"David","lastName":"Schneider","id":"38482588200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"6309238","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Supercomputers"]}],"abstract":"A Texas team says digital signal processors could compete in high-performance computing. Building high performance computers used to be all about maximizing flops, or floating point operations per second.

Judged by that energy-efficiency metric, some digital-signal processing (DSP) chips - the sophisticated signal conditioners that run our wireless networks, among other things - might make promising building blocks for future supercomputers, recent research suggests.

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack. The proposed method was tested on an experimental smart grid system demonstrating enhanced cyber-security.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Symposium on Resilient Control

the past several decades Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) have become vital components of most modern buildings. BEMSs utilize advanced microprocessor technology combined with extensive sensor data collection and communication to minimize energy consumption while maintaining high human comfort levels. When properly tuned and operated, BEMSs can provide significant energy savings. However, the complexity of the acquired sensory data and the overwhelming amount of presented information renders them difficult to adjust or even understand by responsible building managers. This inevitably results in suboptimal BEMS operation and performance. To address this issue, this paper reports on a research effort that utilizes Computational Intelligence techniques to fuse multiple heterogeneous sources of BEMS data and to extract relevant actionable information. This actionable information can then be easily understood and acted upon by responsible building managers. In particular, this paper describes the use of anomaly detection algorithms for improving the understandability of BEMS data and for increasing the state-awareness of building managers. The developed system utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to automatically build a model of normal BEMS operations and detect possible anomalous behavior. In addition, linguistic summaries based on fuzzy set representation of the input values are generated for the detected anomalies which increase the understandability of the presented results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational intelligence based anomaly detection for Building Energy Management Systems","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309297","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6298765/6309281/06309297.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Computational intelligence based anomaly detection for Building Energy Management Systems","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6309297/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13016188","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational intelligence based anomaly detection for Building Energy Management Systems","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"0077bf000841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065107S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6298765","isNumber":"6309281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6298765","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6309281","articleId":"6309297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6309306,"authors":[{"name":"Emeka Eyisi","affiliation":["EECS Department, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Emeka","lastName":"Eyisi","id":"37704288100"},{"name":"Xenofon Koutsoukos","affiliation":["EECS Department, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Xenofon","lastName":"Koutsoukos","id":"37283549100"},{"name":"Nicholas Kottenstette","affiliation":["WW Technology Group, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Kottenstette","id":"37399404900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0163-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0161-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0162-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6309306","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Adaptive systems","Wireless networks","Manipulators","Mathematical model","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","delays","distributed control","networked control systems","radio networks","telecommunication control","time-varying systems","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passivity based trajectory tracking control","adaptive sampling","wireless network","time-varying delays","packet loss","networked control systems","NCS","network resources","network bandwidth","robotic manipulator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309306","doi":"10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309281","publicationTitle":"2012 5th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6298765/6309281/06309306.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passivity-based trajectory tracking control with adaptive sampling over a wireless network","abstract":"Uncertainty in wireless networks, such as time-varying delays and packet loss, often leads to instability and degraded performance in Networked Control Systems (NCS).

One of the major obstacles in implementing speech processing algorithms in WASN is the sampling rate offsets between the nodes. As nodes utilize individual clock sources, sampling rate offsets are inevitable and may cause severe performance degradation. In this paper, a blind procedure for estimating the sampling rate offsets is derived. The procedure is applicable to speech-absent time segments with slow time-varying interference statistics. The proposed procedure is based on the phase drift of the coherence between two signals sampled at different sampling rates. Resampling the signals with Lagrange polynomials interpolation method compensates for the sampling rate offsets. An extensive experimental study, utilizing the transfer function generalized sidelobe canceller (TFGSC), exemplifies the problem and its solution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309387","publicationTitle":"IWAENC 2012; International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement","displayPublicationTitle":"IWAENC 2012; International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309386/6309387/06309395.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Sampling Rate Offset Estimation and Compensation in Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks with Application to Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Blind Sampling Rate Offset Estimation and Compensation in Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks with Application to Beamforming","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309395/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Sampling Rate Offset Estimation and Compensation in Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks with Application to Beamforming","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"453451009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024757S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","isNumber":"6309387","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309386","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6309395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6309413,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zeng","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands Signal and Information Processing Lab"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zeng"},{"name":"Richard C.

In such cases, the applied speech enhancement algorithms should be capable of preserving the, so called, binaural cues. In this paper, a binaural extension of the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer is proposed. The proposed algorithm, denoted binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) beamformer, is capable of extracting desired speakers while suppressing interference speakers. The BLCMV maintains the binaural cues of both the desired and the interference sources in the constrained space. The ability of preserving the binaural cues makes the BLCMV beamformer particularly suitable for hearing aid applications. It is further proposed to obtain a reduced complexity implementation by sharing common blocks in both sides of the hearing aid device. The performance of the proposed method, in terms of imposed distortion, interference cancellation and cue preservation, is verified by an extensive experimental study using signals recorded by a dummy head in an actual room.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Binaural Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance Beamformer for Hearing Aid Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binaural Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance Beamformer for Hearing Aid Applications","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"453451029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024155S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","isNumber":"6309387","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309386","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6309415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6309418,"authors":[{"name":"Masoumeh Azarpour","firstName":"Masoumeh","lastName":"Azarpour"},{"name":"Gerald Enzner","firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Enzner"},{"name":"Rainer Martin","firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Martin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3451-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6309418","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortionless-Response vs. Matched-Filter-Array Processing for Adaptive Binaural Noise Reduction","abstract":"We present a binaural noise reduction algorithm based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) concept.

The second is a new joint adaptive algorithm, which is normalized by taking into account the difference in the numbers of the nonlinear and linear model parameters.

In many scenarios it is sufficient to assume that the microphones have an omnidirectional directivity pattern, a flat frequency response in the range of interest, and a 2D environment in which wavefronts propagate as a function of azimuth angle only. In this paper we consider a generalized solution for those cases in which one or more of these assumptions do not hold, yielding a beamformer that is optimized on measured directivity patterns as a function of azimuth, elevation and frequency. A comparative study is made with the 4-element cardioid microphone array employed in Microsoft Kinect for Windows, whose beamformer weights are calculated with directivity patterns using (a) 2D cardioid models, (b) 3D cardioid models and (c) 3D measurements. Results on a recorded noisy speech corpus show similar PESQ and speech recognition accuracy comparing (a) and (b), but a 50% relative improvement in word error rate using measured directivity patterns.

The message-passing algorithm performs generalized linear-coordinate descent (GLiCD) operations to exchange messages between neighboring microphone nodes, which converges increasingly fast as the noise correlation matrix becomes more and more diagonal. The algorithm makes use of a trade-off parameter which controls the off-diagonal energy of the noise correlation matrix. For the case the noise correlation matrix is truly diagonal, the performance of the GLiCD algorithm is equivalent to that of the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB).

We first propose a multichannel noise PSD matrix estimator that is based on the speech presence probability. To differentiate between desired and noise signals, we propose to control the a priori speech absence probability using an estimate of the direct to diffuse ratio (DDR). We then obtain an estimate of the desired signal using a parametric multichannel Wiener filter that allows a trade-off between noise reduction and speech distortion. We demonstrate that the noise reduction can be increased and the speech distortion can be decreased by controlling the trade-off parameter using the estimated DDR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6309445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2012","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MMSE-Based Blind Source Extraction in Diffuse Noise Fields Using a Complex Coherence-Based a Priori SAP Estimator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-Based Blind Source Extraction in Diffuse Noise Fields Using a Complex Coherence-Based a Priori SAP Estimator","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"453451059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021496S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2012","isNumber":"6309387","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6309386","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6309445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6309456,"authors":[{"name":"Yair Kerner","firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Kerner"},{"name":"Harry Lau","firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Lau"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3451-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6309456","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphones","Arrays","Gain","Vectors","Correlation","Noise","Array signal processing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two Microphone Array MVDR Beamforming with Controlled Beamwidth and Immunity to Gain Mismatch","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6309387","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IWAENC 2012; International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement","displayPublicationTitle":"IWAENC 2012; International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement","pdfPath":"/iel5/6309386/6309387/06309456.pdf","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6309456","abstract":"This paper deals with applications that accomplish spatial filtering using two element microphone arrays and employing Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beam-forming.

Among the abilities and complexity of a beamformer its performance also depends on the microphone array geometry. This paper highlights a major disadvantage in beamforming - a high sensitivity to reflections from the ceiling and the floor at frequencies above 2000 Hz- by using a horizontal uniform circular array with a center microphone in reverberant environments, e.g., a conference room, and a steering direction close to the array plane. Furthermore, it presents an improved beamformer and a planar array synthesized by a modified genetic algorithm, which exhibits a reduced sensitivity to floor and ceiling reflections and an improved directivity at lower frequencies in combination with a beamformer.","displayPublicationTitle":"Speech Communication; 10.
