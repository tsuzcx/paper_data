The system was implemented as a transputer-based vision system augmented with a high-speed correlation processor. The transputer vision board was equipped with three image frame memories, each of which could be used simultaneously for image input, image processing, and image display. Thus, the system could devote all its computation power to image processing without waiting for image input or display. The vision board was also equipped with a standard image compression chip, used as a correlation processor. Using the chip, a very fast correlation-based robot vision system was developed. This system can also be used as a multiprocessor configuration to greatly improve performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1992.220020","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/399/5764/00220020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1992.220020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1626 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot vision system with a correlation chip for real-time tracking, optical flow and depth map generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robot vision system with a correlation chip for real-time tracking, optical flow and depth map generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220020/","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4377438","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot vision system with a correlation chip for real-time tracking, optical flow and depth map generation","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00220020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03045S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"77","articleId":"220020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":220031,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The robot navigates from start to goal states by loosely following the skeleton. The resulting paths taken by the robot are of low complexity.

The crux of the approach is to plan the motion of each link, starting from the base link, sequentially, thereby solving n single-link problems. The authors present a backtracking mechanism for the motion planner to make it more effective in planning collision-free paths in cluttered situations. The level of backtracking k is an adjustable parameter. The time complexity of the algorithm is exponential in k, but is polynomial for a given k. In k, the level of backtracking, a user-determined parameter is provided, that can trade off computational speed versus the completeness of the planner. Experiments were conducted with up to ten degree-of-freedom manipulators in quite cluttered environments, and the planner successfully generated a collision-free path in the order of a few minutes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220115/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4368216","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning for many degrees of freedom: sequential search with backtracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning for many degrees of freedom: sequential search with backtracking","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00220115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033462S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"10","articleId":"220115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":220130,"authors":[{"name":"W.

To cope with this problem, the authors introduce active damping based on force sensor data. Linear active damping is introduced using the force derivative which is obtained either by means of filtered differentiation or by means of a state-space estimator, and both enable stable stiff contact. Nonlinear active damping through a feedforward method is introduced. The novel algorithm is simple and does not require knowledge of the contact stiffness. It enables satisfactory force response which is fast and without overshoot in the case of a high feedback gain with stiff contact.

The miniaturized tactile sensor consists of a hemispherical optical waveguide with an elastic cover, a fiber-optics plate (FOP), a position-sensitive detector (PSD), and infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for the light source. When an object comes in contact with the sensor, the elastic cover is depressed and light from the LEDs, which normally maintains total internal reflection within the waveguide, is scattered at the contact location of the waveguide and the cover. The scattered light is transmitted to the PSD through the FOP. The contact location and the normal to the surface of the object are determined from the output of the PSD.

In contrast to hierarchical methods, which assign a leadership hierarchy and a priori roles to different robots, the proposed approach attempts to detect and utilize the run-time group dynamics within the robot collective. The authors apply a distributed control approach both on the level of the individual robot and on the level of the colony. This choice involves a number of tradeoffs. The complexity of a traditional centralized planner is replaced by the complexity of inter-robot and inter-behavior dynamics. The authors explore methods for not only overcoming interference but utilizing those dynamics to achieve super-linear improvements in task performance. They report the results of testing this architecture on a collection of homogeneous mobile robots. The robots were tested on a number of tasks with a series of more intelligent and efficient local control strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4368139","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing complexity in controlling a mobile robot population","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing complexity in controlling a mobile robot population","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00220192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030183S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"84","articleId":"220192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":220225,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

A controllability analysis of the inverse kinematic system makes it possible to recover the well-known repeatability conditions of T. Shamir and Y. Yomdin (1988), and to further conclude that no null space velocity can be specified if a repeatable scheme is sought, unless it is chosen as a linear term in the end-effector velocity. The problem of achieving asymptotic cyclicity for a given inversion strategy has been solved via suitable kinematic controls, which guarantee convergence to cyclic joint trajectories along the desired end-effector path. Depending on the structure of the feedforward and feedback terms in the control law, a number of different schemes are proposed, yielding exact or asymptotic end-effector tracking. The stability proofs and the satisfactory simulation results confirm the advantage of using these simple control strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1992.220231","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/399/5764/00220231.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"506 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1992.220231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of redundant robots on cyclic trajectories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of redundant robots on cyclic trajectories","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4362928","publicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of redundant robots on cyclic trajectories","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00220231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044559S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"37","articleId":"220231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":220278,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This formulation uses the singularity robust inverse (SRI), which is effective in yielding feasible joint motions in single regions, in conjunction with a homogeneous-like joint velocity component to perform an additional subtask such as obstacle avoidance. This novel inverse kinematic scheme enables the manipulator to overcome singularities (or, more accurately, avoid infeasible joint motions at or near singular configurations) and avoid obstacles in addition to the main motion task. The attractive aspect of this scheme is that it results in the satisfaction of two subtasks without requiring two explicit subtask criteria. This is because one of the subtasks, i.e., feasible joint motion, is implicitly incorporated in the particular solution in the form of the SRI. As depicted in simulations, the proposed formulation proves to be an effective inverse kinematic solution in singular regions of the manipulator workspace.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4358964","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robot subtask performance with singularity robustness using optimal damped least-squares","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot subtask performance with singularity robustness using optimal damped least-squares","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00220301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031166S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"5764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"399","citationCount":"40","articleId":"220301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":220304,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

COPIS is a suitable sensor for visual navigation in the real-world environment with moving objects. The authors describe a method for estimating the location and the motion of the robot by detecting the azimuth of each object in the omnidirectional image. In this method, the azimuth is matched with the given environmental map. They also present a method to avoid collision against unknown obstacles and estimate their locations by detecting their azimuth changes while the robot is moving in the environment.

Control systems for critical plants, where operation must not be interrupted for safety reasons, are often configured with redundant sensing, computing, and actuating elements to provide fault tolerance and ensure the required degree of safety. In one such test case, the validation, selection and diagnosis of redundant sensor signals required 40%-50% of the control system hardware and software, while the control algorithms required less than 20% of these resources. Neural networks are investigated to determine if they can reduce the computational requirement and improve the performance of control system input signal management and diagnostics. Four neural networks are investigated to determine if they can reduce the computational requirement and improve the performance of control system input signal management and diagnostics. Four neural networks were trained to perform signal validation and selection of redundant sensors, sensor estimation from the data redundancy among dissimilar sensors, diagnostics, and estimation of unobservable control parameters. The performance of the neural networks are compared against plant models, and the results are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1992.220484","startPage":"923","endPage":"929 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference@m_NAECON 1992","pdfPath":"/iel2/655/5765/00220484.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference@m_NAECON 1992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1992.220484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for sensor management and diagnostics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control systems","Computer network management","Safety","Computer networks","Technology management","Fault tolerant systems","Software testing","System testing","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computerised control","detectors","fault tolerant computing","intelligent control","neural nets","redundancy","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor management","diagnostics","neural network","critical plants","safety","redundant sensing","fault tolerance","computational requirement","input signal management","signal validation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for sensor management and diagnostics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-22 May 1992","accessionNumber":"4395117","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for sensor management and diagnostics","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00220484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029127S","chronDate":"18-22 May 1992","isNumber":"5765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"655","citationCount":"3","articleId":"220484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":220485,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Long Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technique, Changsha Institute of Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Shu-Long Ji","id":"37088076738"},{"name":"Huangfu Kan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technique, Changsha Institute of Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Huangfu Kan","id":"37087374756"},{"name":"Zhong-Kang Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technique, Changsha Institute of Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Zhong-Kang Sun","id":"37087142978"},{"name":"Su-Zhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technique, Changsha Institute of Technology, ChangSha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Su-Zhi Li","id":"37088077799"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0652-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"220485","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220485","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Signal detection","Neural networks","Detectors","Phase detection","Frequency","Sun","Radar signal processing","Doppler radar","Books"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","radar theory","signal detection","signal processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally windowed 1D spectral coordinates","signal detection","CFAR","radar signals","Gabor transform","neural network","conjoint spatial/spectral transform","moving-target-detection","constant-false-alarm-rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1992.220485","pdfPath":"/iel2/655/5765/00220485.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference@m_NAECON 1992","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference@m_NAECON 1992","startPage":"916","endPage":"922 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1992.220485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of radar signals using Gabor transform and neural network","abstract":"The detection of a one-dimensional radar signal is attempted by using the Gabor transform and artificial neural networks (ANNs).

The two major tasks for this guidance system are the online recognition of a moving object invariant to rotation and translation, and tracking the moving object using a neural-network-driven vision system. This system included computer software ported to the IBM PC and interfaced with an IBM 7535 robot. The operation of this guidance system involved recognition of a moving object and the ability to track it till the robot and effector was in close proximity of the object. It was found that the robot was able to track a moving object as long as it did not leave the region visible to the camera. Recognition was successfully demonstrated for objects of arbitrary shapes. Even similarly shaped objects of different sizes were correctly recognized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1992.220491","startPage":"883","endPage":"886 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference@m_NAECON 1992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1992.220491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference@m_NAECON 1992","pdfPath":"/iel2/655/5765/00220491.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving object recognition and guidance of robots using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220491/","displayDocTitle":"Moving object recognition and guidance of robots using neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4395110","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-22 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving object recognition and guidance of robots using neural networks","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00220491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033076S","chronDate":"18-22 May 1992","isNumber":"5765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"655","articleId":"220491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":220606,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoda Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoda Zhu","id":"37087142293"},{"name":"Zhishu She","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhishu She","id":"37087598819"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0652-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"220606","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Radar applications","Radar antennas","Radar imaging","Doppler radar","Signal resolution","Spatial resolution","Matched filters","Radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","array signal processing","computational complexity","Doppler effect","ground support systems","image processing","neural nets","radar systems","radar theory","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superresolution radars","radar detection","multiple targets","array processing","superresolution range-Doppler imaging","aircraft","boeing-727","computational complexity","artificial neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220606","abstract":"The concept of superresolution radars is demonstrated in the context of radar detection of multiple targets using array processing and superresolution range-Doppler imaging of a commercial aircraft, the boeing-727.

The most essential requirement for the process technologies is the simultaneous fulfilment of the three principles of ultraclean technology: ultraclean wafer surface, ultraclean processing environment, and perfect process-parameter control. The growth of high-crystallinity silicon epitaxial layers at temperatures as low as 250 degrees C with accompanying in situ impurity doping as a result of optimizing pertinent process parameters in a low-kinetic-energy particle process is described. Advanced copper metallization for large-current driving interconnect formation is discussed. Ultraclean oxidation, which is characterized by native-oxide-free and surface-microroughness-free oxidation, is confirmed to form high-quality very thin oxide films ranging from 5 to 10 nm with complete uniformity. A low-temperature annealing ion implantation that makes practical a metal gate self-aligned MOS LSI, which is crucial for high-speed CMOS having high current driving capability, is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.220903","startPage":"716","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/5770/00220903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.220903","endPage":"729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ULSI reliability through ultraclean processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"ULSI reliability through ultraclean processing","volume":"81","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4481896","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ULSI reliability through ultraclean processing","sourcePdf":"00220903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10973S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"5770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"33","articleId":"220903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":220904,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Its performance, however, could only be evaluated via expensive Monte Carlo simulations. An effective hybrid approach to the performance evaluation without recourse to simulations is presented. This approach is based on a scenario-conditional performance measure of hybrid nature in the sense that it is a continuous-valued matrix function of a discrete-valued random sequence-the system mode sequence. This system mode sequence is an essential description of the scenario of the problem of interest on which the performance of the algorithm is to be predicted. The performance measure is calculated efficiently in an offline recursion. The ability of this approach to predict accurately the average performance of the algorithm is illustrated via two important examples: a generic air traffic control tracking problem and a nonstationary noise identification problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.220926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5771","startPage":"755","endPage":"771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/5771/00220926.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance prediction of the interacting multiple model algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance prediction of the interacting multiple model algorithm","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4505329","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance prediction of the interacting multiple model algorithm","sourcePdf":"220926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041335S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"5771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"105","articleId":"220926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":220931,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the DC-DC transformer region, the voltage transfer ratio of the PPRC was found to be practically constant and independent of the input voltage and load. In this mode, all the switching elements operate in the zero voltage switching (ZVS) condition. Another important feature of the proposed DC-DC transformer is the ability to drive it by an arbitrary switching frequency, provided that the latter is lower than the self-oscillating frequency. This permits the synchronization of the converter to a master clock. The analytical expressions for voltage and current stresses, as well as the other key parameters derived, are applied to develop design guidelines for the DC-DC transformer. The proposed topology was tested experimentally on a 100-W unit which was run in the 200-kHz frequency region.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Zero voltage switching","DC-DC power converters","Switching frequency","Frequency synchronization","Clocks","Stress","Guidelines","Topology","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC transformers","high-frequency transformers","power convertors","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant DC-DC transformer","push-pull parallel resonant converter","voltage transfer ratio","switching elements","zero voltage switching","self-oscillating frequency","synchronization","master clock","100 W","200 kHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/7.220940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/5771/00220940.pdf","startPage":"926","endPage":"934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.220940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A resonant DC-DC transformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A resonant DC-DC transformer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220940/","volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4500560","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A resonant DC-DC transformer","sourcePdf":"220940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029321S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"5771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"20","articleId":"220940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":220943,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

Experimental results are given for a 50-W converter. The converter can operate for load resistances ranging from full load to infinity. The DC output voltage is regulated against load and line variations by varying the switching frequency. The relative frequency range was about 70% as the load resistance was varied from a full load of 50 Omega to infinity. The measured parameters agreed well with theoretical predictions.

Unfortunately, in most systems the target position measurements are provided in terms of range and azimuth (bearing) with respect to the sensor location. This situation requires either converting the measurements to a Cartesian frame of reference and working directly on converted measurements or using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in mixed coordinates. An accurate means of tracking with debiased consistent converted measurements which accounts for the sensor inaccuracies over all practical geometries and accuracies is presented. This method is compared with the mixed coordinates EKF approach as well as a previous converted measurement approach which is an acceptable approximation only for moderate cross-range errors. The new approach is shown to be more accurate in terms of position and velocity errors and provides consistent estimates (i.e., compatible with the filter calculated covariances) for all practical situations. The combination of parameters (range, range accuracy, and azimuth accuracy) for which debiasing is needed is presented in explicit form.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/5771/00220948.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.220948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.220948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking with debiased consistent converted measurements versus EKF","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coordinate measuring machines","Target tracking","Nonlinear filters","Radar tracking","Motion measurement","Position measurement","Geometry","Azimuth","Radar measurements","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","measurement errors","parameter estimation","position measurement","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sonar","radar","error statistics","debiased consistent converted measurements","Cartesian coordinates","target position measurements","range","azimuth","extended Kalman filter","mixed coordinates","cross-range errors","velocity errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Tracking with debiased consistent converted measurements versus EKF","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4500568","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking with debiased consistent converted measurements versus EKF","sourcePdf":"220948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036482S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"5771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"303","articleId":"220948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":220950,"authors":[{"name":"E.K.

In particular, they apply the method to the design of narrowband minimum-power antenna array processors which are robust in the presence of errors such as array element placement, look direction misalignment, and frequency offset. They first show that the constrained minimum power problem has a unique global minimum provided that the constraint set is nonempty. Then it is shown how the design problem derived directly from considerations of the sensitivity of the antenna array processor to errors can be transformed into a quadratic programming problem with linear inequality constraints which can be solved efficiently by the standard active set strategy. They also present numerical results for two types of nonsmooth constraints developed to provided robustness. These results confirm the effectiveness of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.220972","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5772/00220972.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.220972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"403","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to the optimization of robust antenna array processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to the optimization of robust antenna array processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220972/","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4472419","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to the optimization of robust antenna array processors","sourcePdf":"00220972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041983S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","articleId":"220972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":220973,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In the first approach, a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account scattering terms up to second order is used. Closed-form expressions for the second-order scattering terms are derived for cylinders that are in each other's near field. The second approach is based on the radiative transfer equations, which are solved by an iterative method up to and including the second-order terms. Radar backscatter measurements at X-band for a collection of metallic cylinders over a conducting ground plane are compared with the Monte Carlo and radiative transfer solutions. The data were acquired polarimetrically from 144 independent spots of the cylinder layer at incidence angles ranging from 20 degrees to 60 degrees . The simulation results agree well with the measured data and are used to check the validity of the radiative transfer results for a medium with large particles. It is shown that both the phase function computed for the cylinders and the extinction matrix of the layer are overestimated in the radiative transfer solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo simulation of scattering from a layer of vertical cylinders","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.220978","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5772/00220978.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.220978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=220978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo simulation of scattering from a layer of vertical cylinders","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4472426","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo simulation of scattering from a layer of vertical cylinders","sourcePdf":"00220978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070286S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","articleId":"220978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":220983,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The inversion values are compared with the target values, and the iterative constrained method is shown to give smaller errors, but it requires longer computer CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.220983","startPage":"498","endPage":"502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5772/00220983.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.220983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface roughness determination using spectral correlations of scattered intensities and an artificial neural network technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Artificial neural networks","Surface waves","Speckle","Scattering parameters","Iterative methods","Integral equations","Inverse problems","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","feedforward neural nets","inverse problems","Monte Carlo methods","surface topography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam wave illumination","surface roughness","electromagnetic scattering","multilayer perceptrons","spectral correlations","artificial neural network","RMS height","correlation distance","one-dimensional rough surfaces","intensity correlations","Monte Carlo simulations","explicit inversion method","iterative constrained inversion method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/220983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Surface roughness determination using spectral correlations of scattered intensities and an artificial neural network technique","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4472430","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface roughness determination using spectral correlations of scattered intensities and an artificial neural network technique","sourcePdf":"00220983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031771S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","articleId":"220983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":221033,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The noise measured is between 2400 e/sup -/ and 3000 e/sup -/. An important characteristic of ICON is that it can tolerate a detector leakage current of 10 mu A at the DC-coupled input.

During the course of their execution, the tasks communicate with each other to collectively accomplish a common goal. Such intertask communications lead to precedence constraints between the modules of different tasks. The objective of this scheduling is to minimize the maximum normalized task response time, called the system hazard. Real-time tasks and the precedence constraints among them are expressed in a PERT/CPM form with activity on arc (AOA), called the task graph (TG), in which the dominance relationship between simultaneously schedulable modules is derived and used to reduce the size of the set of active schedules to be searched for an optimal schedule. Lower-bound costs are estimated, and are used to bound the search. An example of the task scheduling problem and some computational experiences are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.221134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/5778/00221134.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.221134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal scheduling of cooperative tasks in a distributed system using an enumerative method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221134/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal scheduling of cooperative tasks in a distributed system using an enumerative method","volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4469503","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal scheduling of cooperative tasks in a distributed system using an enumerative method","sourcePdf":"00221134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052484S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"26","articleId":"221134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":221135,"authors":[{"name":"E.R.

The photonic network is based on a passive star-coupled configuration in which high topological connectivity is achieved with low complexity and excellent fault tolerance. The channels are preallocated to the nodes with the proposed approach, and each node has a home channel it uses either for data packet transmission or data packet reception. The performance of a generalized random access protocol is compared to an approach based on interleaved time multiplexing. Semi-Markov analytic models are developed to investigate the performance of the two protocols. The analytic models are validated through extensive simulation. The performance is evaluated in terms of network throughput and packet delay with variations in the number of nodes, data channels, and packet generation rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access protocols","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Media Access Protocol","Tunable circuits and devices","WDM networks","Optical network units","Fault tolerance","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","multi-access systems","optical links","protocols","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC protocols","media access control protocols","wavelength division multiplexing","WDMA networks","preallocated channels","semi-Markov models","photonic networks","optically interconnected star-coupled system","multiple-access channels","passive star-coupled configuration","topological connectivity","low complexity","fault tolerance","data packet transmission","data packet reception","generalized random access protocol","interleaved time multiplexing","analytic models","network throughput","packet delay"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.221206","startPage":"590","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/5782/00221206.pdf","doi":"10.1109/49.221206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity multiple access protocols for wavelength-division multiplexed photonic networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity multiple access protocols for wavelength-division multiplexed photonic networks","accessionNumber":"4484175","publicationDate":"May 1993","volume":"11","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity multiple access protocols for wavelength-division multiplexed photonic networks","sourcePdf":"00221206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054316S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"84","articleId":"221206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":221208,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first determines the order of the seasonal multiplicative AR process, and the second uses the least squares or the IRWLS to estimate the optimal nonseasonal AR model parameters. In the third step one obtains the intermediate series by back forecast, which is followed by using the least squares or the IRWLS to estimate the optimal seasonal AR parameters.

For a unit with prohibited zone(s), the zone(s) divide the operating region between the minimum generation limit (Pmin) and the maximum generation limit (Pmax) into disjoint convex subregions. These disjoint subregions form a nonconvex decisions space and the associated economic dispatch problem is thus a nonconvex optimization problem. As a result, the conventional Lagrangian relaxation (LR) approach (e.g. the lambda - delta iterative approach) cannot be applied directly. The method proposed decomposes the nonconvex decision space into a small number of subsets such that each of the associated dispatch problems is either infeasible or one that can be directly solved via the conventional LR approach. Based on the decomposition, the optimal solution is the least costly one among all the feasible solutions of the associated dispatch problems. Examples are also given to illustrate the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.221233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/5783/00221233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.221233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5783","startPage":"246","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reserve constrained economic dispatch with prohibited operating zones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reserve constrained economic dispatch with prohibited operating zones","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4439905","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reserve constrained economic dispatch with prohibited operating zones","sourcePdf":"00221233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024994S","chronDate":"Feb.  1993","isNumber":"5783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"197","articleId":"221233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":221241,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The bottlenecks in both algorithm and implementation are described in some detail. Various techniques and in particular their potential bottlenecks when using large-scale parallel processing are also discussed. A new parallel algorithm, the Maclaurin-Newton method (MNM), is used for stability analysis for the first time. The implementation of this method for the dynamic analysis is discussed, and it is compared to other methods. The advantage of the MNM is that it is completely parallel while retaining some Newton-type convergence characteristics. The relaxed-Newton-type algorithms are shown to be the most effective. A toroidal method (or traveling window technique) is adopted for parallel-in-space and -in-time implementation.

The selection identifies the most severe outage in each local area such that power flows need only be run for these worst-case outages. Both single and double branch outages are considered. Double outages are defined as scenarios where two branches share one bus, thereby providing coverage for events where a single branch outage evolves into a double branch outage due to protection, relay, or breaker failure. This system has been tested using the IEEE 30-bus system and a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 182-bus system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221245/","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4448750","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Voltage security assessment using generalized operational planning knowledge","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage security assessment using generalized operational planning knowledge","sourcePdf":"00221245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047098S","chronDate":"Feb.  1993","isNumber":"5783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"17","articleId":"221245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":221263,"authors":[{"name":"B.F.

A controller structure with one free damping parameter k/sub D/ is derived with the following properties: damping and natural frequency of the yaw mode are independent of speed; k/sub D/ can be adjusted to the desired damping level; and a variation of k/sub D/ has no influence on the natural frequency of the yaw mode and no influence on the steering transfer function by which the driver keeps the car-considered as a mass point at the front axle-on a planned path. Simulations with a nonlinear car steering model show significant safety advantages of the new control concept in situations when the driver of the conventional car has to stabilize unexpected yaw motions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Damping","Wheels","Frequency","Robust control","Linear feedback control systems","Weight control","Transfer functions","Vehicle safety","Motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","feedback","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust yaw damping","cars","linear model","active car steering","robust decoupling control law","feedback"]}],"doi":"10.1109/87.221348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/5788/00221348.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.221348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust yaw damping of cars with front and rear wheel steering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust yaw damping of cars with front and rear wheel steering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221348/","volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4421524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust yaw damping of cars with front and rear wheel steering","sourcePdf":"00221348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027026S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"101","articleId":"221348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":221350,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

This controller is designed so the dynamic behaviors of the master robot and the slave robot are functions of each other. These functions, which the designer chooses based upon the application, are described, and a control architecture is proposed to achieve these functions. To guarantee that the specified functions and proposed architecture govern the system behavior, H/sub infinity / control theory and model reduction techniques are used. Several experiments were conducted to verify the theoretical derivations. This control method is unique, because it does not require any transfer of either position or velocity information between the master robot and the slave robot; it only requires the transfer of forces. Although this property leads to a wider communication bandwidth between the master and slave robots, the entire system may still suffer from a positional error buildup between the master robot and slave robot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/87.221351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.221351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5788","startPage":"50","endPage":"62","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/5788/00221351.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00221351.png","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221351","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Telerobotics","Robots","Master-slave","Control theory","Reduced order systems","Force control","Velocity control","Communication system control","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","force measurement","robots","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","forces transfer","force measurement telecontrol","controller design framework","telerobotic systems","dynamic behaviors","master robot","slave robot","H/sub infinity / control theory","model reduction techniques","positional error buildup"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A controller design framework for telerobotic systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4421527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221351/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A controller design framework for telerobotic systems","sourcePdf":"00221351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043708S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"122","articleId":"221351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":221363,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

Though vector quantizers are more efficient than scalar quantizers, their use for accurate quantization of linear predictive coding (LPC) information (using 24-26 bits/frame) is impeded by their prohibitively high complexity. A split vector quantization approach is used here to overcome the complexity problem. An LPC vector consisting of 10 line spectral frequencies (LSFs) is divided into two parts, and each part is quantized separately using vector quantization. Using the localized spectral sensitivity property of the LSF parameters, a weighted LSF distance measure is proposed. With this distance measure, it is shown that the split vector quantizer can quantize LPC information in 24 bits/frame with an average spectral distortion of 1 dB and less than 2% of the frames having spectral distortion greater than 2 dB. The effect of channel errors on the performance of this quantizer is also investigated and results are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/5789/00221363.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.221363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.221363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient vector quantization of LPC parameters at 24 bits/frame","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Linear predictive coding","Bit rate","Speech coding","Distortion measurement","Speech processing","Speech analysis","Impedance","Frequency conversion","Weight measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear predictive coding","speech coding","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech coding","LPC parameters","linear predictive coding","split vector quantization","LPC vector","line spectral frequencies","localized spectral sensitivity","LSF parameters","LSF distance measure","average spectral distortion","channel","performance","24 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Efficient vector quantization of LPC parameters at 24 bits/frame","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4394475","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient vector quantization of LPC parameters at 24 bits/frame","sourcePdf":"00221363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051273S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"407","articleId":"221363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":221364,"authors":[{"name":"F.K.

It is argued that maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters via the forward-backward algorithm may not lead to values which maximize recognition accuracy. An alternative estimation procedure called corrective training, which is aimed at minimizing the number of recognition errors, is described. Corrective training is similar to a well-known error-correcting training procedure for linear classifiers and works by iteratively adjusting the parameter values so as to make correct words more probable and incorrect words less probable. There are strong parallels between corrective training and maximum mutual information estimation; the relationship of these two techniques is discussed and a comparison is made of their performance. Although it has not been proved that the corrective training algorithm converges, experimental evidence suggests that it does, and that it leads to fewer recognition errors that can be obtained with conventional training methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4394482","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimating hidden Markov model parameters so as to maximize speech recognition accuracy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating hidden Markov model parameters so as to maximize speech recognition accuracy","sourcePdf":"00221369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037774S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"30","articleId":"221369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":221371,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The recognition of these 408 syllables becomes even more difficult when only very limited training data are available. A special direct-concatenation approach for training hidden Markov models (HMMs) to recognize these syllables with very limited training data is developed in which each syllable is divided into INITIAL and FINAL parts and 408 right-context-dependent INITIAL HMMs and 38 left-context-independent FINAL HMMs are separately trained and the transition region carefully taken account of, and then these INITIAL and FINAL HMMs are directly concatenated to form syllable recognition. Experimental results show that this approach can utilize the very limited training data most efficiently and provide significant improvements in recognition performance. Although the results are obtained for Mandarin syllables, the approach is believed to be equally helpful for the recognition of other confusing vocabularies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/5789/00221375.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.221375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.221375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct-concatenation approach to train hidden Markov models to recognize the highly confusing Mandarin syllables with very limited training data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Vocabulary","Speech synthesis","Training data","Speech recognition","Signal synthesis","Signal to noise ratio","Testing","Acoustic distortion","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mandarin syllables recognition, HMM","training data","direct-concatenation approach","hidden Markov models","confusing vocabularies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"A direct-concatenation approach to train hidden Markov models to recognize the highly confusing Mandarin syllables with very limited training data","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4394487","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct-concatenation approach to train hidden Markov models to recognize the highly confusing Mandarin syllables with very limited training data","sourcePdf":"00221375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044335S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"4","articleId":"221375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":221450,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The power gain is a maximum at 6.6 dB and the axial ratio is a minimum of 0.3 dB at this off-normal angle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399458","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the theory of eccentric spiral antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of eccentric spiral antennas","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095511S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"6","articleId":"221453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":221465,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The differential equation approach using finite difference or finite element methods results in sparse matrices, which is an advantage, but has to cover large volumes, which is a disadvantage. The integral equation approach using the method of moments (MOM) limits the mesh to the surface of the object, which is an advantage, but results in full matrices, which is a disadvantage. It is noted that the ideal case would be to reduce the finite difference type equations close to the object surface and still preserve the sparsity of the matrices. The measured equation of invariance is a new concept in field computation capable of approaching this ideal situation. The mathematics and reasonings to reach a novel computational method based on this concept are presented. It is shown that the method is robust for both convex and concave objects, is much faster than the MOM, and uses a fraction of the memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1992.221465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/668/5790/00221465.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1992.221465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5790","startPage":"2047","endPage":"2050 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The measured equation of invariance-a new concept in field computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The measured equation of invariance-a new concept in field computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221465/","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399446","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The measured equation of invariance-a new concept in field computation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024903S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"33","articleId":"221465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":221480,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

The recursive convolution utilizes the exponential behavior of the first-order time-domain susceptibilities. Alternatively a differential approach, valid for both first- and second-order dispersion relations, has been demonstrated. In the present work, the extension of the recursive convolution approach to second-order dispersion relations is discussed. The extension is very straightforward, with the only added computational burden being a complex recursive accumulation variable. The method has been applied to second-order dispersion relations for magnetized plasmas and ferrites with good accuracy, and appears simpler and more efficient than the differential methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1992.221483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/668/5790/00221483.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1992.221483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5790","startPage":"1972","endPage":"1975 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite difference time domain recursive convolution for second order dispersive materials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite difference time domain recursive convolution for second order dispersive materials","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221483/","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite difference time domain recursive convolution for second order dispersive materials","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050445S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"1","articleId":"221483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":221485,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A general implementation for arbitrary thin slots is described. The 3-D FDTD code TSAR was selected for the implementation. The implementation of the HTSA into TSAR is based on a slot data file that includes the cell indices where the desired slots are to exist within the FDTD mesh. For an HTSA-defined slot, the wall region local to the slot is shorted, and, therefore, to change the slot's topology simply requires altering the file to include the desired cells.

In the present work, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is applied to this geometry. The radiation pattern and the input impedance are calculated. The FDTD radiation patterns are compared with both moment method and experimental results, and FDTD impedance calculations are compared with measurements. The results calculated with the FDTD method agree with those of the moment method and the experiments.

The first approach by J.G. Maloney and G.S. Smith (see IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol.AP-40, no.3, 1992) uses a special FDTD cell to handle the sheet. Throughout the cell the component of the electric field tangential to the sheet is assumed to be constant. However, the component of the electric field normal to the sheet assumes different constant values in the sheet and in the space adjacent to the sheet. The discontinuity of the normal component of the electric field at the surface of the sheet allows for the presence of surface charge. In the second approach by P.A. Tirkas and K.R. Demarest (see IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol.AP-39, no.9, p.1338, 1991) the component of the electric field tangential to the sheet is also assumed to be constant, but the component of the electric displacement normal to the sheet is assumed to vary linearly across the cell. This makes the normal component of the electric field jump by the ratio of the dielectric constants at the surface of the sheet. There are some subtle differences in the two approaches; these may make one prefer one of the approaches over the other for a particular application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1992.221538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/668/5790/00221538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1992.221538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5790","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1669 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discussion of efficient methods for including thin material sheets in the FDTD technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A discussion of efficient methods for including thin material sheets in the FDTD technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221538/","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4395239","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discussion of efficient methods for including thin material sheets in the FDTD technique","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029414S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"2","articleId":"221538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":221546,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Lee Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Wai-Lee Ko","id":"37357499700"},{"name":"R.

In this way, the level of cochannel interference is reduced, increasing the spectrum efficiency and, ultimately, the capacity of the network. The realization of such an adaptive base-station antenna requires an architecture capable of locating and tracking the mobiles, and thus a beamforming network capable of producing the multiple independent beams. These two tasks are illustrated as a source estimation or direction finding processor and a beamformer. A preliminary study was carried out to establish a figure of merit for the proposed antenna system in terms of the increase in spectrum efficiency that could be achieved relative to conventional antenna systems. The program of research described has demonstrated the feasibility of a multiple beam base-station antenna system for future high-capacity cellular networks, although there is much to be accomplished before it could be incorporated into an existing network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1992.221586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/668/5790/00221586.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1072 vol.2","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00221586.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1992.221586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spectrum efficient cellular base-station antenna architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221586/","displayDocTitle":"A spectrum efficient cellular base-station antenna architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4395191","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spectrum efficient cellular base-station antenna architecture","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064409S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"6","articleId":"221586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":221632,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

Two design approaches for a single-layered FSS using artificial neural networks were reported. The first uses a bitmap model to represent the unit-cell geometry and the second uses a parametric representation. While the former allows more freedom in choosing the unit-cell geometry, it also requires a much larger training database and more iterations for a convergent design than the latter, which only works for a fixed geometry. Both approaches require the training and inversion of a multilayer perceptron. When extending the artificial neural network approach to the design of multilayered FSS, the parametric representation can reduce the number of variables significantly and thus reduce the size of the neural network and the number of iterations required in the network inversion. Designs of multilayered FSS using dipole and tripole patches and slots were considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1992.221632","startPage":"1400 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1992.221632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/668/5790/00221632.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayered frequency selective surface design using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221632/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayered frequency selective surface design using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4391045","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayered frequency selective surface design using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050924S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"2","articleId":"221632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":221633,"authors":[{"name":"Tsang Leung","affiliation":["Electromagnetics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Tsang Leung","id":"37087934471"},{"name":"Hwang Jeng-Neng","affiliation":["Electromagnetics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Hwang Jeng-Neng","id":"37087511279"},{"name":"D.T.

It is important to investigate the statistical characteristics of fade and nonfade durations as well as those of the fade depth for the design of practical communications systems. Probability density distributions of fade and nonfade durations and a new simulation model are described, based on data measured in Japan. It is shown that the statistical characteristics of fade and nonfade durations of the measured propagation data can be approximated very well with the sums of two log-normal functions. Man-made structures and artificial environments affect the fade and nonfade statistics, especially in freeways and urban areas. It is concluded that the proposed model can more adequately describe the fade and nonfade statistics than models proposed previously.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fade/non-fade duration characteristics and a model for land mobile satellite communications channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1992.221643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1992 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/668/5790/00221643.pdf","startPage":"1364","endPage":"1367 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1992.221643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=221643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","displayDocTitle":"Fade/non-fade duration characteristics and a model for land mobile satellite communications channels","conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4391034","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fade/non-fade duration characteristics and a model for land mobile satellite communications channels","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036187S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","citationCount":"4","articleId":"221643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":221667,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

It is more advisable to recover the uniform samples from the irregularly spaced ones than to resort to a direct interpolation formula. Accordingly, once the uniform samples have been determined, the function values can be efficiently recovered by means of the optimal sampling expansions of central type, which minimize the truncation error for a given number of retained samples. Therefore, the main problem is the development of an efficient and stable algorithm to reconstruct the uniform sample values from the irregularly spaced ones. An algorithm is developed for the 1D case; it can be extended to any 2D case for which a uniform sampling representation is available. To test the algorithm performance, a set of numerical experiments has been carried out relevant to the reconstruction of the electric field radiated by a nonfocusing planar circular array symmetric with respect to the x axis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/221745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 June 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-25 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4386957","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation of electromagnetic fields from nonuniform samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation of electromagnetic fields from nonuniform samples","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00221745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029305S","chronDate":"18-25 June 1992","isNumber":"5790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"668","articleId":"221745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":221756,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

Therefore, one computes the optimal adaptive weight vector for one of these subarrays and copies it to the others.

This new concept exploits the induced special data structure which can be described as a generalized rank one eigenvalue problem and can be solved by means of a linear (overdetermined) system solver. Since the desired signal is reconstructed using just a single snapshot, no difficulties with nonstationary and coherent interferers arise. Furthermore, there does not exist any transient behavior of the algorithm.

This concept is shown to lead to a very simple and modular architecture. The implemented converter also allows selection of the converter order and the decimation factor in order to find the best tradeoff between resolution, conversion time or bandwidth, and power consumption. As the converter architecture is completely modular, it can rapidly be tailored for a specific application with minimized silicon area.

Saturation of the input transistors restricts the sensing of differential voltages to a common-mode (CM) range roughly between the positive and the negative supply rails. Input stage configurations that not only provide solutions to prevent the signal reversal and the excessive increase of input bias current, but also provide an extension of the CM range far beyond the supply rails, while the transconductance for differential input voltages remains constant, are described. Integrated implementations of the input stages realized a CM range reaching +15 V at a single supply voltage as low as 1 V, while the input bias current was limited to 6 mu A.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.222172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5792/00222172.pdf","startPage":"750","endPage":"757","doi":"10.1109/4.222172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extension of the common-mode range of bipolar input stages beyond the supply rails of operational amplifiers and comparators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Extension of the common-mode range of bipolar input stages beyond the supply rails of operational amplifiers and comparators","volume":"28","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4480143","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension of the common-mode range of bipolar input stages beyond the supply rails of operational amplifiers and comparators","sourcePdf":"00222172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054057S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"7","articleId":"222172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":222173,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The multiple-loop configuration used results in a lower harmonic distortion, at least in the audio band, compared to conventional three-stage amplifiers with nested Miller compensation. Design criteria and stability conditions for good stability of amplifiers using a multiple- (greater than two) loop topology are presented. The amplifier operates with a single power supply which has a minimum value of 3 V. With a 5-V supply, power dissipation is 10 mW and total harmonic distortion (THD) is -83 dB for a -V/sub p-p/ differential output signal at 10 kHz and a load of 50 Omega . With an 8 Omega load and for a 10-kHz, 4-V/sub p-p/ output signal, THD is -68 dB.

Yet, except for simple environments and applications, analog hardware will not suffice to process and compact the raw image flow from the photosensitive array. To solve this output problem, an on-chip array of bare Boolean processors with halftoning facilities is proposed, with versatility provided by programmability. For a pixel memory size of 3 b, the authors demonstrate both the technological practicality and the computational efficiency of this programmable Boolean retina concept. Using semistatic shifting structures together with some interaction circuitry, a minimal retina Boolean processor can be built with less than 30 transistors and controlled by as few as six global clock signals. The successful design, integration, and test of a 65*76 Boolean retina on a 50-mm/sup 2/ CMOS 2- mu m circuit are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.222178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5792/00222178.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.222178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A programmable artificial retina","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=222178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222178/","displayDocTitle":"A programmable artificial retina","volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4480149","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable artificial retina","sourcePdf":"00222178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043449S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"79","articleId":"222178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":222179,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The authors have attempted to exploit the principal advantages of analog VLSI, namely, its small area, high speed, and low power, while minimizing the effects of its limited accuracy, inflexibility, and lack of storage capacity. A CCD/CMOS stereo system implementation, capable of processing several thousand image frame pairs per second for 40*40-pixel binocular images, is proposed. A 40*40-pixel absolute-value-of-difference (AVD) array, a core processor of the stereo system, was fabricated in a 2- mu m CCD/CMOS process. Individual unit cells in the array were characterized and tested. The array functionality was tested by imbedding it in a computerized stereo system and using both real-scene and computer-generated input image pairs. The system output is compared with full computer simulations for the same image pairs, showing good correlation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5792/00222179.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.222179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.222179","startPage":"799","endPage":"807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40*40 CCD/CMOS absolute-value-of-difference processor for use in a stereo vision system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222179/","displayDocTitle":"A 40*40 CCD/CMOS absolute-value-of-difference processor for use in a stereo vision system","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4475549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40*40 CCD/CMOS absolute-value-of-difference processor for use in a stereo vision system","sourcePdf":"00222179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184254S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","articleId":"222179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":222181,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The layout area of the sense amplifier is reduced to 70% of that of a conventional CMOS common I/O sense amplifier due to the removal of PMOS transistors from the array. The readout time is improved to 35% of that of a conventional CMOS sense amplifier because of direct sensing and a 1/10 reduction in V/sub T/ mismatch.

The amplifier is found to have a gain-bandwidth product of 3 MHz, an offset current of 0.8 mu A (signal range +or-700 mu A), and a (theoretically) unlimited slew rate. The amplifier is realized in a standard CMOS 2.4- mu m process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.222187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5792","startPage":"849","endPage":"852","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5792/00222187.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS current-mode operational amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A CMOS current-mode operational amplifier","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4475557","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS current-mode operational amplifier","sourcePdf":"00222187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020415S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"86","articleId":"222187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":222190,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.D. van den Broeke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"L.A.D.","lastName":"van den Broeke","id":"37388838400"},{"name":"A.J.

The FDTD electric field across the nonlinear load (which determines the voltage across the load) is calculated by solving a nonlinear equation at each time step. This allows the time step to be at the Courant limit, and is more efficient than reducing the time step size in all the FDTD cells to maintain stability in just the cell containing the nonlinear load. The stability of this approach relative to a simpler approach of approximating the diode as a variable resistor is demonstrated. As a validation of the method the transient current in a long dipole antenna with a nonlinear load excited by a pulsed plane wave is computed and compared with calculated results obtained by another method.

The unknown field or response is expressed as a twofold summation of shifted and dilated forms of a properly chosen basis function, which is often referred to as the mother wavelet. The wavelet expansion can adaptively fit itself to the various length scales associated with the scatterer by distributing the localized functions near the discontinuities and the more spatially diffused ones over the smooth expanses of the scatterer. The approach is thus best suited for the analysis of scatterers which contain a broad spectrum of length scales ranging from a subwavelength to several wavelengths. Using a Galerkin method and subsequently applying a threshold procedure, the moment-method matrix is rendered sparsely populated. The structure of the matrix reveals the localized scale-fitting distribution long before the matrix equation is solved. The performance of the proposed discretization scheme is illustrated by a numerical study of electromagnetic coupling through a double-slot aperture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.222280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5794/00222280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.222280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5794","startPage":"610","endPage":"619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of wavelet expansions in the method of moments (EM scattering)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=222280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the use of wavelet expansions in the method of moments (EM scattering)","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4484656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of wavelet expansions in the method of moments (EM scattering)","sourcePdf":"00222280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039642S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"254","articleId":"222280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":222286,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Specifically, the variation of the resistance used along the monopole is one proposed by Wu and King (1965). This antenna is analyzed by the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method utilizing a new, efficient technique for handling the thin-walled, conducting tube that forms the resistance. The electromagnetic field in the space surrounding the antenna is determined as a function of time, and quantities useful for describing the performance of the antenna are then calculated from these results. Graphical displays of the results are used to give new insight into the physical processes for transient radiation form this antenna. An experimental model is constructed using a discretized version of the Wu-King profile formed from a set of precision, high-frequency resistors. Measurements of both the reflected voltage in the feed line and the time-varying radiated field are in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.222286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5794/00222286.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.222286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of transient radiation from the Wu-King resistive monopole-FDTD analysis and experimental measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=222286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222286/","displayDocTitle":"A study of transient radiation from the Wu-King resistive monopole-FDTD analysis and experimental measurements","volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4484662","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of transient radiation from the Wu-King resistive monopole-FDTD analysis and experimental measurements","sourcePdf":"00222286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036064S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"45","articleId":"222286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":222287,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Since, for stability, the inverse of the polynomial differential operator defined by some of the estimated parameters has to be stable, the adaptive law is modified using a projection technique.

When a laser beam sequentially scans the tissue (maximal area approximately 12 cm*12 cm), moving blood cells generate Doppler components in the backscattered light. A fraction of this light is detected by a remote photodiode and converted into an electrical signal. In the signal processor, a signal proportional to the tissue perfusion at each measurement point is calculated and stored. When the scanning procedure is completed, the system generates a color-coded perfusion image on a monitor. A perfusion image is typically built up of data from 4096 measurement sites, recorded during a time period of 4 min. This image has a spatial resolution of about 2 mm. A theory for the system inherent amplification factor dependence on the distance between individual measurement points and detector is proposed and correction measures are presented. Performance results for the laser Doppler perfusion imager obtained with a flow simulator are presented. The advantages of the method are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.222322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.222322","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5796/00222322.pdf","startPage":"309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laser Doppler perfusion imaging by dynamic light scattering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222322/","displayDocTitle":"Laser Doppler perfusion imaging by dynamic light scattering","volume":"40","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4484680","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"8375866","publicationDate":"April 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser Doppler perfusion imaging by dynamic light scattering","sourcePdf":"222322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056573S","chronDate":"April  1993","isNumber":"5796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"306","articleId":"222322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":222326,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Large electrodes were used to provide a more uniform current distribution and reduce the contact impedance. A large electrode differs from a point electrode in that it has shunting and edge effects that cannot be modeled by a single resistor. The finite-element method (FEM) was used to study the electric field distributions underneath an electrode, and three models were developed: a FEM model, a simplified FEM model, and a weighted load model. The FEM models considered both shunting and edge effects and closely matched the experimental measurements. It is concluded that FEM models of electrodes can be used to improve the performance of an electrical impedance tomography reconstruction algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.222326","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"335","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5796/00222326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.222326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element modeling of electrode-skin contact impedance in electrical impedance tomography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Contacts","Tomography","Electrodes","Density measurement","Current measurement","Impedance measurement","Electric variables measurement","Voltage","Current density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","electric impedance imaging","finite element analysis","physiological models","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element modelling","shunting effects","single resistor","medical diagnostic imaging","reconstruction algorithm performance","electrode-skin contact impedance","electrical impedance tomography","current distribution","large electrode","point electrode","edge effects","electric field distributions","weighted load model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Electric Impedance","Electrodes","Humans","Mathematics","Models, Biological","Skin Physiology","Tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1993","displayDocTitle":"Finite element modeling of electrode-skin contact impedance in electrical impedance tomography","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4484684","pubMedId":"8375870","publicationDate":"April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222326/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element modeling of electrode-skin contact impedance in electrical impedance tomography","sourcePdf":"222326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048109S","chronDate":"April  1993","isNumber":"5796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"64","articleId":"222326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":222328,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The analysis leads to the identification of potential failures and their causes and makes it possible to perform efficient preventive maintenance. Work on the design of a vibration monitoring methodology for rolling element bearings (REB) based on neural network technology is presented. This technology provides an attractive complement to traditional vibration analysis because of the potential of neural networks to operate in real-time mode and to handle data that may be distorted or noisy. The significance of this work relies on the fact that REB failures are responsible for a large fraction of the malfunctions in manufacturing equipment.

Neural Networks, vol.1, p.167-78 (1990). Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks (PSHNNs) involve a number of stages with error detection at the end of each stage, i.e., rejection of error-causing vectors, which are then fed into the next stage after a nonlinear transformation. The stages operate in parallel during testing. Statistical properties and the mechanisms of vector rejection of the PSHNN are discussed in comparison to the maximum likelihood method and the backpropagation network. The PSHNN is highly fault tolerant and robust against errors in the weight values due to the adjustment of the error detection bounds to compensate errors in the weight values. These properties are exploited to develop architectures for programmable implementations in which the programmable parts are reduced to on-off or bipolar switching operations for bulk computations and attenuators for pointwise operations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.222643","startPage":"218","endPage":"227","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/5803/00222643.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.222643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks.

The two resulting issues, the sensory system and the computer processing required to detect faults in the sheet material accurately, were examined. It was found that scattered coherent light from the surface of the material being processed could be directly conditioned by a photodetector so as to produce a small set of features which are then examined by a neural network trained to find unsatisfactory surface conditions. A surface inspection system using measurement of the angular distribution over a 25 degrees C cone angle of the scattering was constructed, calibrated, and evaluated for inspection of coated sheet and steel samples. Features, created by a simulated segmented photodetector, were inputs to a neural network which used classification based upon T. Kohonen's (1989) learning vector quantization (LVQ2). The system was evaluated with CrO/sub 2/ coated steel samples. Classification by fault or no-fault categorized 133 samples corrected out of 135, while there were seven errors in one attempt at classification by the various common types of surface fault out of the same number of test samples and nine in another.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.222644","startPage":"228","endPage":"234","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/5803/00222644.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.222644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web process inspection using neural classification of scattering light","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Light scattering","Sheet materials","Photodetectors","Neural networks","Steel","Fault detection","Vector quantization","Error correction","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic optical inspection","light scattering","neural nets","optical variables measurement","photodetectors","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["web process inspection","angular distribution measurement","neural classification","sensory system","computer processing","sheet material","scattered coherent light","photodetector","surface inspection system","learning vector quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Web process inspection using neural classification of scattering light","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4484012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web process inspection using neural classification of scattering light","sourcePdf":"00222644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027833S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"9","articleId":"222644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":222645,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

Problems associated with the more common open-loop training scheme, and how these are addressed by the proposed closed-loop method, are discussed. An inverse nonlinear control using a neural network (INC/NN), a control strategy which incorporates the neural network for control of nonlinear systems, is described and used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the closed-loop training scheme.

In the method, two disturbance observers are applied to each joint. One is used to realize a robust motion controller. The other is used to obtain a sensorless torque controller. A robust acceleration controller based on the disturbance observer is shown. To obtain the sensorless torque control, it is necessary to calculate the reaction torque when the mechanical system performs a force task. The calculation method for the reaction torque is explained. Then the method is expanded to workspace force control in the multi-degree-of-freedom manipulator.

Planar images of beta -emitting radionuclides are used to evaluate the filter because they exhibit higher degradation than images of single photon emitters due to increased photon scattering and collimator septal penetration. The filter performance is quantitatively evaluated and compared to that of the Wiener filter by investigating the relationship between the externally measured counts from sources of phosphorous-32 (/sup 32/P) at various depths in water. An effective linear attenuation coefficient for /sup 32/P is determined to be equal to 0.13 cm/sup -1/ and 0.14 cm/sup -1/ for the OSNNH and the Wiener filters, respectively. Evaluation of phantom and patient filtered images demonstrates that the OSNNH filter avoids ring effects caused by the ill-conditioned blur matrix and noise overriding caused by matrix inversion, typical of other restoration filters such as the Wiener.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.222667","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/5804/00222667.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.222667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order statistic-neural network hybrid filters for gamma camera-bremsstrahlung image restoration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","displayDocTitle":"Order statistic-neural network hybrid filters for gamma camera-bremsstrahlung image restoration","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4479511","pubMedId":"18218392","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order statistic-neural network hybrid filters for gamma camera-bremsstrahlung image restoration","sourcePdf":"00222667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041701S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"16","articleId":"222667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":222669,"authors":[{"name":"H.

By using preconditioning methods, the convergence properties of most iterative methods can be greatly enhanced without changing their ultimate solution. To increase reconstruction speed, spatially invariant preconditioning filters that can be designed using the tomographic system response and implemented using 2-D frequency-domain filtering techniques have been applied. In a sample application, reconstructions from noiseless, simulated projection data, were performed using preconditioned and conventional steepest-descent algorithms. The preconditioned methods demonstrated residuals that were up to a factor of 30 lower than the assisted algorithms at the same iteration. Applications of these methods to regularized reconstructions from projection data containing Poisson noise showed similar, although not as dramatic, behavior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222670/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","volume":"12","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4479514","pubMedId":"18218395","publicationDate":"March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Preconditioning methods for improved convergence rates in iterative reconstructions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preconditioning methods for improved convergence rates in iterative reconstructions","sourcePdf":"00222670.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048061S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"81","articleId":"222670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":222673,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The method was implemented and tested on a Monte Carlo simulator with special care to the noise modeling. Two models were developed, one considering only the geometric aspects of the camera and used for comparison, and one describing a more realistic camera environment. In a typical camera configuration and 140-keV photons, the DOI alone can account for a 6.4-mm discrepancy in position and 12% in energy between two scintillations. Variation of the DOI can still bring additional distortions when photons do not enter the crystal perpendicularly such as in slant hole, cone beam and other focusing collimators. With a 0.95-cm crystal and a 30 degrees slant angle, the obliquity factor can be responsible for a 5.5-mm variation in the event position. Results indicate that both geometrical and stochastic effects of the DOI are definitely reducing the camera performances and should be included in the image formation process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood positioning in the scintillation camera using depth of interaction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.222673","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/5804/00222673.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.222673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=222673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood positioning in the scintillation camera using depth of interaction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4479517","pubMedId":"18218398","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood positioning in the scintillation camera using depth of interaction","sourcePdf":"00222673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029624S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"34","articleId":"222673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":222703,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

The heap data storage structure and space saving encoded data representations for partially fulfilled unit commitment schedules are utilized to facilitate the branch-and-bound procedure. By successive branching and bounding, the unit commitment schedule with the minimum cost can be obtained.

The system is composed of ten 100 MW modules connected in parallel. Each 100 MW module consists of a tap changing transformer and a 12 pulse, force commutated power converter. This system offers a significant reduction of the system rating by reducing the reactive power demand in the converter with control of the tap changing ratio and the converter firing angle. The operational concept of this system is verified through mathematical analysis and computer simulation. The dynamic system interaction between the SMES coil and the AC network is analyzed using a simulation model with EMTP. The analysis results prove that the concept is feasible.

Various mainly subcortical phenomena are studied and simple effects like directional sensitivity and length tuning are modeled. A more accurate retina model has been developed, taking into account some effects of amacrine cells. It is shown that the standard errors occurring in simple models of retinal illusions can be eliminated by using the more accurate models including delays. Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) effects with and without cortical feedback are modeled as well; their CNN models are simple. Simple texture detection effects and motion illusions are explained by neuromorphic CNN models.

Under certain restrictions, cellular neural networks (CNNs) come very close to some Hamiltonian systems; therefore, they are potentially useful for simulating or realizing such systems. It is shown how to map two one-dimensional nonlinear lattices, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice and the Toda lattice, onto a CNN. It is demonstrated for the Toda lattice what happens if the signals are driven beyond the linear region of the output function. Though the system is no longer Hamiltonian, numerical experiments reveal the existence of solitons for special initial conditions.

The net input signals are currents instead of voltages, which avoids the need for current-to-voltage dedicated interfaces in image processing tasks with photosensor devices. Outputs may be either currents or voltages. Cell design relies on exploiting current mirror properties for the efficient implementation of both linear and nonlinear analog operators. Basic design issues, the influence of nonidealities and advanced circuit design issues, and design for manufacturability considerations associated with statistical analysis are discussed. Experimental results are given for three prototypes designed for 1.6- mu m n-well CMOS technologies. One is discrete-time and can be reconfigured via local logic for noise removal, feature extraction (borders and edges), shadow detection, hole filling, and connected component detection (CCD) on a rectangular grid with unity neighborhood radius. The other two prototypes are continuous-time and fixed template: one for CCD and other for noise removal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.222812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5811/00222812.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.222812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5811","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=222812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-mode techniques for the implementation of continuous- and discrete-time cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222812/","displayDocTitle":"Current-mode techniques for the implementation of continuous- and discrete-time cellular neural networks","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4477115","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-mode techniques for the implementation of continuous- and discrete-time cellular neural networks","sourcePdf":"00222812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036345S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"137","articleId":"222812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":222813,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

This is the first algorithmically programmable analog array computer having real-time and supercomputer power on a single chip. The CNN universal machine is described, emphasizing its programmability as well as global and distributed analog memory and logic, high throughput via electromagnetic waves, and complex cells that may be used also for simulating a broad class of PDEs. Its implementation, the CNN universal chip, is also described, along with its use of a multichip supercomputer. Other types of hardware implementations are also briefly discussed.

Exact parameters are derived for winner-take-all CNNs with an arbitrary number of cells, such that their robustness with respect to the simplified structure is maximum. A proof of functionality is given which encompasses both the nominal and the distributed networks. It is found that accuracy requirements increase with the number of cells, such that the largest winner-take-all CNNs that can be reliably implemented with current methods may consist of only about ten cells.

The objective of discriminative training here is to directly minimize the recognition error rate. To achieve this, a formulation that allows controlled approximation of the exact error rate and renders optimization possible is used. The GPD method is implemented in a dynamic-time-warping (DTW)-based system. A linear discriminant function on the DTW distortion sequence is used to replace the conventional average DTW path distance. A series of speaker-independent recognition experiments using the highly confusible English E-set as the vocabulary showed a recognition rate of 84.4% compared to approximately 60% for traditional template training via clustering. The experimental results verified that the algorithm converges to a solution that achieves minimum error rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative training of dynamic programming based speech recognizers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.222873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/5813/00222873.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.222873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=222873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative training of dynamic programming based speech recognizers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4492751","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative training of dynamic programming based speech recognizers","sourcePdf":"00222873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028895S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"34","articleId":"222873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":222875,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The machine is speaker-dependent, and the input speech is in the form of sequences of isolated syllables. The machine can be decomposed into two subsystems. The first subsystem recognizes the syllables using hidden Markov models. Because every syllable can represent many different homonym characters and form different multisyllabic words with syllables on its right or left, the second subsystem is needed to identify the exact characters from the syllables and correct the errors in syllable recognition. The real-time implementation is on an IBM PC/AT, connected to three sets of specially designed hardware boards on which seven TMS 320C25 chips operate in parallel.

High-priority transport for the more important signal components results in substantially increased objective service quality. Using a Markov chain voice source model with simple PCM speech encoding and a priority queue, simulation results show a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 45 dB with two priorities over an unprioritized system. Performance is sensitive to the fraction of traffic placed in each priority, and the optimal partition depends on network loss conditions. When this partition is optimized dynamically, quality degrades gracefully over a wide range of load values. Results with DCT encoded speech and video samples show similar behavior. Variations are investigated such as further partition of low-priority information into multiple priorities. A simulation with delay added to represent other network nodes shows general insensitivity to delay of network feedback information.

Since the thickness is typically several orders of magnitude less than the maximum node degree, the algorithms presented represent a considerable theoretical improvement. Experimentally, a realistic model of a radio network is given and the performance of the new algorithms is studied. These results show that, for both types of scheduling, the new algorithms (experimentally) perform consistently better than earlier methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.222924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5815","startPage":"166","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/5815/00222924.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling algorithms for multihop radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/222924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scheduling algorithms for multihop radio networks","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4454156","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling algorithms for multihop radio networks","sourcePdf":"00222924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096733S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"333","articleId":"222924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":222971,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is a feature-based bottom-up approach that is characterized by its learning capability and time-scale invariability. To apply HMMs, one set of time-sequential images is transformed into an image feature vector sequence, and the sequence is converted into a symbol sequence by vector quantization. In learning human action categories, the parameters of the HMMs, one per category, are optimized so as to best describe the training sequences from the category. To recognize an observed sequence, the HMM which best matches the sequence is chosen. Experimental results for real time-sequential images of sports scenes show recognition rates higher than 90%. The recognition rate is improved by increasing the number of people used to generate the training data, indicating the possibility of establishing a person-independent action recognizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing human action in time-sequential images using hidden Markov model","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1992.223161","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/418/5817/00223161.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1992.223161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=223161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/223161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing human action in time-sequential images using hidden Markov model","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399862","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing human action in time-sequential images using hidden Markov model","confLoc":"Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00223161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023696S","chronDate":"15-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"418","citationCount":"625","articleId":"223161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":223162,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

A sensor calibration technique based on the conjunction of a mathematical camera model, the N-planes B-spline (NPBS), with an accurate mechanical calibration setup, is proposed. An algorithm for recovering the rigid transformation (rotation and translation) between the two sets of 3D coordinates obtained by the calibrated imaging range sensor is developed. Its input is sets of points lying on the surface of the object. This input is converted into an octree-spline that allows point-to-surface distances to be computed quickly. A robust nonlinear least-squares minimization technique then finds the optimal pose by minimizing the sum of square distances between the two sets of 3D coordinates. The algorithm has been applied to matching human faces with highly accurate results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/418/5817/00223223.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1992.223223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1992.223223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=223223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From accurate range imaging sensor calibration to accurate model-based 3D object localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Calibration","Mechanical sensors","Laser modes","Cameras","Mathematical model","Spline","Robustness","Humans","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","computer vision","face recognition","laser ranging","least squares approximations","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image registration","range imaging sensor calibration","model-based 3D object localization","multiple 3D data sets","laser range finder","mathematical camera model","N-planes B-spline","mechanical calibration setup","rigid transformation","rotation","translation","3D coordinates","octree-spline","point-to-surface distances","robust nonlinear least-squares minimization","sum of square distances","human faces"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/223223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"From accurate range imaging sensor calibration to accurate model-based 3D object localization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4391248","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From accurate range imaging sensor calibration to accurate model-based 3D object localization","confLoc":"Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00223223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048576S","chronDate":"15-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"418","citationCount":"37","articleId":"223223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":223247,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is found that the Fourier power spectra of any two similarly textured patches on a plane are approximately related to each other by an affine transformation. The transformation parameters are a function of the plane's surface normal. This relationship is used as the basis of an algorithm for finding surface normals of textured shapes using the spectrogram, which is one type of local spatial frequency representation. The relationship is validated by testing the algorithm on real textures. By analyzing shape and texture in terms of the local spatial frequency representation, the advantages of the representation for the shape-from-texture problem can be exploited.

The structure takes advantage of two properties of optical signal transmissions on waveguides, namely, unidirectional propagation and predictable propagation delays per unit length. Because of these two properties, time-division multiplexing (TDM) of messages has the same effect as message pipelining on optical waveguides. Two TDM approaches are proposed, and the combination of the two is used in the design of the optical communication structure. Analysis and simulation results are given to demonstrate the communication effectiveness of the system. A clock distribution method is proposed to address potential synchronization problems.

To increase the bandwidth of vector memory operations, several investigators have proposed the use of noninterleaved storage mappings, also known as storage schemes. A method of analyzing the performance of vector references for the class of storage schemes referred to as XOR schemes is described. The proposed measure of relative performance, the variability of an access, is defined and its computation is outlined. The use of variability as a performance indicator is demonstrated and compared with performance measurements made using simulation.

The monolithically integrated optoelectronic receiver is based on pseudomorphic InGaAs on GaAs modulation-doped field-effect transistors (MODFETs) and metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors. High-performance quarter-micrometer MODFETs with f/sub t/'s of approximately 70 GHz are utilized in a two-stage transimpedance amplifier. An asymmetric and a symmetric amplifier design are compared. The symmetric design is found to provide the desired zero DC offset voltage for a variety of supply voltages. Excess MSM-detector dark current and low-frequency internal gain are greatly reduced through the use of a silicon passivation layer and/or AlGaAs cap layer. Receiver transimpedances between 100 and 5000 Omega are obtained by varying the bias on an active feedback resistor. The parasitic capacitances of this common-gate feedback FET are studied. A transimpedance amplifier bandwidth as high as 14 GHz and an overall photoreceiver bandwidth of 11 GHz are measured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MODFET integrated circuits","MODFET circuits","FETs","HEMTs","Voltage","Feedback","Bandwidth","Optical device fabrication","Integrated optoelectronics","Indium gallium arsenide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","integrated optoelectronics","optical interconnections","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSM photodetectors","MODFET-based optoelectronic integrated circuit receiver","optical interconnects","photoreceiver","two-stage transimpedance amplifier","symmetric amplifier","zero DC offset voltage","dark current","low-frequency internal gain","silicon passivation layer","AlGaAs cap layer","transimpedances","active feedback resistor","parasitic capacitances","common-gate feedback FET","0.85 micron","14 GHz","11 GHz","InGaAs-GaAs","GaAs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=223699","doi":"10.1109/16.223699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/5841/00223699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.223699","startPage":"1406","endPage":"1416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5841","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MODFET-based optoelectronic integrated circuit receiver for optical interconnects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A MODFET-based optoelectronic integrated circuit receiver for optical interconnects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/223699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","volume":"40","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4520640","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MODFET-based optoelectronic integrated circuit receiver for optical interconnects","sourcePdf":"00223699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059775S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"37","articleId":"223699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":223723,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Recently, this problem has been settled by using a procedure involving face-centered node points. Such a procedure is efficient, since it preserves the convolution property in the EFIE and, hence, the applicability of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). This procedure is generalized to the three-dimensional and anisotropic case. The generalization is quite straightforward in both the formulation and the programming. A calculation for a scatterer with a relative permittivity as high as 100 indicates that the proposed procedure converges quite rapidly, whereas the conventional using the conjugate gradient method approach fails to converge.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/5842/00223753.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.223753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.223753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=223753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The three-dimensional algorithm of solving the electric field integral equation using face-centered node points, conjugate gradient method, and FFT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integral equations","Permittivity","Gradient methods","Dielectrics","Convolution","Electromagnetic scattering","Fast Fourier transforms","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Finite element methods","User-generated content"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","electric fields","electromagnetic wave scattering","fast Fourier transforms","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D algorithm","three-dimensional algorithm","electric field integral equation","face-centered node points","conjugate gradient method","FFT","scattering","dielectric body","permittivity","convolution property","fast Fourier transform","anisotropic case"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/223753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"The three-dimensional algorithm of solving the electric field integral equation using face-centered node points, conjugate gradient method, and FFT","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4500516","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The three-dimensional algorithm of solving the electric field integral equation using face-centered node points, conjugate gradient method, and FFT","sourcePdf":"00223753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082935S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","articleId":"223753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":223772,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In model calculations, the power spectral density of the prediction error is related to the probability density function of the displacement error. Prediction can be improved both by higher accuracy of motion-compensation and by spatial Wiener filtering in the predictor. Beyond a critical accuracy, the possibility of further improving prediction by more accurate motion-compensation is small. Experiments with videophone signals and with broadcast TV signals confirm these model calculations. Sinc-interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and Wiener filtering are compared at integer-pel, 1/2-pel, 1/4-pel, and 1/8-pel accuracies. A three-state technique for reliable displacement estimation with fractional-pel accuracy is introduced. It is based on phase correlation. For motion-compensation with block size of 16 pels*16 pels, 1/4-pel accuracy appears to be sufficient for broadcast TV signals, whereas for videophone signals, 1/2-pel accuracy is desirable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-compensating prediction with fractional-pel accuracy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.223785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/5843/00223785.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.223785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=223785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/223785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Motion-compensating prediction with fractional-pel accuracy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4500705","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-compensating prediction with fractional-pel accuracy","sourcePdf":"00223785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10302S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"191","articleId":"223785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":223786,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

Among other things, they require synchronization of local clocks, they are subject to export restrictions because of the way they use cryptographic functions, and they are not amenable to use in lower layers of network protocols because of the size and complexity of messages they use. Designing suitable cryptographic protocols that cater to large and dynamic network communities but do not suffer from these problems presents substantial problems. It is shown how a few simple protocols, including one proposed by ISO, can easily be broken, and properties that authentication protocols should exhibit are derived. A methodology for systematically building and testing the security of a family of cryptographic two-way authentication protocols that are as simple as possible yet resistant to a wide class of attacks, efficient, easy to implement and use, and amenable to many different networking environments is described.

The server-aided computation protocol is a two-party protocol between the client and the server. This protocol has two objectives. The first is to allow the client to borrow the computational power from the server to reduce the computation time. Note that the server is powerful, but restricted to polynomial time. The second objective is to keep the client's exponent secret from the server. Efficient and secure protocols which disclose no knowledge about the secret exponent are proposed. The protocols are based on efficient exponentiation algorithms. The computation time depends on the server's power and the speed of the channel between the client and the server. The normalized computation time is introduced and used to evaluate the protocols. It is shown that, for typical parameters, the protocol is the most efficient one ever proposed to provide the highest security level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.223880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5848","startPage":"778","endPage":"784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/5848/00223880.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast server-aided secret computation protocols for modular exponentiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/223880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast server-aided secret computation protocols for modular exponentiation","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4500197","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast server-aided secret computation protocols for modular exponentiation","sourcePdf":"00223880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050303S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","articleId":"223880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":223883,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

The Walsh operational matrix of PWM is introduced as a means of obtaining the Walsh spectral equations of PWM waveforms. The slope and intercept Fourier operational matrices of PWM are also introduced as a means of obtaining Fourier spectral equations of PWM waveforms. A noniterative algorithm that produces piecewise-linear, global solutions between angles and for the angles is proposed. The algorithm also produces the full range of variation of fundamental voltage for given harmonic elimination constraints. The set of systems of linear equations obtained replaces the system of nonlinear transcendental equations used in the Fourier series harmonic elimination approach.

Two-layer versions of these spatial coders are evaluated in a hybrid combination with motion-compensation prediction for interframe data compression. As the SBC scheme with lattice VQ is found to perform the best, this coding scheme is further investigated in combination with more sophisticated interframe-data-compression schemes. The motion-compensated 3-D SBC coder with lattice VQ was found to outperform the techniques used in current standard coders by several dBs in the compression of interlaced CCIR 601 sequences.

Coding and reconstruction mechanisms are jointly designed to achieve a good compromise among compression gain, system complexity, processing delay, error-concealment capability, and reconstruction quality. The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) algorithms for image and video compression are modified to incorporate block interleaving in the spatial domain and DCT coefficient segmentation in the frequency domain to conceal the errors due to packet loss. A new algorithm is developed that recovers the damaged regions by adaptive interpolation in the spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. The weights used for spatial and temporal interpolations are varied according to the motion content and loss patterns of the damaged regions. When combined with proper layered transmission, the proposed coding and reconstruction methods can handle very high packet-loss rates at only a slight cost in compression gain, system complexity, and processing delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/5863/00224235.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.224235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.224235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5863","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding and cell-loss recovery in DCT-based packet video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Discrete cosine transforms","Asynchronous transfer mode","Image reconstruction","Transform coding","Frequency domain analysis","Interpolation","Image coding","Delay systems","Motion pictures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","image reconstruction","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATM networks","image coding","temporal domain","cell-loss recovery","DCT-based packet video","discrete cosine transform","video-coding","asynchronous transfer mode","compression gain","system complexity","processing delay","error-concealment capability","reconstruction quality","Joint Photographic Experts Group","JPEG","Motion Picture Experts Group","MPEG","block interleaving","spatial domain","DCT coefficient segmentation","frequency domain","adaptive interpolation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Coding and cell-loss recovery in DCT-based packet video","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4527967","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding and cell-loss recovery in DCT-based packet video","sourcePdf":"00224235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042854S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"5863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"130","articleId":"224235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":224241,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

First, it is shown that, under some constraints, the impulse response of the system can be expressed as a linear combination of cumulant slices. Then, this result is used to obtain a well-conditioned linear method for estimating the MA parameters of a nonGaussian process. The linear combination of slices used to compute the MA parameters can be constructed from different sets of cumulants of different orders, provided a general framework in which all the statistics can be combined. It is not necessary to use second-order statistics (autocorrelation slice), and therefore the proposed algorithm still provides consistent estimates in the presence of colored Gaussian noise. Another advantage of the method is that while most linear methods give totally erroneous estimates if the order is overestimated, the proposed approach does not require a previous estimation of the filter order. The simulation results confirm the good numerical conditioning of the algorithm and its improvement in performance in comparison to existing methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.224249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5864/00224249.pdf","endPage":"2412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System identification using a linear combination of cumulant slices","doi":"10.1109/78.224249","startPage":"2405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"System identification using a linear combination of cumulant slices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224249/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4486368","publicationDate":"July 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification using a linear combination of cumulant slices","sourcePdf":"00224249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033111S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","articleId":"224249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":224251,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The simulation results show that the transconductance can be varied by a factor of 8 and that, for a power supply of +or-5 V, the linearity error is less than 0.5% for an input voltage of +or-3.0 V.

With this approach the paradox of the constant bandwidth obtained from CFB op-amps is explained. It is demonstrated in a simple manner that the constant gain-bandwidth product of the conventional op-amp and the constant bandwidth of the CFB op-amp are both in accordance with basic feedback theory and that the differences between the traditional op-amp and the CFB op-amp are due to different ways of controlling the closed-loop gain. For the traditional op-amp the closed-loop gain is altered by altering the loop gain, whereas the closed-loop gain in a CFB op-amp configuration is altered by altering the input attenuation to the feedback loop while maintaining a constant-loop gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4486455","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feedback analysis of transimpedance operational amplifier circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback analysis of transimpedance operational amplifier circuits","sourcePdf":"00224302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029601S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"42","articleId":"224302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":224304,"authors":[{"name":"M.

I. Cho and S. U. Lee (1991) proposed a fast algorithm for 2-D N*N DCT, where N=2/sup m/. It requires only half the number of multiplications of the conventional row-column approach. However, the signal flow graph for the postaddition stage seems very complicated and the order of the output index is seemingly irregular, because the postaddition stage was not based on the mathematical expressions. Consequently, derivation of the signal flow graph becomes complicated as the transform size increases. Systematic expressions for the postaddition stage of the algorithm that enable any N*N DCT to be implemented in a straightforward manner are provided here. The results show that the signal flow graph from input to output has a recursive structure in which the structure for smaller N reappears for larger N. However, the number of additions increases in the new signal flow graph at the expense of improving the regularity in the structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.224317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5866/00224317.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.224317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5866","startPage":"259","endPage":"266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the regular structure for the fast 2-D DCT algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the regular structure for the fast 2-D DCT algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4492216","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the regular structure for the fast 2-D DCT algorithm","sourcePdf":"00224317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057251S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"30","articleId":"224317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":224318,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

The cellular neural network (CNN) architecture is chosen for its proven implementability in VLSI and high-speed operation. Since both the CNN and halftoning have a geometrically local character, the CNN provides a natural implementation. The CNN template weights are derived by analogy to the well-known error diffusion algorithm for halftoning. Some limitations of the neural network approach are analyzed, providing an advance in designing template weights over previous methods. These limitations are shown to be especially critical in the case of the small interconnection neighbourhoods needed for efficient implementation. The design criteria are validated by direct simulation. The resulting halftones are shown to be more faithful reproductions of the original than those produced by the error diffusion algorithm. It is suggested that a CNN with optical inputs could provide a high-speed scanner/halftoner for applications such as facsimile.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5866/00224318.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.224318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.224318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image halftoning with cellular neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Digital images","Pixel","Neural networks","Image resolution","Logic arrays","Displays","Printing","Very large scale integration","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image halftoning","cellular neural networks","halftoning application","VLSI","CNN","geometrically local character","error diffusion algorithm","template weights","interconnection neighbourhoods","high-speed scanner/halftoner","facsimile"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"Image halftoning with cellular neural networks","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4492217","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image halftoning with cellular neural networks","sourcePdf":"00224318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041934S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"74","articleId":"224318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":224350,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

This approach is based on the geometrical properties that result from the interaction between IC and defect size in two coordinate spaces: x-y and z. The approach is a natural extension to the concept of critical areas, namely, the extraction of critical volumes. Through the course of this work hints to the origins of 3D defects will be given, conditions to capture critical volumes will be developed, and it will be shown that the net effect of 3D defects is accumulated from layer to layer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432477","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1992","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling of 3-dimensional defects in integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of 3-dimensional defects in integrated circuits","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00224355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03999S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","isNumber":"5868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"414","citationCount":"4","articleId":"224355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":224358,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

This method has been a significant contributor to rapid defect learning on the 16-Mb DRAM manufacturing line at IBM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1992.224365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1992.224365","startPage":"12","endPage":"21","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/414/5868/00224365.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical inspection of wafers using large-area defect detection and sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Optical inspection of wafers using large-area defect detection and sampling","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4441728","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224365/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical inspection of wafers using large-area defect detection and sampling","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00224365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028199S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","isNumber":"5868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"414","citationCount":"4","articleId":"224365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":224369,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In order to reduce the search time, the authors propose to apply a three phase procedure. In the first phase, they suggest using a heuristic to find good, but not necessarily optimal, feasible cover for the faulty array. Only if the heuristic method fails to generate a feasible cover, the array is examined to find out whether it is repairable at all. If deemed economical, repairable chips will undergo an exhaustive analysis. This three phase strategy can considerably reduce the average time for repair analysis. Searching for a good heuristic to be applied in phase 1, the authors investigated the fault distribution pattern on the faulty array and considered the effect of a row or column replacement on this fault distribution. Accordingly, a k degree fault spectrum for a bipartite graph is defined and a maximum spectrum is introduced as a heuristic for selecting vertices. They prove that the vertices which are most likely to be included in the feasible cover will be selected by heuristic. Consequently, a fast method to generate a feasible cover is proposed and a suitable algorithm is developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1992.224369","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/414/5868/00224369.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1992.224369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault spectrum analysis for fast spare allocation in reconfigurable arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Fault spectrum analysis for fast spare allocation in reconfigurable arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224369/","publicationDate":"1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4441733","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault spectrum analysis for fast spare allocation in reconfigurable arrays","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00224369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036464S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","isNumber":"5868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"414","citationCount":"9","articleId":"224369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":224374,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Even though RERO-k was suggested as an extension of recomputation with shifted operands by k bits (RESO-k), the RERO implementation for arithmetic operations and its application to carry lookahead adders have not been shown. It is claimed that complex control units should be used to make RERO feasible. This control hardware may add additional faults which are different from the bit-slice faults in the ALU. In this approach, by adding only one spare bit slice in the arithmetic logic unit, RERO is possible for error detection of logical and arithmetic operations in either ripple carry adders and carry lookahead adders without any additional hardware control unit. Proof will be given that RERO-k can detect (k mod n) consecutive errors in logical operations and (k mod (n+1)-1) consecutive errors in arithmetic operations, where n is the length of the original arithmetic logic unit. This demonstrates that RERO preserves all the error detection features of RESO. With less hardware, time redundancy and more flexibility for error detection, the approach makes RERO more appropriate for VLSI designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Hardware","Logic","Computer errors","Very large scale integration","Error analysis","Digital arithmetic","Error correction","Fault detection","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","bit-slice computers","digital arithmetic","redundancy","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recomputing","rotated operands","concurrent error detection","bit slice","RERO","arithmetic operations","ripple carry adders","carry lookahead adders","logical operations","time redundancy","VLSI designs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224374","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1992.224374","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/414/5868/00224374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1992.224374","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5868","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1992 IEEE International Workshop on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent error detection in ALUs by recomputing with rotated operands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent error detection in ALUs by recomputing with rotated operands","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4441738","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent error detection in ALUs by recomputing with rotated operands","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00224374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021828S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","isNumber":"5868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"414","citationCount":"22","articleId":"224374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":224376,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Moreover, several authors have dealt with the problem of fault tolerance; whether such aim is achieved by techniques typical of the neural computation (e.g. by repeated learning) or by architecture-specific solutions, the first basic step consists clearly in diagnosing the faulty elements. The present paper suggests adoption of concurrent error detection; the granularity chosen to identify faults is that of the neuron. An approach based on a class of arithmetic codes is suggested; various different solutions are discussed, and their relative performances and costs are evaluated. To check the validity of the approach, its application is examined with reference to multi-layered feed-forward networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224376/","accessionNumber":"4441740","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Arithmetic codes for concurrent error detection in artificial neural networks: the case of AN+B codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arithmetic codes for concurrent error detection in artificial neural networks: the case of AN+B codes","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00224376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032169S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov 1992","isNumber":"5868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"414","citationCount":"12","articleId":"224376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":224443,"authors":[{"name":"A.J. van de Goor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"A.J.","lastName":"van de Goor","id":"37273366000"},{"name":"Y.

It is however, well known that the present practice of automatic reclosure after a fixed dead time can pose problems. In this respect, adaptive autoreclosure techniques, whereby a control logic system ascertains whether (or precisely when) to reclose the circuit breakers, offer a very attractive alternative. This paper is concerned with describing one such technique in which neural networks are employed in designing a circuit breaker control system. It is shown that by using sufficient training examples from accurate simulations of fault situations, it is possible to create a neural network which can recognise certain situations and give a good decision of whether and when to reclose.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/1186/5871/00224540.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Fifth International Conference on Developments in Power System Protection","publicationTitle":"1993 Fifth International Conference on Developments in Power System Protection","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of neural network techniques to adaptive autoreclosure in protection equipment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"The application of neural network techniques to adaptive autoreclosure in protection equipment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4418243","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of neural network techniques to adaptive autoreclosure in protection equipment","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"00224540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047305S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"5871","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1186","citationCount":"2","articleId":"224540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":224637,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

It has become possible to extend the range of unrepeatered systems operating at 1.55 mu m to about 300-400 km. The next generation of optical systems, TAT12/13 and TPC5, which are planned for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in 1995/6 will use optical amplifiers and operate at 5 Gbit/s per fibre pair. The authors look at constraints on the operation of long haul optically amplified systems and suggest areas where progress needs to be made in order to allow operation at rates beyond 5 Gbit/s. Gordon-Haus jitter and provision of an adequate SNR have been recognised as the limiting factors for soliton systems. However, guiding filters may allow these constraints to be relaxed and higher speed operation achieved. Soliton systems may also offer the promise of multi-channel operation using either two polarisation states or a few WDM channels. The latter requires that the gain of each wavelength channel can be adequately controlled.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872","publicationTitle":"Fourth IEE Conference on Telecommunications 1993","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth IEE Conference on Telecommunications 1993","pdfPath":"/iel3/1184/5872/00224637.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The future of optically amplified submarine systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"The future of optically amplified submarine systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 April 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4427637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The future of optically amplified submarine systems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"00224637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031748S","chronDate":"18-21 Apr 1993","isNumber":"5872","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1184","citationCount":"4","articleId":"224637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":224670,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

The improvements obtained by introducing the wideband absorbing boundary conditions and the use of the Prony method are shown clearly analysing diverse dielectric discontinuities in waveguides.

This architecture is particularly suited to FDTD since it avoids the communications bottleneck which other parallel implementations of FDTD have encountered. The mapping technique presented is not problem-dependent and has an enormous speed advantage. This gives rise to the possibility of incorporating FDTD into a integrated circuit and layout simulation tool and allows far more complex problems to be analysed within realistic processing times. The mapping is described in detail and then equations are derived for the processing time required for each part of the algorithm. A general method for predicting the time taken for a given problem is obtained from these equations. The particular case of a microchip low-pass filter is used to illustrate the size of the improvements possible with the new mapping when compared with a conventional computer architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Eighth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel3/1182/5873/00224682.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"599 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1993 Eighth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid solution of the finite difference time domain method using parallel associative techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FDTD methods","Low-pass filters","Parallel processing","Stripline components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","finite difference time-domain analysis","low-pass filters","parallel processing","strip line components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM boundary value problems","finite difference time domain method","mapping FDTD","parallel architecture","associative string processor","microchip low-pass filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Rapid solution of the finite difference time domain method using parallel associative techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4432771","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid solution of the finite difference time domain method using parallel associative techniques","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"00224682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041085S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"5873","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1182","citationCount":"2","articleId":"224682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":224750,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

Next, those beams whose received signals have sufficient level are selected. The weights of only these selected beams are optimized in an adaptive loop. The BSCMA adaptive array antenna is useful in mobile satellite communications, because the number of interferences that need to be considered is smaller than the number of elements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Eighth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel3/1182/5873/00224758.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873","publicationTitle":"1993 Eighth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"975","endPage":"978 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam space constant modulus algorithm adaptive array antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=224758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Beam space constant modulus algorithm adaptive array antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/224758/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4427490","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam space constant modulus algorithm adaptive array antennas","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"00224758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023786S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"5873","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1182","citationCount":"11","articleId":"224758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":224765,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

The arm can reach targets without prior geometric calibration. All control signal effects are learned by the controller through visual observation during a training period and refined during actual operation. Minor changes in the system's configuration result in a brief period of degraded performance while the controller adapts (in real time) to the new mappings. It is shown that a neural-network-based controller can perform accurately, taking into account the nonlinearities of various transformations. Such a controller is easy to train, tolerant of imprecise equipment configurations, and insensitive to camera perturbations following training.

The phase compensation corrects ping-to-ping incoherence due to both medium and vehicle motion instabilities over the integration period of the synthetic aperture, thereby improving image quality. The phase compensation technique was evaluated using both simulated hydrophone data and acoustic test tank data at 550 kHz. General-purpose beamformers have been developed to allow side by side comparison of physical aperture and synthetic aperture images processed from the same set of hydrophone data.

The spacecraft and scientific instrument configuration is presented. The orbit of SAMPEX has an altitude of 520 by 670 km and an 82 degrees inclination. Maximum possible power is provided by articulated solar arrays that point continuously toward the sun. Highly sensitive scientific instruments point generally toward the local zenith, especially over the terrestrial poles, in order to measure optimally the galactic and solar cosmic ray flux. Energetic magnetospheric particle precipitation is monitored at lower geomagnetic latitudes. The spacecraft uses several innovative approaches including an optical fiber bus, powerful onboard computers, and large solid state memories (instead of tape recorders).

With its large geometric factor of 60 cm/sup 2/ sr the sensor is optimized to provide compositional and spectral measurements for low-intensity cosmic rays, i.e., for small solar energetic particle events and for the anomalous component of cosmic rays. The instrument combines a large-area ion-drift-chamber-proportional-counter system with two arrays of 16 Li-drifted solid state detectors and 16 CsI crystals. The multi-dE/dx-E technique provides a low-background mass and energy determination. The sensor also measures particle direction. By combining these measurements with the information on the spacecraft position and attitude in the low-altitude polar orbit, it will be possible to infer the ionic charge of the ions from the local cutoff of the Earth's magnetic field. The ionic charge in this energy range is of particular interest because it provides unique clues to the origin of these particles and has not been investigated systematically so far.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/5882/00225520.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.225520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.225520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HILT: a heavy ion large area proportional counter telescope for solar and anomalous cosmic rays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Counting circuits","Telescopes","Extraterrestrial measurements","Magnetic field measurement","Energy measurement","Particle measurements","Cosmic rays","Nuclear measurements","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cosmic ray apparatus","cosmic ray composition","cosmic ray energy spectra","position sensitive particle detectors","proportional counters","semiconductor counters","solar cosmic ray particles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Sun","solar cosmic rays","SAMPEX position sensitive detectors","HILT","heavy ion large area proportional counter telescope","anomalous cosmic rays","elemental abundances","energy spectra","direction of incidence","geometric factor","low-intensity cosmic rays","ion-drift-chamber-proportional-counter system","Li-drifted solid state detectors","multi-dE/dx-E technique","ionic charge","local cutoff","4 to 250 MeV","CsI","Li"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"HILT: a heavy ion large area proportional counter telescope for solar and anomalous cosmic rays","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4505441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HILT: a heavy ion large area proportional counter telescope for solar and anomalous cosmic rays","sourcePdf":"00225520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06202S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"69","articleId":"225520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":225521,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Finally, PET has limited capability to identify energetic positrons from potential natural and man-made sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.225523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/5882/00225523.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"571","doi":"10.1109/36.225523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PET: a proton/electron telescope for studies of magnetospheric, solar, and galactic particles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"PET: a proton/electron telescope for studies of magnetospheric, solar, and galactic particles","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4505444","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PET: a proton/electron telescope for studies of magnetospheric, solar, and galactic particles","sourcePdf":"00225523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063968S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"105","articleId":"225523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":225524,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The comparisons of the algorithms were done using a realistic database, consisting of approximately 90000 Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper pixels. The binary diamond and the nearest neighbor performances were close, with some advantages to the binary diamond. The performance of the back-propagation network lagged behind.

It is shown, via a simulation study, that the spatial or spectral context contribution is sensitive to image parameters such as homogeneity, means, variances, and spatial or spectral correlations of the noise. From this one may choose the best context contribution according to the estimated values of the above parameters. The parameter estimation is done by SEM, a densities mixture estimator which is a stochastic variant of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm. Another simulation study shows good robustness of the SEM algorithm with respect to different image parameters. Thus, modification of the behavior of the contextual methods, when the SEM-based unsupervised approaches are considered, is limited, and the conclusions of the supervised simulation study stay valid. An adaptive unsupervised method using more relevant contextual features is proposed. Different SEM-based unsupervised contextual segmentation methods, applied to two real SPOT images, give consistently better results than a classical histogram-based method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.225529","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/5882/00225529.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.225529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEM algorithm and unsupervised statistical segmentation of satellite images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225529/","displayDocTitle":"SEM algorithm and unsupervised statistical segmentation of satellite images","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4505450","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEM algorithm and unsupervised statistical segmentation of satellite images","sourcePdf":"00225529.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059984S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"124","articleId":"225529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":225531,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

The first stage is a modified form of linear prediction with discrete coefficients, and the second stage is bilevel sequence coding. The linear predictor generates an error or residue sequence in a way such that exact reconstruction of the original data sequence can be accomplished with a simple algorithm. The residue sequence is essentially white Gaussian with seismic or other similar waveform data. Bilevel sequence coding, in which two sample sizes are chosen and the residue sequence is encoded into subsequences that alternate from one level to the other, further compresses the residue sequence. The algorithm is lossless, allowing exact, bit-for-bit recovery of the original data sequence. The performance of the algorithm at each stage is analyzed. Applications of the two-stage technique to typical seismic data indicates that an average number of compressed bits per sample close to the lower bound is achievable in practical situations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation losses","Data compression","Discrete Fourier transforms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Laboratories","Performance analysis","Narrowband","Information retrieval","Fourier transforms","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","linear predictive coding","seismology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage technique","lossless waveform data compression","linear prediction","discrete coefficients","bilevel sequence coding","error","residue sequence","reconstruction","data sequence","algorithm","bit-for-bit recovery","performance","seismic data"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.225531","startPage":"645","endPage":"654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/5882/00225531.pdf","doi":"10.1109/36.225531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless compression of waveform data for efficient storage and transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Lossless compression of waveform data for efficient storage and transmission","accessionNumber":"4505452","publicationDate":"May 1993","volume":"31","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless compression of waveform data for efficient storage and transmission","sourcePdf":"00225531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040766S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"61","articleId":"225531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":225536,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The reconstruction algorithm is described, and the technique is demonstrated using both simulated and actual Seasat-A Scatterometer (SASS) measurements. The technique can also be used with ERS-1 scatterometer data. The SASS-derived images, which have approximately 4-km resolution, illustrate the resolution enhancement capability of the technique, which permits utilization of both historic and contemporary scatterometer data for medium-scale monitoring of vegetation and polar ice.

The leakage current is comparable to that of convection stacked capacitors (STCs).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4510968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"14","issue":"8","displayDocTitle":"The honeycomb-shape capacitor structure for ULSI DRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The honeycomb-shape capacitor structure for ULSI DRAM","sourcePdf":"00225582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035213S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"5885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"4","articleId":"225582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225591,"authors":[{"name":"J.

RBF training is performed after the HMM recognizer has automatically segmented training tokens using forced Viterbi alignment. In recognition experiments using a speaker-independent E-set database, the hybrid recognizer had an error rate of 11.5% compared to 15.7% for the robust unimodal Gaussian HMM recognizer upon which the hybrid system was based. The error rate was also lower than that of a tied-mixture HMM recognizer with the same number of centers. These results demonstrate that RBF networks can be successfully incorporated in hybrid recognizers and suggest that they may be capable of good performance with fewer parameters than required by Gaussian mixture classifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225830","startPage":"629","endPage":"632 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225830.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A speech recognizer using radial basis function neural networks in an HMM framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Radial basis function networks","Hidden Markov models","Error analysis","Neural networks","Automatic speech recognition","Bayesian methods","Decoding","Viterbi algorithm","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","hidden Markov models","neural nets","speech recognition equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unimodal Gaussian recognition","radial basis function neural networks","HMM framework","speaker-independent isolated-word speech recognizer","hidden Markov models","RBF networks","discriminant training techniques","Bayesian probabilities","speech frame","forced Viterbi alignment","speaker-independent E-set database","error rate","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A speech recognizer using radial basis function neural networks in an HMM framework","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","accessionNumber":"4437241","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A speech recognizer using radial basis function neural networks in an HMM framework","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034409S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"21","articleId":"225830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":225831,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In particular, the authors developed a system that combines the SNN with a hidden Markov model (HMM) system. In a speaker-independent, 1000-word CSR test using a word-pair grammar, the error rate for the hybrid system dropped 25% from that of a state-of-the-art HMM system alone. By taking into account all the frames of a phonetic segment simultaneously, the SNN overcomes the well-known conditional-independence limitation of HMMs. The hybrid SNN/HMM system generates likely phonetic segmentations from the HMM N-best list, which are scored by the SNN.

The author shows how MS-TDNNs deal with these issues in a simple and efficient way, and achieve state of the art performance on several tasks representative of different problems in speaker-independent speech recognition: telephone digits and connected spelled letters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225832.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"624 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectionist word-level classification in speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225832","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Connectionist word-level classification in speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4437239","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectionist word-level classification in speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053211S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"3","articleId":"225832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225834,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

The authors have experimented with SSNN on a task of recognizing 25 words (city names) recorded from actual customers over the telephone network. Comparisons show that context-dependent modeling can reduce the error rate quite substantially.

The method is illustrated via an experiment to build a set of generalized triphone models for the TIMIT database in which triphones are constructed by joining together left and right dependent biphones. Although simple, the method results in good performance and avoids the need to train large numbers of triphones. The use of tying to increase model robustness is also investigated. Tying the center states within triphones of the same phoneme class and tying variances within states is beneficial, but larger-scale tying of variances leads to degraded performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225844","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225844.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"572 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The general use of tying in phoneme-based HMM speech recognisers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225844/","displayDocTitle":"The general use of tying in phoneme-based HMM speech recognisers","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432329","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The general use of tying in phoneme-based HMM speech recognisers","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031565S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"53","articleId":"225844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225847,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

This resulted in a best test set error rate of 2.8% from a system that required only half the computation of the baseline.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225860","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225860.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"512 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov models using vector linear prediction and discriminative output distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225860/","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov models using vector linear prediction and discriminative output distributions","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432314","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov models using vector linear prediction and discriminative output distributions","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026877S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"17","articleId":"225860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":225861,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The work presented is a continuation of work previously described by the authors (see Proc. 1991 IEEE Inf. Conf. on Acoust. Speech and Sign. Process., pp.533-536). The main differences are: (1) use of the 20-kHz TI/NIST corpus available on CD-ROM (instead of the 10-kHz distribution tape), (2) use of word models (instead of sub-word units), (3) addition of second derivative parameters, and (4) a more elaborate training procedure for codebook exponents. The experiments described were all performed on the complete adult portion of the corpus. The baseline system, using discrete HMMs and MMIE, has a 0.67% word error rate and a 2.03% string error rate. The authors describe techniques that allowed them to improve greatly the recognition rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225861.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"508 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance connected digit recognition using codebook exponents","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Hidden Markov models","Topology","Speech recognition","CD-ROMs","NIST","Cepstral analysis","Availability","Mutual information","Technological innovation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","information theory","speech coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HMM","speaker independent recognition","connected digit recognition","codebook exponents","speech research","CRIM","hidden Markov models","maximum mutual information estimation","TI/NIST corpus","CD-ROM","word models","second derivative parameters","training procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"High performance connected digit recognition using codebook exponents","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432313","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance connected digit recognition using codebook exponents","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039171S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"7","articleId":"225861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":225862,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

The algorithm can be viewed as generalized learning vector quantization suited to the dynamic programming-based time warping.

A series of speaker independent recognition experiments using the highly confusing English E-set as the vocabulary was conducted to examine the characteristics of the GPD method for discriminative training. Without ad hoc supplementary schemes, the method achieved a recognition rate of 83.7%, a remarkable performance improvement compared to 63.8% with the traditional template training via clustering.

The second algorithm, vocabulary-bias training, gives the relevant allophones more prominence by assigning more weight to them during Baum-Welch training of the generalized allophonic models and reduces the VI error rate by 15%. Finally, in order to overcome the degradation caused by the different acoustic environments used for VI training and testing, codebook-dependent cepstral normalization (CDCN) and interpolated SNR-dependent cepstral normalization (ISDCN) originally designed for microphone adaptation are incorporated into the VI system, and both reduce the degradation of VI cross-environment recognition by 50%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225866.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"488 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vocabulary learning and environment normalization in vocabulary-independent speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Vocabulary learning and environment normalization in vocabulary-independent speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432308","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vocabulary learning and environment normalization in vocabulary-independent speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0334S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"3","articleId":"225866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225869,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Based on speaker-dependent models, performance evaluation showed that speaker normalization significantly reduced the error rate from 41.9% to 5.0%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432303","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speaker normalization for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker normalization for speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056973S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"17","articleId":"225871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":225877,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Low-level tied LVQ phoneme models are trained speaker-dependently and independently, yielding a pool of speaker-biased phoneme models which can be mixed into high-level speaker-adaptive phoneme models. Rapid speaker adaptation is performed by finding an optimal mixture for these models at recognition time, given only a small amount of speech data; subsequently, the models are fine-tuned to the new speaker's voice by further parameter reestimation. In preliminary experiments with a continuous speech task using 40 context-free phoneme models at task perplexity 111, the authors achieved 82% word accuracy for speaker-dependent recognition and 73% in the speaker-adaptive mode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225877.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"444 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LVQ based reference model for speaker-adaptive speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Vector quantization","Context modeling","Neural networks","Computer science","Adaptation model","Probability distribution","System testing","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech recognition","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker-dependent training","speaker-independent training","speaker-adaptive speech recognition","hierarchical phoneme model","hidden Markov models","HMM","learned vector quantization","tied LVQ phoneme models","speaker-biased phoneme models","high-level speaker-adaptive phoneme models","optimal mixture","recognition time","speech data","parameter reestimation","continuous speech task","context-free phoneme models","perplexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"An LVQ based reference model for speaker-adaptive speech recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432297","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LVQ based reference model for speaker-adaptive speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225877.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028613S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"14","articleId":"225877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225878,"authors":[{"name":"B.F.

In speaker-dependent recognition experiments with perplexity 111, the current versions of the LPNN and HCNN-CDF systems achieve 60% and 75% word recognition accuracies, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225888","startPage":"397","endPage":"400 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225888.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-dependent hidden control neutral network architecture for continuous speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Vocabulary","Context modeling","Automatic speech recognition","Neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Computer architecture","Computer science","Artificial neural networks","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context dependent","hidden control neutral network architecture","continuous speech recognition","vocabulary","phoneme model","linked predictive neural network","speaker-dependent recognition experiments","word recognition accuracies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Context-dependent hidden control neutral network architecture for continuous speech recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","accessionNumber":"4432286","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-dependent hidden control neutral network architecture for continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094036S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"4","articleId":"225888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225889,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In the traditional HMM algorithms, the probability of duration of a state decreases exponentially with time which is not appropriate for representing the temporal structure of speech. Non-parametric modeling of duration using semi-Markov chains does accomplish the task with a large increase in the computational complexity. Applying a postprocessing state duration penalty after Viterbi decoding adds very little computation but does not affect the forward recognition path. The authors present a way of modeling state durations in HMM using time-dependent state transitions. This inhomogeneous HMM (IHMM) does increase the computation by a small amount but reduces recognition error rates by 14-25%. Also, a suboptimal implementation of this scheme that requires no more computation than the traditional HMM is presented which also has reduced errors by 14-22% on a variety of databases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432282","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"Modeling state durations in hidden Markov models for automatic speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling state durations in hidden Markov models for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043419S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"33","articleId":"225892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225893,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A particular type of stochastic modeling based on first-order hidden Markov models (HMMs), has been increasingly popular, because it has a solid theoretical basis and offers practical advantages. The authors extend the standard HMM theory to parallel hidden Markov models (PHMMs). The parallel model consists of two statistically related HMMs. This configuration has mixture densities of HMM observations whose weights can be made variable depending on the probability of other HMMs being in certain states. This allows one to dynamically adapt observation statistics to acoustic contexts. Some preliminary experiments have been carried out in order to compare the PHMMs with standard HMMs and the results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of parallel hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225893","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225893.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"380 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A family of parallel hidden Markov models","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432281","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of parallel hidden Markov models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030546S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"5","articleId":"225893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225912,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

To combat this problem, the authors proposed in a previous study a distortion measure that takes into account the norm shrinkage bias in the noisy cepstrum. The authors incorporate a first-order equalization mechanism, specifically aimed at avoiding the norm shrinkage problem, in a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to model the speech cepstral sequence. Such a modeling technique requires special care as the formulation inevitably involves parameter estimation from a set of data with singular dispersion. The authors provide solutions to this HMM stochastic modeling problem and give algorithms for estimating the necessary model parameters. They experimentally show that incorporation of the first-order normal equalization model makes the HMM-based speech recognizer robust to noise. With respect to a conventional HMM recognizer, this leads to an improvement in recognition performance which is equivalent to about 15-20-dB gain in signal-to-noise ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225912","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225912.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"304 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector equalization in hidden Markov models for noisy speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225912/","displayDocTitle":"Vector equalization in hidden Markov models for noisy speech recognition","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432262","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector equalization in hidden Markov models for noisy speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039716S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"1","articleId":"225912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225915,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Several new aspects are introduced: use of enhanced nonlinear spectral subtraction (NSS) schemes, introduction of root-MFCC parameters, use of dynamic features, and training of HMMs by a dynamic inference scheme (DIHMM). These enhancements are discussed from tests performed on bandlimited signals (200-3000 Hz). The authors show that these various optimizations allow a rise from 20% to over 99% in performance.

The authors compare the recognition accuracy, computational complexity, and amount of training data needed to adapt to new acoustical environments using these algorithms with several different types of headset-mounted and desktop microphones.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225923.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"260 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient joint compensation of speech for the effects of additive noise and linear filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Additive noise","Maximum likelihood detection","Microphones","Cepstral analysis","Automatic speech recognition","System testing","Speech recognition","Acoustic testing","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","compensation","computational complexity","filtering and prediction theory","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint compensation","additive noise","linear filtering","robustness","automatic speech recognition systems","workstations","SNR-dependent cepstral normalization","fixed code-word dependent cepstral normalization","computationally-efficient environment normalization","CDCN algorithm","recognition accuracy","computational complexity","training data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Efficient joint compensation of speech for the effects of additive noise and linear filtering","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432251","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient joint compensation of speech for the effects of additive noise and linear filtering","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077607S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"17","articleId":"225923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225924,"authors":[{"name":"M.Q.

The foreground speech is modeled by a set of left-to-right isolated word HMMs trained on a small isolated word database, and the background speech is modeled by a parallel ergodic HMM trained on a subset of TIMIT. The standard output approximation (OA) method of estimating the output probability distributions is used, and compared with a simple model combination (MC) technique. Recent work in this area has shown the effectiveness of vocabulary-specific background speech models, and hence this is used as a baseline. The results show that the general ergodic background model is as effective as a vocabulary-specific model.

High-quality speech successfully generated by time-scale modification shows that the reconstruction method is suitable for various applications as well as making experimental auditory stimuli.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225966","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225966.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal reconstruction from modified wavelet transform-An application to auditory signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225966/","displayDocTitle":"Signal reconstruction from modified wavelet transform-An application to auditory signal processing","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432208","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal reconstruction from modified wavelet transform-An application to auditory signal processing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024483S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"2","articleId":"225966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225979,"authors":[{"name":"M.Y.

How to capture important clues and estimate those needed parameters reliably is one of the central issues in speech recognition. Successful examples include subword models, fenones and many other smoothing techniques. In comparison with subword models, subphonetic modeling may provide a finer level of details. The authors propose to model subphonetic events with Markov states and treat the state in phonetic hidden Markov models as the basic subphonetic unit-senone. Senones generalize fenones in several ways. A word model is a concatenation of senones and senones can be shared across different word models. Senone models not only allow parameter sharing, but also enable pronunciation optimization. The authors report preliminary senone modeling results, which have significantly reduced the word error rate for speaker-independent continuous speech recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225979","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225979.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subphonetic modeling with Markov states-Senone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225979/","displayDocTitle":"Subphonetic modeling with Markov states-Senone","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432195","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subphonetic modeling with Markov states-Senone","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051807S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"33","articleId":"225979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":225980,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The authors describe a highly accurate fast acoustic match for continuous speech recognition. The algorithm uses allophonic models and efficient search techniques to select a set of candidate words. The allophonic models are derived by constructing decision trees that query the context in which each phone occurs to arrive at an allophone in a given context. The models for all the words in the vocabulary are arranged in a tree structure and efficient tree search algorithms are used to select a list of candidate words using these models.

Once the highest ranking models are identified, all other match scores are discarded. The authors propose to make use of all computed scores by means of statistical inference. They view the match between an incoming acoustic string s and a model M/sub i/ as a random variable Y/sub i/. The class-conditioning distributions of (Y/sub 1/,. . .Y/sub N/) can be studied offline by sampling, and then used in a variety of ways. For example, the means of these distributions give rise to a natural measure of distance between models. One of the most useful applications of these distributions is as a basis for a new Bayesian classifier. The latter can be used to significantly reduce search effort in large vocabularies, and to quickly obtain a short list of candidate words. An example hidden Markov model (HMM)-based system shows promising results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225986","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5894/00225986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.225986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5894","startPage":"5","endPage":"8 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting correlations among competing models with application to large vocabulary speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=225986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting correlations among competing models with application to large vocabulary speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/225986/","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4432188","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting correlations among competing models with application to large vocabulary speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00225986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041447S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","articleId":"225986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":225987,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The detection is performed in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain, where the presence of a transient is indicated by a peak at a location that depends on the values of the dilation and translation parameters. By choosing these parameters appropriately one can control the sharpness of this peak as well as the distance between different peaks that correspond to different arrival times. As a result, transients that partially overlap in time can be resolved in the DWT domain. The DWT domain preserves the arrival time information even when the transient is corrupted by additive zero-mean noise at a very low signal-to-noise ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226016.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"480 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of transients using discrete wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Gaussian noise","Signal resolution","Additive noise","Signal to noise ratio","Wavelet domain","Gaussian processes","Statistics","Signal representations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","transients","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient signal detection","SNR","dilation parameters","discrete wavelet transform","arrival times","translation parameters","additive zero-mean noise","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Detection of transients using discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4441496","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of transients using discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064151S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"10","articleId":"226016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226020,"authors":[{"name":"H.S.

In general, the received signal may contain both strong and weak path receptions.

In this study, the strong paths were regarded as the unwanted signals which must be eliminated in order to detect the weaker paths. The proposed method is a simple yet effective means for eliminating the ambiguities associated with the strong paths without significantly affecting the weak paths. This method has the advantage that removing the strong paths at a single Doppler channel is equivalent to removing the entire floor level associated with the strong paths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226020.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"464 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of weak, broadband signals under Doppler-scaled, multipath propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Narrowband","Noise cancellation","Delay","Noise level","Reverberation","Frequency","Equations","Doppler radar","Filling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler effect","radiowave propagation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband signal detection","strong path reception","weak signal","Doppler scaled multipath propagation","received signal","weak path receptions","ambiguities","floor level","2-D sidelobes","Doppler channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Detection of weak, broadband signals under Doppler-scaled, multipath propagation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4441492","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of weak, broadband signals under Doppler-scaled, multipath propagation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033819S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"6","articleId":"226020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":226023,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The object is first parametrically represented by a surface reconstruction neural network (SRNN) trained by the boundary points sampled from the exemplar object. When later presented with a distorted object, this parametric representation reduces the effects caused by detection/occlusion and also allows the mismatch information backpropagated through the SRNN to iteratively determine the best similarity transform of the distorted object.

The goal of this work is to overcome the limits that reduce the possibility of a hardware implementation of the schemes already presented in the literature. The limits principally concern the complexity of the implementation in real time of the classical Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm, which is necessary to introduce some adaptive capabilities in a VQ. Neural network methods, because of their fast codebook design, seem an interesting alternative to solve this problem. The authors have used an unsupervised neural network approach to introduce adaptivity in a vector quantizer by using a codebook replenishment method. The proposed adaptive VQ algorithm has been tested in a motion compensated interframe image coding scheme. The results of the simulations are very promising. A considerable rise of the coder performance with respect to the use of fixed VQ has been obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226038/","accessionNumber":"4441474","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approach for adaptive vector quantization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approach for adaptive vector quantization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04966S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","articleId":"226038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":226041,"authors":[{"name":"L.E.

It is assumed that the network has one output unit for each keyword to be detected, and that features of the speech signal are input at fixed intervals. The goal of training is to obtain a network that emits a detection pulse at the appropriate output unit when the utterance of a keyword is completed. The authors have developed a successful backpropagation strategy which incorporates 'don't care' targets for outputs expected to be in the process of rising or falling, propagation of errors for only a subset of those times at which no detection pulse is expected, iterative refinement of the temporal placement of target outputs, and use of a super-squared error criterion. In an application of the strategy to speaker-dependent, continuous digit recognition (i.e., digit spotting with no utterances of nondigits), word-error rates of 0% and 2.5% were achieved for the training and test utterances, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226046","startPage":"357","endPage":"360 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226046.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back-propagation training of a neural network for word spotting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Speech","Computer science","Signal generators","Signal processing","Feedforward systems","Testing","Airplanes","Information retrieval","Vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["errors propagation","neural network","word spotting","backpropagation training","detection pulse","keyword","continuous digit recognition","word-error rates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Back-propagation training of a neural network for word spotting","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","accessionNumber":"4441466","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back-propagation training of a neural network for word spotting","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02973S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"3","articleId":"226046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":226048,"authors":[{"name":"H.

All of these systems have exclusively used context-independent phonetic models, in the sense that the probabilities or costs are estimated for simple speech units such as phonemes or words, rather than biphones or triphones. Numerous conventional systems based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been reported that use triphone or triphone like context-dependent models. In one case the outputs of many context-dependent MLPs (one per context class) were used to help choose the best sentence from the N best sentences as determined by a context-dependent HMM system. It is shown how, without any simplifying assumptions, one can estimate likelihoods for context-dependent phonetic models with nets that are not substantially larger than context-independent MLPs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4441464","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CDNN: a context dependent neural network for continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDNN: a context dependent neural network for continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041937S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"28","articleId":"226048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":226051,"authors":[{"name":"T.R.

Improvement in recognition accuracy due to training the delay characteristics is demonstrated using a multispeaker digit database.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226064","startPage":"285","endPage":"288 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning the time-delay characteristics in a neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226064/","displayDocTitle":"Learning the time-delay characteristics in a neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4441448","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the time-delay characteristics in a neural network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039166S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","articleId":"226064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":226068,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The criteria for adding a new basis function to the model are based on the angle formed between a new basis function and the existing basis functions and also on the prediction error. When a new basis function is not added the model parameters are adapted by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm. This model is similar to the resource allocating network (RAN) and hence this work provides an alternative interpretation to the RAN. An enhancement to the RAN is suggested where RAN is combined with EKF. The RAN and its variants are applied to the task of predicting the logistic map and the Mackey-Glass chaotic time-series, and the advantages of the enhanced model are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226068","startPage":"269","endPage":"272 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226068.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models of dynamic complexity for time-series prediction (neural networks)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226068/","displayDocTitle":"Models of dynamic complexity for time-series prediction (neural networks)","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4441444","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models of dynamic complexity for time-series prediction (neural networks)","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08507S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"5","articleId":"226068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226074,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The authors describe a real-time AC-2 stereo digital audio decoder implementation based on one 16-b TMS320C5x DSP. This is achieved by modifying a conventional inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) computation, using a form of mixed-precision arithmetic, and exploiting the short instruction cycle time of the DSP. Compared with a 16-b single-precision implementation, a moderate increase in required DSP cycle time is incurred. The results indicate that the dynamic range of the 16-b DSP decoder is currently within 1 to 3dB of that obtained by current high-quality 16-b A/D and D/A converters. A further refinement will produce a dynamic range figure which meets or exceeds that obtained by higher-precision fixed-point ALUs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low cost adaptive transform decoder implementation for high-quality audio","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226087","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226087.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A low cost adaptive transform decoder implementation for high-quality audio","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4441425","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low cost adaptive transform decoder implementation for high-quality audio","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046958S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"7","articleId":"226087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226097,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Therefore, the predictive neural network, which is a nonlinear prediction model based on multilayer perceptrons, is expected to be a more suitable model for representing speaker individuality. For text-independent speaker recognition, an ergodic model which allows transitions to any other state is adopted as the speaker model and one predictive neural network is assigned to each state. The proposed method was compared to distortion-based methods, hidden Markov model (HMM)-based methods, and a discriminative neural-network-based method through text-independent speaker recognition experiments on 24 female speakers.

In all of these scenarios, anywhere from 25 to 78 examplars per keyword have been used to train the subword acoustic HMMs that are used in the word spotter. In most word spotting applications it is simply not possible to collect such a large number of spoken utterances for all the keywords in the vocabulary every time the system is to be reconfigured for a given task.

In addition, an algorithm for speaker adaptation is described which allows indexing by a user into another talker's speech.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226111","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226111.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training and search algorithms for an interactive wordspotting system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226111/","displayDocTitle":"Training and search algorithms for an interactive wordspotting system","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4437268","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training and search algorithms for an interactive wordspotting system","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051314S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"19","articleId":"226111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226112,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Real users often embed target words in a longer utterance, and the words should be recognized as often as possible. Out-of-vocabulary utterances must be rejected. The target application is to recognize the city name query of directory assistance. Within this project, a keyword spotting algorithm has been developed which markedly improves the recognizer's performance on embedded speech. A rejection algorithm has also been implemented, and several variations on the algorithmic approach are compared with respect to their ability to reject out-of-vocabulary utterances while still accepting in-vocabulary correctly-recognized utterances. The keyword spotting and rejection algorithms are evaluated, and the factors contributing to their success are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5895/00226112.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rejection and keyword spotting algorithms for a directory assistance city name recognition application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Speech recognition","Lattices","Isolation technology","Artificial intelligence","Target recognition","Vocabulary","Natural languages","Automation","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["keyword spotting algorithms","directory assistance","city name recognition","isolated word speech recognition","embedded speech","rejection algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Rejection and keyword spotting algorithms for a directory assistance city name recognition application","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4437267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rejection and keyword spotting algorithms for a directory assistance city name recognition application","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055477S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"17","articleId":"226112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":226115,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

Previously proposed fast algorithms reduce the number of computations by limiting the number of locations that are searched to find the motion vectors of each block. The techniques presented use block and pixel subsampling to reduce the number of computations of block motion estimation. Because an exhaustive search is used to estimate a fraction of the motion vectors, these techniques are more robust than those previously proposed. Alternating the pixel subsampling patterns with the searched locations minimizes the effects of the aliasing that is introduced by subsampling the pixels without prior low-pass filtering. Block and pixel subsampling by a factor of four each reduce the computational complexity of block motion estimation by a factor of 16.

Perfect reconstruction is possible with one-pixel accuracy for motion parameters and a trivial first-order quadrature mirror filter (QMF). With comparable complexity, even this most simple type of MC-SBC outperforms MC prediction (MC-DPCM) techniques when blockwise motion estimation is used. The concept of MC-SBC is generalized to subpixel accuracy of MC and any even-length (odd-order) QMF filters. Motion estimation is performed in a hierarchical forward-backward procedure which gives better SNR and visual performance results than blockwise-independent estimation. The scheme is extremely error resistant due to its nonrecursive structure; the gain over MC-DPCM is remarkably high, especially in layered coding schemes as they are discussed for ATM video applications.

Although direct application of the optimality principle reduced the computational complexity somewhat, the DPW (or image alignment) problem is exponential in the dimensions of the image. It is shown that by applying constraints to the image alignment problem, e.g., limiting the class of possible distortions, one can reduce the computational complexity dramatically, and find the optimal solution to the constrained problem in linear time. A statistical model, the planar hidden Markov model (PHMM), describing statistical properties of images is proposed. The PHMM approach was evaluated using a set of isolated handwritten digits. An overall digit recognition accuracy of 95% was achieved. It is expected that the advantage of this approach will be even more significant for harder tasks, such cursive-writing recognition and spotting.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5896/00226254.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic planar warping for optical character recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical character recognition software","Character recognition","Automatic speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Testing","Dynamic programming","Optical distortion","Computational complexity","Lattices","Handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","optical character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical character recognition","dynamic time warping","DTW","automatic speech recognition","dynamic plane warping","OCR","optimality principle","computational complexity","image alignment","distortions","constrained problem","linear time","statistical model","planar hidden Markov model","PHMM","statistical properties","handwritten digits","digit recognition accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic planar warping for optical character recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4445912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic planar warping for optical character recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035886S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"61","articleId":"226254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":226255,"authors":[{"name":"L.-X.

A linking of the output third-order cumulants of the textured image data to the estimation of the autoregressive (AR) model parameters is proposed. Through one approach, the instrumental variable is generated as the output of a moving average (MA) linear filter whose weights are chosen such that the MA filter output matches the third-order cumulants of the texture data being modeled. Generating the instrument variable in such a manner is attractive since it will be uncorrelated with the AR model measurement noise; therefore, the extracted feature vector will tend toward the optimum parameter vector. The proposed method also yields a pattern vector representing a model that captures the third-order statistics of the data. The length of the feature vector chosen for classification corresponds to the AR and MA model orders. The classification of the feature vectors was performed by a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. The network paradigm chosen was a feedforward neural net, using backpropagation learning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226272","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5896/00226272.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"80 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network recognition of textured images using third order cumulants as functional links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural network recognition of textured images using third order cumulants as functional links","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4445894","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network recognition of textured images using third order cumulants as functional links","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032202S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"1","articleId":"226272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226310,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Iterated function systems (IFS) theory provides a convenient way to describe and classify deterministic fractals in the form of a recursive definition. As a result, it is conceivable to develop image representation schemes based on the IFS parameters that correspond to a given fractal image. The authors propose the use of the wavelet transform and of the moment method for the solution of the inverse problem of recovering IFS parameters from fractal images. The redundancy of a fractal with respect to scale variation is mirrored by its wavelet decomposition, thus providing a method to estimate the scaling parameters for a class of IFSs modeling the image. Displacement parameters and probabilities are then found using the moment method. Experimental results verifying the approach are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse problem for two-dimensional fractal sets using the wavelet transform and the moment method","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226310","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226310.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"668 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Inverse problem for two-dimensional fractal sets using the wavelet transform and the moment method","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4459657","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse problem for two-dimensional fractal sets using the wavelet transform and the moment method","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036623S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"1","articleId":"226310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226311,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Time/frequency analytical tools such as the Gabor and wavelet transforms can efficiently characterize the coupling of different scales in textures, and help to overcome this difficulty. However, the conventional wavelet transform, which has a finer resolution in the lower frequency channels, does not work properly for textured images, since textures are quasi-periodic signals whose dominant frequencies are located in the middle frequency regions. In the present research, a tree-structured wavelet transform is proposed. An adaptive procedure is developed to zoom into any frequency channels with significant information so that the decomposition can be further performed. The application of the new transform to texture classification is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226311.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"664 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet transform approach to texture analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Frequency","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image texture analysis","Pixel","Remote monitoring","Image analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image texture","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","wavelet transform approach","texture analysis","image pixels","quasi-periodic signals","tree-structured wavelet transform","adaptive procedure","decomposition","texture classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet transform approach to texture analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4459656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet transform approach to texture analysis","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031841S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"13","articleId":"226311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226313,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

Wavelet transforms have been shown to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining very good image quality, because edge characteristics of images can be well preserved by this method at low bit rates. Quadtree decomposition techniques also utilize the multiresolution nature of images of a segmentation device before coding. The implementation of a novel hybrid technique for coding the coefficients of a wavelet transformation which makes use of a quadtree structure is discussed. This method is a scalar coding technique which takes advantage of the correlation between different scales in the wavelet decomposition, while requiring much less computational complexity than a comparable full search vector quantization technique described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226313","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226313.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"656 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet transform image coding technique with a quadtree structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226313/","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet transform image coding technique with a quadtree structure","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4459654","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet transform image coding technique with a quadtree structure","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032306S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"5","articleId":"226313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226314,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The authors propose a new video coding algorithm that forms a natural connection between LOTs and motion compensation using two novel concepts: overlapped motion compensation (OMC) and overlapped macroblocks using frequency domain coefficients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226314","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","startPage":"649","endPage":"652 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interframe video coding using overlapped motion compensation and perfect reconstruction filter banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interframe video coding using overlapped motion compensation and perfect reconstruction filter banks","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226314/","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4459653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interframe video coding using overlapped motion compensation and perfect reconstruction filter banks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028579S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"4","articleId":"226314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":226319,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Although, in most cases, the discrete wavelet maxima representation is unique, the conjecture about the uniqueness of the wavelet maxima representation is not true.

A partially adaptive beamformer is proposed to present desired signal cancellation. The mean squared error at the beamformer output is shown to consist of a signal cancellation term associated with the presence of interferers coherent with the desired signal and an interference cancellation term. Both terms are functions of the degrees of freedom employed in the partially adaptive beamformer. Hence, the authors propose choosing the degrees of freedom to minimize the average mean squared error over a likely set of interference scenarios.

Nevertheless, very little research is available on the finite-precision numerical effects of CORDIC, with a few notable exceptions. It is shown that CORDIC's angle coding scheme is suboptimal, which results in nonminimal approximation-error statistics. The suboptimality is quantified by simulating both CORDIC angle coding and optimal coding across the entire ROC while incrementing the number of iterations. The variances of the resulting errors are compared. It is concluded that the suboptimality is significant over only a limited range of angles.

The experimental results show that the Lena image can be coded by this coding system at the rate of 0.265 bpp to yield a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of about 29 dB. This PSNR is about 3 dB larger than that obtained by a coding system of the same rate that uses VQ to obtain the wavelet transform coefficients.

Two-level pipelined systolic arrays are dedicated and proposed for such designs. They can reach the maximum throughput rate for both clustered and scattered look-ahead. In addition, to prevent the large overhead induced in the conventional two-stage synthesis for look-ahead transfer functions, a new approach from specification to final result directly is also presented.

The difference between maximum likelihood signal estimation and maximum a posteriori signal estimation using a hidden Markov model is illustrated for a nonlinear dynamical system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4454942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling chaotic systems with hidden Markov models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling chaotic systems with hidden Markov models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037711S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"13","articleId":"226385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":226386,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

A method of identifying linear and second-order time-invariant nonlinear systems is proposed using a variation of the group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm, a polynomial network, employing a combination of quadratic polynomial and linear layers. The principal advantage of this method is that the degree of nonlinearity and the memory of the system do not have to be known a priori and are determined recursively. The GMDH method allows a Volterra series to be modeled solely from a set of input-output data. System identification using GMDH consists of applying a set of input-output data to train the network by computing the necessary coefficient sets and to select the optimum combination of these coefficient sets to obtain the model parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226386","startPage":"561","endPage":"564 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226386.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Volterra systems with a polynomial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226386/","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Volterra systems with a polynomial neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"4454941","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Volterra systems with a polynomial neural network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029765S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"12","articleId":"226386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":226391,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A method of generating an exact statistical description of the mean and mean-square convergence of the LMS algorithm with shift input data without using this assumption is described. Given input data that are independent from sample to sample, iterations are developed for expectations of products of statistically dependent filter coefficients and data samples, from which important quantities such as the excess mean-square error can be found. Monte Carlo simulations show that the exact analysis produced by this method predicts the mean-square convergence much more accurately than the analysis with the independence assumption for large step sizes, and this accuracy is maintained throughout the useful step size range of the algorithm. With this analysis, phenomena due to the coupling of filter coefficients and past data are discovered and verified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","startPage":"61","endPage":"64 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact expectation analysis of the LMS adaptive filter without the independence assumption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Exact expectation analysis of the LMS adaptive filter without the independence assumption","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4454916","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact expectation analysis of the LMS adaptive filter without the independence assumption","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034712S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"14","articleId":"226411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":226416,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The first approach is based on stochastic learning automata where the discretized values of a parameter(s) form the actions of a learning automata which then obtains the optimal parameter setting using a suitably defined error function as the feedback from the environment. The authors detail the use of improved learning schemes published elsewhere and also point out the basic shortcoming of this approach. The second approach is based on genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs have been used in the context of multiparameter optimization. Simulation results are presented to show how this approach is able to tackle the problems of dimensionality when adapting high-order filters. The effect of the differential parameters of a GA on the learning process is also demonstrated. Comparative results between a pure random search algorithm and the GA are also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226416","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226416.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"44 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic and learning automata algorithms for adaptive digital filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226416/","displayDocTitle":"Genetic and learning automata algorithms for adaptive digital filters","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4454911","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic and learning automata algorithms for adaptive digital filters","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058887S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"22","articleId":"226416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226422,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The proposed target analysis method is tested using experimentally measured radar signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226429","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","startPage":"289","endPage":"292 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target description using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Target description using wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226429/","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4451115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target description using wavelet transform","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026147S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"6","articleId":"226429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":226432,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Preliminary results show that this class of filters is much more efficient than conventional MA filters (i.e. for a given minimum mean square error (MSE) the filter order is much smaller). The authors have extended the Wiener-Hopf solution for this class of filters and have developed some design tools.

When a signal, corrupted by noise, is applied to the filter bank, it adapts to the desired (uncorrupted) signal.

It is an extension of the classical Widrow least-mean-square (LMS) noise canceler for the case of signal leakage into the noise reference. The algorithm is derived intuitively from the interpolation of the adaptive noise canceler as a decorrelator between signal estimate and noise in which the noise reference is replaced by a signal-free noise estimate. Thus, a symmetric adaptive decorrelator is obtained for signal separation, as the artificial distinction between signal and noise concepts has disappeared. The algorithm has its limitations as convergence to the desired solution and stability around it can only be guaranteed for a subclass of signal separation problems. These restrictions are rarely violated in real life problems, however, and seem to be fundamental to the signal separation problem rather than algorithm dependent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal separation in a symmetric adaptive noise canceler by output decorrelation","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226446","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5897/00226446.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"224 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Signal separation in a symmetric adaptive noise canceler by output decorrelation","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4451098","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal separation in a symmetric adaptive noise canceler by output decorrelation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038406S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"13","articleId":"226446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":226457,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

These systems are characterized by a stretching and folding within state space and by the presence of an attractor. Signal separation involves the separation of a received signal into two components, one of which is modeled as the output of a nonlinear dynamical system. The authors review previous approaches to this problem and present results from the application of Kalman filtering to the signal separation problem. A Cramer-Rao bound on the performance of a signal separation algorithm in white noise is presented.

Since classical techniques for signal analysis do not exploit the particular structure of chaotic signals there is both a significant challenge and an opportunity in exploring new classes of algorithms matched to chaotic signals. The authors outline a variety of signal processing issues associated with the analysis and synthesis of chaotic signals. In addition two examples are described in detail, illustrating some possible ways in which the characteristics of chaotic signals and systems can be exploited. One example is a binary signaling scheme using chaotic signals.

The architecture is modular and has a regular communication scheme which make the VLSI implementation rather easy and straightforward.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898","startPage":"657","endPage":"660 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5898/00226510.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI receive beamformer for digital ultrasound imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI receive beamformer for digital ultrasound imaging","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4463451","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI receive beamformer for digital ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038025S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"5","articleId":"226510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226512,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Very-fine-grain VLSI processors are especially suited for problems with a high degree of parallelism. However, to maintain their fine grainness (i.e., small size) most fine grain processors are relatively inflexible. Attempts to increase flexibility usually increase processor complexity and, thereby, decreases grainness. The two-dimensional, micrograined processor maintains both a high degree of flexibility and fine grainness by reducing each processing cell to a small RAM and several multiplexers. For even greater speed, arithmetic operations are based on a redundant number representation. Algorithms for single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD), mesh architectures can be easily adapted for the micrograined processor. This is particularly true for algorithms for certain two-dimensional signal and image processing problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5898/00226514.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"644 vol.5","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A micro-grained VLSI signal processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Signal processing","Registers","Multiplexing","Parallel processing","Signal processing algorithms","Image processing","Process design","Computer science","Read-write memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","parallel architectures","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D signal processing","micro-grained VLSI signal processor","fine grainness","fine grain processors","processor complexity","RAM","multiplexers","arithmetic operations","redundant number representation","single-instruction multiple-data","mesh architectures","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A micro-grained VLSI signal processor","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4463447","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A micro-grained VLSI signal processor","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0561S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"22","articleId":"226514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226522,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

The interference is viewed as a stochastic process n(m,t) in two variables (m representing the sensor, and t the time); if t is fixed the corresponding process is stationary but if m is fixed it is nonstationary. A uniform linear array is assumed, and it is also assumed that the carrier frequency is known and that the direction of arrival (DOA) of the desired signal does not change. The detection problem is discussed for a known DOA, and it is shown that it is a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector. The approach taken here is an application/extension of the multiwindow method for spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis introduced by D.J. Thomson (1982). How the signal is estimated if present and how to estimate the DOA are briefly discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226522","startPage":"253","endPage":"256 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5898/00226522.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and estimation of an unknown narrow-band signal in severely nonstationary noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Interference","Sensor arrays","Direction of arrival estimation","Stochastic processes","Detectors","Frequency","Signal processing","Working environment noise","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference (signal)","parameter estimation","random noise","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOA estimation","array processing","signal detection","signal estimation","CFAR detector","severely nonstationary noise","unknown narrowband signal","interference","stochastic process","uniform linear array","direction of arrival","constant false alarm rate","multiwindow method","spectrum estimation","harmonic analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation of an unknown narrow-band signal in severely nonstationary noise","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","accessionNumber":"4463439","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation of an unknown narrow-band signal in severely nonstationary noise","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042097S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"2","articleId":"226522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":226530,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Different nonlinearities applied to the complex envelope of the signal under classification are used to exploit differences in the higher-order moment spaces of the time-discrete modulating process. These differences manifest themselves in lines in the spectrum of the transformed signal, associated with the unknown carrier frequency and baud rate. The lines are detected by the periodogram analysis. Their existence, position and amplitude constitute a robust feature for separating 2ASK, 2PSK, 4PSK, MSK and 2FSK.

This cost quantifies the leakage from one frequency to another. The choice of the penalty function appearing in the cost expression may be adapted to a given spectral analysis problem: the designer controls undesirable leakages. The approach is applied to a particular optimization problem: extending the minimization of the second order moment to the case of sampled signals spectra. This example leads to a correct justification of Papoulis' (1972) minimum energy moment window in the case of digital signals. Applications show an example of window design and the interest of Papoulis window in some problems of spectral parameters estimation: Pisarenko frequency estimation and autoregressive modelization.

In particular, the method can be applied to multicomponent signals, since it reduces considerably the effect of the cross terms, produced by the WVD, on the signal parameters estimate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/626/5898/00226630.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"176 vol.5","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] ICASSP-92: 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined Wigner-Ville and Hough transform for cross-terms suppression and optimal detection and parameter estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Signal mapping","Shape","Signal detection","Pattern recognition","Matched filters","Radar detection","Chirp modulation","Time frequency analysis","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","matched filters","parameter estimation","signal detection","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signals mapping","cross terms suppression","optimal detection","parameter estimation","Wigner-Ville distribution","WVD","Hough transform","parameter space","noise","matched filter theory","multicomponent signals","signal parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"A combined Wigner-Ville and Hough transform for cross-terms suppression and optimal detection and parameter estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4459713","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined Wigner-Ville and Hough transform for cross-terms suppression and optimal detection and parameter estimation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00226630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02279S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"626","citationCount":"34","articleId":"226630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":226632,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The decomposition is organized using a matrix framework, from which in-place and constant geometry schedules can be generated. Iteration of the trellis corresponds to iteration of the subtrellis within each column of a state metric matrix. This leads to the classification of architectures as column sequential or column concurrent, depending on the assignment of add-compare-select processors to columns.

A set of parameters is extracted from the spectrum of the EMG signals combining with the subband coding technique for data compression. Each sequence of EMG signals is cut into five frames from the primary point located by the energy threshold method. From each frame, the parameters are then obtained by the integration of the subbands. The temporal as well as the spectral characteristics can be implicitly or directly included in the parameters.

The Rummler channel model is used for modeling the digital microwave radio channel. In applying neural networks to the channel equalization problem, complex neurons in the neural network are used. This allows for a frequency interpretation of the weights of the neurons in the first hidden layer. This channel model allows examination of binary signaling in two dimensions, (4-quadrature amplitude modulation, or QAM), and higher-level signaling as well, (16-QAM). Results show that while neural nets provide a significant performance increase in the case of binary signaling in two dimensions (4-QAM), this performance is not reflected in the results for the higher-level signaling schemes. In this case the neural net equalizer performance tends to parallel that of the linear transversal equalizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226870","startPage":"919","endPage":"924 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5900","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5900/00226870.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of feed forward neural networks to channel equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226870/","displayDocTitle":"On the application of feed forward neural networks to channel equalization","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4432339","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of feed forward neural networks to channel equalization","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041963S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"3","articleId":"226870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":226871,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Since self-organizing maps tend to contract at region boundaries, a procedure for locking neuron weights at specific locations in a region is presented. A strategy for preferentially training neuron weights on the region boundaries is introduced. As an example of these training techniques, a one-dimensional neural network will approximate a nonlinear function. In general an n-dimension mapping can be used to approximate an m-dimensional system for n<or=m. As a practical implementation of this technique, the modeling of the theoretical torque of a SRM as a function of position and current is presented.

Methods using higher-order information, e.g., DDEKF are very effective in comparison to methods based exclusively upon gradient descent, e.g., dynamic backpropagation (DBP). The use of a recurrent structure for obtaining derivatives for controller training is illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226889","startPage":"798","endPage":"804 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5900","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5900/00226889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural control systems trained by dynamic gradient methods for automotive applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226889/","displayDocTitle":"Neural control systems trained by dynamic gradient methods for automotive applications","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4422035","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural control systems trained by dynamic gradient methods for automotive applications","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0296S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"15","articleId":"226889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":226890,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A multi-layered neural network is first trained to model the input-output mapping of a controlled object of an unknown, discrete-time nonlinear system. This neuro emulator is used for generating Jacobian information with respect to the controlled object. The Jacobian coefficients were generated by the multi-layered neural network which had been, in advance, trained to map the input-output relation of the controlled object. The potential method was then applied for generating the input sequences under constructing an asymptotically stable gradient system. The tracking property was assured in the sense of linearization approximation of the controlled object. A simple control law is determined by Lyapunov's method so that the output of the controlled object can follow a reference input.

Stability is related to the optimum sigmoid function shape. An autotuning method for the optimum sigmoid function is proposed. The automating method is applied to a learning type direct controller in order to confirm its characteristics. The neural network of this controller has three layers with no inner feedback loop and no direct connection from the input layer to the output layer. Both the input and the hidden layers have four neurons and the output layer has one neuron. Both the hidden and output layers have a sigmoid function to provide the nonlinear mapping capability. The autotuning method uses the steepest descent method in order to apply it to servo control systems.

The system consists of four subsystems: sensors performing as hardware sensing devices, knowledge database of sensors (KBS), fuzzy inference, and a neural network (NN). The sensor's measurement value includes a measurement error. This system estimates the measurement error of each sensor using fuzzy inference. Fuzzy rules are developed from the KBS.

The simulation results indicate the feasibility of the BNN-based approach. It is demonstrated that a forward-chaining fuzzy reasoning system with parallel rule-bases can be implemented within the framework of neural networks.

A digital signal processor or a host computer can be used for updating of synapse weights during the learning phase. The analog computing blocks consist of a synapse matrix and the input and output neuron arrays. The output neuron is composed of a current-to-voltage converter and a sigmoid function generator with a controllable voltage gain. An improved Gilbert multiplier is used for the synapse design. The input and output neurons are tailored to reduce the network settling time and minimize the silicon area that is used for implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5900/00226916.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"641 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5900","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI design of compact and high-precision analog neural network processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Analog computers","Design engineering","Application software","Pattern recognition","Image coding","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","neural chips","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog VLSI","backpropagation","analog neural network","feedforward computation","synapse matrix","neuron arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"VLSI design of compact and high-precision analog neural network processors","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4422008","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI design of compact and high-precision analog neural network processors","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029499S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"11","articleId":"226916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":226918,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The use of simple logic gates for neural operations and the modular design techniques lead to a compact, expandable architecture of the DMNN suitable for VLSI implementation. A DMNN architecture for recognizing characters is presented and its performance is evaluated. The architecture and all digital sub-components in the DMNN are modeled and simulated in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The modular design technique is extremely efficient, especially in building multilayered neural networks, since they can be simply constructed by connecting any desired number of modules. Full parallelism is utilized in the DMNN architecture. Its processing speed depends only on the clock frequency and register lengths, not on the network size. About 200000 patterns per second are classified for a 9-bit register length and 50-MHz clock. The classification performance of the DMNN five-digit recognizer is shown to be competitive in terms of classification rates when the register length is greater than eight.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226923/","accessionNumber":"4422001","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An implementable digital multilayer neural network (DMNN)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An implementable digital multilayer neural network (DMNN)","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055934S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"226923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":226924,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Adaptive feedforward artificial neural networks (AF-ANNs) are used for supervising, and in-process regressions for monitoring machining operations. The supervision of machining operations is studied within the framework of multiple criteria decision making. The decision maker (operator) considers several criteria, such as cutting quality, production rate, and tool life. To make the optimal decision with several criteria, the decision maker's preferences have to be elicited and assessed.

In order to find patterns similar to a specified pattern in the database, two problems must be solved. One is a nonlinear time elasticity for the patterns. This nonlinearity is normalized by DP-matching. The second is a bias which was generated by differences in names and time span. This bias is eliminated by a stock price normalization method and a neural network. A stock price pattern matching system using the DNN approach was developed on an NEC EWS4800 workstation. This system has a graphical user interface on an X-Window system. A subjective evaluation was conducted. The stock price patterns which were classified by DNN were evaluated by three chartists (human experts). High correlation was found between the similarity by DNN and the evaluation by chartists. The proposed DNN system is able to match patterns, which chartists judge as similar patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226944/","accessionNumber":"4421980","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stock price pattern matching system-dynamic programming neural networks approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stock price pattern matching system-dynamic programming neural networks approach","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036711S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"10","articleId":"226944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":226945,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The authors present a neural network architecture for load forecasting which is capable of capturing the relevant relationships and weather trends. The proposed architecture is tested by training three neural networks, which in turn are tested with weather data form the same four-day period. The network is made up of a series of subnetworks each connected to its immediate neighbors in a way that takes into consideration not only current weather conditions but also the weather trend around the hour for which the forecast is being made. The neural network forecasts were very close to the actual values despite the facts that only a small sample was used and there were errors in the data. A more comprehensive study is being contemplated for the next phase. One of the issues to be addressed is the expansion of the scope of the research to include data from a complete season (three consecutive months) over several years.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226948/","accessionNumber":"4421976","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network architecture for load forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network architecture for load forecasting","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041527S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"8","articleId":"226948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":226952,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This network combines advantages of hypersphere classifiers, such as the restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) network, radial basis function methods, and BPNN. It provides the ability to initialize nodes to serve either as hyperplane separators or as spherical prototypes (radial basis functions), followed by a modified gradient descent error minimization training of the network weights and thresholds, which adjusts the prototype positions and sizes and may convert closed prototype decision boundaries to open boundaries, and vice versa.

Using a stochastic model for input and weight errors, simple analytical expressions for the output error variance of feedforward neural networks composed of sigmoidal, threshold or linear units are derived.

The algorithm for training the templates is derived based on minimizing classification error of the speech classifier. A speaker-independent isolated digit recognition experiment is conducted and achieves a 0.89% average recognition error rate with only one template for each digit, indicating that the derived templates are able to capture the speaker-invariant features of speech signals. Both nondiscriminative and discriminative versions of the neural net template training algorithm are considered. The former is based on maximum likelihood estimation. The latter is based on minimizing classification error. It is demonstrated through experiments that the discriminative training algorithm is far superior to the nondiscriminative one, providing both smaller recognition error rate and greater discrimination power. Experiments using different feature representation schemes are considered. It is demonstrated that the combination of the feature vector and the delta feature vector yields the best recognition result.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226967/","accessionNumber":"4421957","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech recognition using dynamic time warping with neural network trained templates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech recognition using dynamic time warping with neural network trained templates","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043202S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"226967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":226972,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

One network is a temporally constrained self-organizing feature map. The other network is a time-delay network which has been modified by the addition of recurrent connections. These networks were tested as secondary processors to a conventional (non-neural network) wordspotter. In this scenario, the conventional system screened incoming speech for potential keywords which are passed to the networks for the final accept/reject determination. The database used for testing contains 20 key words. The test results are summarized in receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. These initial results indicate that wordspotting performance is helped by the application of neural network word discriminators as secondary processors. The percentage of keywords recognized was improved at all false alarm rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226972/","accessionNumber":"4421952","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network word/false-alarm discriminators for improved keyword spotting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network word/false-alarm discriminators for improved keyword spotting","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027733S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"2","articleId":"226972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":226973,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The system is an integrated approach of neuromorphic and symbolic control of a robotic manipulator, including an applied neural network for the servo control, a knowledge-based approximation, and a fuzzy neural network (FNN) for skill-based control. The neural network in the servo control level is the numerical manipulation, while the knowledge-based part is the symbolic manipulation. In neuromorphic control, the neural network compensates for the nonlinearity of the system and the uncertainty in the environment. The knowledge-based part develops the control strategy symbolically for the servo level. The FNN is used between the servo control level and the knowledge-based part to link numerals to symbols and express human skills through learning.

The author reports one approach to the use of feedforward networks to dampen chaotic oscillations in Duffing's oscillator. A catastrophic failure of the neural network controller is also studied. For networks with a single hidden layer, a point of diminishing returns was encountered as the size of the hidden layer increased. Suppression improves slightly as the hidden layer size increases. The larger networks take longer to train and are less responsive to changes in oscillator dynamics; however the larger networks recover faster after a transient disturbance in the oscillator dynamics. The majority of the tests were conducted on a network with a single hidden layer of 50 elements. The addition of more hidden layers provided only marginal improvements in suppression at the expense of much longer training times.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226981","startPage":"75","endPage":"80 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5900/00226981.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling chaos with a neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Neural networks","Oscillators","Acceleration","Control systems","Control system synthesis","Feeds","Magnetic levitation","Concatenated codes","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","damping","feedforward neural nets","large-scale systems","oscillations","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward networks","chaotic oscillations","Duffing's oscillator","neural network controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Controlling chaos with a neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4421943","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling chaos with a neural network","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047999S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"10","articleId":"226981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":226992,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These are readily programmable and refreshable. A pitch-matched interconnection and a combinational unit circuit used for summing product provide a tight layout by eliminating bus lines between the memory cell array and the product-summation circuit. A dynamic data transfer circuit directly coupled to the DRAM cell array, together with 1.5-V operation of the entire chip, reduces the power dissipation to 75 mW. The 256 parallel circuits for summing product provide a processing speed of 1.37 gigaconnections/s.

The system is far more robust to acoustic noise and verbal distractors than is a system not incorporating visual information. Specifically, in the presence of high-amplitude pink noise, the low recognition rate in the acoustic only system (43%) is raised to 75% by the incorporation of visual information. The system responds to (artificial) conflicting cross-modal patterns in a way closely analogous to the McGurk effect in humans. The power of neural techniques is demonstrated in several difficult domains: pattern recognition; sensory integration; and distributed approaches toward 'rule-based' (linguistic-phonological) processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5900/00226994.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"295 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network lipreading system for improved speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226994","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=226994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural network lipreading system for improved speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4417494","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network lipreading system for improved speech recognition","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064055S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"55","articleId":"226994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":226996,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

One difficulty of this approach is the selection of an energy function, particularly for the problems with constraints.

A novel approach to the derivation of a neural network is introduced. This approach can always obtain valid solutions for problems with linear equality constraints. Instead of using penalty, a projection factor is incorporated in the neural network synthesis so that the convergence trace will stay in the constraint plan, and thus always return a valid solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226996","startPage":"272","endPage":"277 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.226996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5900","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5900/00226996.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network for solving optimization problems with linear equality constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/226996/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network for solving optimization problems with linear equality constraints","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4417492","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network for solving optimization problems with linear equality constraints","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00226996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029351S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"6","articleId":"226996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":226997,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

The key to the technique is to decompose the arbitrary mapping into a sequence of operations composed of three primitive operations. As each of the primitive operations is easily realizable in a simple layered feedforward net, the mapping can be realized by cascading the simple feedforward nets corresponding to the decomposition. The time spent in the construction of the net is proportional to k*n/sup 2/, compared to k*2/sup n/ typical of the conventional direct approaches. With such a reduction, the technique can be used in building multilayer feedforward nets for binary association problems of extremely large size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227009/","accessionNumber":"4417479","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient algorithm for the design of multilayer feedforward neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient algorithm for the design of multilayer feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033643S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"227009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":227042,"authors":[{"name":"Yuen-Hsien Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuen-Hsien Tseng","id":"37382699000"},{"name":"Ja-Ling Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ja-Ling Wu","id":"37279164700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0559-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"227042","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error correction codes","Multilayer perceptrons","Polynomials","Computer science","Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Backpropagation","Costs","Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","neural nets","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","decoding","error-correcting codes","Hamming code","high-order polynomials","two-layer networks","high-order perceptrons","linear perceptrons"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227042","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5901/00227042.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"29 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=227042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-order perceptrons for decoding error-correcting codes","abstract":"The authors prove that the single-error correcting (2/sup n/-1, 2/sup n/-1-n) Hamming code and its extended single-error correcting/double-error detecting (2/sup n/, 2/sup n/-1-n) code can be decoded by low-complexity single-layer perceptrons which use high-order polynomials as their discriminant functions.

The most important characteristics of the model are the simplicity of the modules, the replicability of the training results, easy adaptation to topological changes, and high scalability. It allows for parallel implementation.

They focus on the generalization ability and storage capacity, which are both independent of the particular training algorithm used. The questions considered are: (1) given a net and a certain amount of training data which are samples of a function that the net can represent, how accurately will the net classify unseen data which are samples of the same function? and (2) given a net and a certain amount of training data which are samples of a random function, what is the probability of error-free storage? The first question is answered by using a simple model of the generalization process that gives an expression for the generalization error as a function of the network connectivities and number of training examples. This is compared with computer simulations of some small two-layer networks used to learn a particular function. The second question is addressed by giving an upper bound on the statistical storage capacity.

Simulations reported that the learning speed and computational time of PTNNs were superior to those of the standard neural networks for a complicated continuous function and the two-spiral problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227052","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5901/00227052.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"816 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partially trained neural networks based on partition of unity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Partially trained neural networks based on partition of unity","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4426952","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partially trained neural networks based on partition of unity","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041718S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"2","articleId":"227052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":227059,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is a hybrid model because it consists of both unsupervised and supervised learning. The unsupervised layer plays the feature extracting role, and the supervised layer is responsible for class decision. When learning is completed, the user presents a seismic pattern to this model to obtain a decision on to which class the input pattern belongs. If the model fails to recognize a pattern, that means there are no nodes located in the output layer that produce a large enough response. Then, the model will automatically decrease its vigilance threshold to become more tolerant. This automatic-tolerance-adjusted mechanism is demonstrated on some examples, such as recognizing patterns in translation, scaling, noise, or deformation. The concepts are based on competitive learning from Kohonen, self-organization learning from Fukushima, and the delta rule.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227064","startPage":"736","endPage":"741 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5901","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5901/00227064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid neural network for seismic pattern recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227064/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid neural network for seismic pattern recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4426940","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid neural network for seismic pattern recognition","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037915S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"2","articleId":"227064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":227068,"authors":[{"name":"N.Z.

The extended BP is intended not only to improve the learning speed, but also to reduce the occurrence of local minima. The algorithm has been intensively tested on the XOR problem.

At least one example of a GenNet is presented for each of three cases of time-dependent/independent inputs/outputs, and it is shown how GP techniques were used to evolve GenNets whose operating conditions satisfied the three cases. Some of the extraordinary properties of time-independent GenNets are discussed. The sophisticated behaviors generated by GenNets and recurrent backdrop algorithms are compared.

A multiscale array of oriented filters, followed by competition between orientations and scales, is used to define the where filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227157","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5901/00227157.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"308 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A what-and-where neural network for invariant image preprocessing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"A what-and-where neural network for invariant image preprocessing","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4422087","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A what-and-where neural network for invariant image preprocessing","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038112S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"7","articleId":"227157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227160,"authors":[{"name":"N.

There exists a smooth relationship between the degree of blur and the distance of a problem from a test pad on a VLSI chip. Therefore, by measuring the amount of blurring, the distance from contact can be estimated. The effect of blurring on a point-object is studied in the frequency domain, and a monolithic relationship is found between the degree of blur and the frequency content of the image. Fourier feature extraction, with its inherent property of shift-invariance, was utilized to extract significant feature vectors. These vectors contain information on the degree of blur, and hence the distance from the probe. Neural networks were employed to map these feature vectors onto the actual distances. The network was then used in the recall mode to linearly interpolate the distance corresponding to the significant Fourier features of a blurred image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227160","startPage":"286","endPage":"290 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5901","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5901/00227160.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth perception from blurring-a neural networks based approach for automated visual inspection in VLSI wafer probing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227160/","displayDocTitle":"Depth perception from blurring-a neural networks based approach for automated visual inspection in VLSI wafer probing","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4422084","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth perception from blurring-a neural networks based approach for automated visual inspection in VLSI wafer probing","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041156S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"227160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227165,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The issue in the character recognition system is to provide this accuracy at a speed compatible with commercial requirements of 1 page/s.

The optimal segmentation is found by representing the image, the candidate segments, and their scores as a graph in which the shortest path corresponds to the optimal interpretation. The scores are given by neural net outputs for each segment. A significant advantage of the method is that the labor required to segment images manually is eliminated. The system was trained on approximately 7000 unsegmented handwritten zip codes provided by the United States Postal Service. The system has achieved a per-zip-code raw recognition rate of 81% on a 2368 handwritten zip-code test set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227175","startPage":"165","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5901/00227175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227175","endPage":"172 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shortest path segmentation: a method for training a neural network to recognize character strings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Shortest path segmentation: a method for training a neural network to recognize character strings","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4422069","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shortest path segmentation: a method for training a neural network to recognize character strings","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098937S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"18","articleId":"227175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227176,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Results are shown to demonstrate the viability of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4427022","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving temporal representation in TDNN structure for phoneme recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving temporal representation in TDNN structure for phoneme recognition","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054704S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"227232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227233,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To make such a system more robust, the development of a neural network based noise reduction module is described. Using standard feedforward networks, several topologies have been tested to learn about the properties of neural noise reduction. For the development of a sufficiently robust nonadaptive system, information about the characteristics of the noise and speech components of the input signal including context information was taken into account. The focus is on the stepwise experiment-oriented improvement of a basic linear neural noise reduction network. The isolated word recognition system and the database used for the experiments are described. Results from different noise reduction networks are given. To test their robustness, simulations with varying input signal characteristics were made and are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4427021","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network development for noise reduction in robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network development for noise reduction in robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033438S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"7","articleId":"227233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":227234,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

It is shown that the Hopfield net can be rocked to produce a combinatorially minimal solution and that the error backpropagation can be rocked to produce a globally optimal multilayer perceptron.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227253/","accessionNumber":"4427001","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to global optimization and its applications to neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to global optimization and its applications to neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034174S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"227253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227257,"authors":[{"name":"B.L.

Attention should focus on choosing an activation function in a neural unit that exhibits the best properties for training. The author argues for the use of the hyperbolic tangent. While the exact shape of the sigmoidal makes little difference once the network is trained, it is shown that it possesses particular properties that make it appealing for use while training. By paying attention to scaling it is illustrated that tanh (1.5*) has the additional advantage of equalizing training over layers. This result can easily generalize to several standard sigmoidal functions commonly in use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5902/00227257.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"581 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=227257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Why tanh: choosing a sigmoidal function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Intelligent systems","Computer science","Shape","Feedforward systems","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Logistics","Hardware","Telephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tanh","sigmoidal function","backpropagation","training algorithms","activation function","hyperbolic tangent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Why tanh: choosing a sigmoidal function","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4426997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Why tanh: choosing a sigmoidal function","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020162S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"50","articleId":"227257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":227258,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This direct linear feedthrough (DLF) network is an especially useful tool for modeling process data when the true linear or nonlinear functionality of the system is not known. By just looking at the linear and nonlinear contributions of this DLF network, it is possible to tell if the data are purely linear or nonlinear. For the learning algorithm, sequential quadratic programming improves the training time of the neural network by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to that of the back-propagation method. The authors also suggest that when the number of data samples is small compared to the size of the network, the risk of under-representing or overfitting the available data can be avoided by using the leave-one-out cross validation technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227262","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5902/00227262.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"554 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regression analysis of spectroscopic process data using a combined architecture of linear and nonlinear artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Regression analysis of spectroscopic process data using a combined architecture of linear and nonlinear artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4426992","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression analysis of spectroscopic process data using a combined architecture of linear and nonlinear artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022695S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"227262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227264,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A stability criterion for the learning neural network is established and is a function of the learning rate, a sigmoid function and the upper bound of the interconnection strength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227271","startPage":"171","endPage":"176 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5902/00227271.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of learning recurrent neural networks: connective stability and equilibrium manifold","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Stability analysis","Neural networks","Manifolds","Lyapunov method","Stability criteria","Matrix decomposition","Symmetric matrices","Intelligent control","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","connective stability","recurrent neural networks","learning rule","equilibrium manifold","stability criterion","learning rate","sigmoid function","interconnection strength"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of learning recurrent neural networks: connective stability and equilibrium manifold","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","accessionNumber":"4426983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of learning recurrent neural networks: connective stability and equilibrium manifold","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039223S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"1","articleId":"227271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227272,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The results are especially suitable for asymmetric neural networks. A constraint on the connection matrix has been founded under which the neural network has a unique and exponentially stable equilibrium.

A one-to-one and smooth map between input currents and the equilibria of the neural network can be set up. The uniqueness results can be applied to analyze the master/slave net.

They use a new logic circuit called neural logic gate (NLG) to provide two logic functions, and obtain a preliminary set of test patterns. A circuit of the NLG is defined as intersecting sets of neurons with the k-out-of-n design rule, and has neither analog parameters nor stochastic operations. A problem is presented for test pattern generation using NLG to be solved by the SDNN system. The simulation results of automatic test pattern generation for a n-bit full-adder circuit up to 128 bit show that the order of computation is approximately O(n/sup 1.4/) in parallel convergence, and O(n/sup 2.4/) in sequential simulation. Compared with the original neural network, SDNN was able to find a set of test patterns more readily than the original neural network in large scale problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227299/","accessionNumber":"4422223","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An approach to automatic test pattern generation using strictly digital neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to automatic test pattern generation using strictly digital neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028851S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"3","articleId":"227299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":227301,"authors":[{"name":"A.

More than 97% clutter rejection is achieved without losing the target information.

Both the neural network algorithm and the subspace inhibition filter algorithm provide enhanced local resolution of the arrival times and frequencies of the components of a transient signal. Both algorithms allow for detection of signal components in the subregions in the presence of interference from neighboring regions. Both algorithms allow for this detection without the restriction that signals be centered on the Gabor lattice. For comparison, a binary classification example has been constructed in which there is no prior knowledge that one transient signal in noise is present in the subregion. Probability of false alarm and probability of detection are computed for a series of test signals presented to both detectors. It is shown that the neural network is comparable in performance to the subspace inhibition filter algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227328","startPage":"283","endPage":"288 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5902","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5902/00227328.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resolving the components of transient signals using neural network and subspace inhibition filter algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227328/","displayDocTitle":"Resolving the components of transient signals using neural network and subspace inhibition filter algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"4422194","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resolving the components of transient signals using neural network and subspace inhibition filter algorithms","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03014S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"3","articleId":"227328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227331,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

Because the transfer functions of the middle nodes are the terms of the Fourier series, the synaptic link values between the middle and output layers represent the frequency spectrum of the signals of the output nodes. As a result of auto-associatively training the network with all the middle nodes and testing it with certain selected ones, it is quite easy to build a nonlinear bandpass filter. A rapid learning algorithm is introduced that reduces the training time.

The feature point distribution of a standard pattern is mapped onto that of a distorted pattern, through a modified self-organizing map (SOM). The distorted pattern is recognized based on similarity between both feature point distributions. The modified SOM has the following advantages. First, the number of feature points is small, and these are classified into several groups. Second, the mapping is carried out in the variable ring shape region to find a suitable pairing of the feature points. Third, the feature points are selected from both the standard and the distorted patterns to avoid any vibration. Finally, neighborhoods are selected along lines of the patterns.

The first layer constitutes a stem network which quantizes an input feature vector space into several subspaces and the following 2-4 layers constitute branch network modules which classify input data in each sub-space into specified categories. CombNET-II uses a self-growing neural network learning procedure, for training the stem network. Back propagation is utilized to train branch networks. Each branch module, which is a three-layer hierarchical network, has a restricted number of output neurons and inter-connections so that it is easy to train. Therefore CombNET-II does not cause the local minimum state since the complexities of the problems to be solved for each branch module are restricted by the stem network.

The authors explain why this happens and identify a number of characteristics that the optimal objective function for training classifiers must have. They show that classification figures of merit (CFM/sub mono/) possess these optimal characteristics, whereas error measures such as MSE and CE do not. The arguments are illustrated with a simple example in which a CFM/sub mono/-trained low-order polynomial neural network approximates Bayesian discrimination on a random scalar with the fewest number of training samples and the minimum functional complexity necessary for the task. A comparable MSE-trained net yields significantly worse discrimination on the same task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227338","startPage":"220","endPage":"227 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5902","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/632/5902/00227338.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Why error measures are sub-optimal for training neural network pattern classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227338/","displayDocTitle":"Why error measures are sub-optimal for training neural network pattern classifiers","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"4422184","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Why error measures are sub-optimal for training neural network pattern classifiers","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00227338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031921S","chronDate":"7-11 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"632","citationCount":"3","articleId":"227338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":227344,"authors":[{"name":"J.-N.

When later presented with distorted object without point correspondence, this parametric representation reduces the effects caused by detection/occlusion and also allows the mismatch information back-propagated through the SRNN to iteratively determine the best similarity transform of the distorted object.

The method provides the invariant representation of the image in each fixation point and of spatial relations of features extracted in neighboring fixation points.

The savings in the number of multiplications occur if some restrictions are placed on the modular ring used for performing the complex residue number system operations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Signal processing","Digital signal processing","Convolution","Signal processing algorithms","Autocorrelation","Performance evaluation","Digital arithmetic","Concurrent computing","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial residue number system","quadratic residue number system","complex digital signal processing","N-point complex linear convolution","PRNS","modular ring"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.227375","startPage":"342","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5903/00227375.pdf","doi":"10.1109/82.227375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial residue complex signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial residue complex signal processing","accessionNumber":"4517181","publicationDate":"May 1993","volume":"40","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial residue complex signal processing","sourcePdf":"00227375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04115S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"13","articleId":"227375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":227382,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An important tuning parameter of this method is the striping unit that is, the maximum number of logically consecutive blocks that are allocated on one disk. The striping unit determines the degree of parallelism in servicing a request by multiple disks, and its affects the achievable throughput of I/O requests. Since a good choice of a file's striping unit depends on the file's access characteristics such as average request size, it is proposed that file-specific striping units be chosen rather than choosing the same global striping unit for all files. The paper presents a method for tuning file-specific striping units, based on the access characteristics of the individual files and the throughput requirements of the application. Performance experiments are presented, based on a synthetic benchmark that was run on the file system prototype FIVE and a simulation testbed for disk-arrays.

Often the scheduling algorithms used are those that were intended for homogeneous systems. On the other hand, most scheduling algorithms designed with heterogeneity in mind were developed under unrealistic assumptions. To enhance the performance of a multicomputer system, load sharing can be used during scheduling to distribute the workload evenly among the constituent nodes. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of load sharing algorithms in heterogeneous multicomputer systems. The simulation results suggest that load sharing policies that perform well in homogeneous systems fail to achieve good performance in heterogeneous systems. The authors also show that the distribution of service time and the communication overhead have significant impact on system performance. They conclude by providing guidelines for selecting load sharing policies suitable for different heterogeneous environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of load sharing in heterogeneous multicomputer systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 25th Annual Simulation Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SIMSYM.1992.227580","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 25th Annual Simulation Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/406/5907/00227580.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIMSYM.1992.227580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5907","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=227580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of load sharing in heterogeneous multicomputer systems","conferenceDate":"6-9 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4412067","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of load sharing in heterogeneous multicomputer systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00227580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05005S","chronDate":"6-9 Apr 1992","isNumber":"5907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"406","citationCount":"16","articleId":"227580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":227583,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

Results obtained on a number of benchmark examples are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/411/5909/00227774.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"386","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1992.227774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1992.227774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=227774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved synthesis algorithm for multiplexor-based PGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronics packaging","Boolean functions","Data structures","Tree graphs","Circuit synthesis","Logic arrays","Libraries","Combinational circuits","Equations","Network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial circuits","directed graphs","logic arrays","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthesis algorithm","multiplexor-based PGAs","combinational circuit","if-then-else","directed acyclic graphs","binary decision diagrams","benchmark examples"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"An improved synthesis algorithm for multiplexor-based PGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4407778","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved synthesis algorithm for multiplexor-based PGAs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00227774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024769S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"411","citationCount":"30","articleId":"227774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227776,"authors":[{"name":"P.

TEMPT is as effective as the Xilinx 4000 CLB mapper, PPR, when minimizing CLBs to implement a set of MCNC benchmarks. Using TEMPT it was shown empirically that many HLBs were significantly faster than FPGAs without hard-wired links.

Examples of the design of a 64-b comparator and of a 64-b ripple-carry adder are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1992.227813","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/411/5909/00227813.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1992.227813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-valued binary decision for multi-level hierarchical verification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=227813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227813/","displayDocTitle":"Edge-valued binary decision for multi-level hierarchical verification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399566","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-valued binary decision for multi-level hierarchical verification","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00227813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038863S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"411","citationCount":"51","articleId":"227813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":227826,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Switching activity is strongly affected by gate delays and for this reason a general delay model is used in estimating switching activity. The method takes into account correlation caused at internal gates in the circuit due to reconvergence of input signals. In sequential circuits, the input sequence applied to the combinational portion of the circuit is highly correlated because some of the inputs to the combinational logic are flip-flop outputs representing the state of the circuit. Methods are presented to probabilistically estimate switching activity in sequential circuits.

The main contribution of the analysis highlights advantages to using the dual representation of the logic design, and confirming that net structure and interrelationships, rather than module adjacencies, should constitute the primary descriptors of a circuit. In particular, the dual intersection graph representation of the netlist hypergraph yields much more natural circuit partitioning formulations, since it inherently emphasizes relationships between signal nets. The intersection graph yields a sparser circuit representation than traditional net models. An efficient algorithm, called IG-Match, is proposed for completing the net partition. The IG-Match method yielded significant performance improvements over previous ratio-cut partitioning methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1992.227863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5909","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 29th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/411/5909/00227863.pdf","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Net partitions yield better module partitions","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1992.227863","startPage":"47","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=227863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Net partitions yield better module partitions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/227863/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4395317","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"8-12 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Net partitions yield better module partitions","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00227863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031995S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"411","citationCount":"27","articleId":"227863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":227864,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.

Under such performance constraint, the objective is to design this circuit as cheap as possible. Autocorrelation method is adopted for computing the coefficients because of its stability of the results and regular computations. A two-step pipelined functional unit is designed for calculating those regular computations. For the divisions needed in autocorrelation method, the prune-and-search approach is used to compute them. Because this approach can also be performed by the identical pipelined functional unit, the extra operator for the divisions is not required. Although the authors have designed this chip with least storage element and functional unit, however, the performance is still much faster than the real-time request.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Euro ASIC '92","pdfPath":"/iel2/416/5911/00228038.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"291","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Euro ASIC '92","doi":"10.1109/EUASIC.1992.228038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUASIC.1992.228038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=228038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ASIC design for linear predictive coding of speech signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Signal design","Linear predictive coding","Speech coding","Autocorrelation","Speech recognition","Hardware","Feature extraction","Sampling methods","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","feature extraction","linear predictive coding","microprocessor chips","pipeline processing","real-time systems","speech analysis and processing","speech recognition equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC design","linear predictive coding","speech signals","real-time speech recognition","predictor coefficients","recognizing features","performance constraint","two-step pipelined functional unit","regular computations","autocorrelation method","prune-and-search approach","identical pipelined functional unit","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/228038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"An ASIC design for linear predictive coding of speech signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4412190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ASIC design for linear predictive coding of speech signals","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00228038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039246S","chronDate":"1-5 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"416","citationCount":"2","articleId":"228038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":228044,"authors":[{"name":"Moon Key Lee","affiliation":["Research Institute of ASIC Design, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moon Key Lee","id":"37087257515"},{"name":"Byeong Yoon Choi","affiliation":["Research Institute of ASIC Design, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byeong Yoon Choi","id":"37087906841"},{"name":"Seoung Ho Lee","affiliation":["Research Institute of ASIC Design, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seoung Ho Lee","id":"37088171485"},{"name":"Kwang Yup Lee","affiliation":["Research Institute of ASIC Design, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang Yup Lee","id":"37087850974"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-2845-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"228044","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Reduced instruction set computing","Central Processing Unit","Very large scale integration","CMOS technology","Computer aided instruction","Testing","Pipelines","Clocks","Sparks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","microprocessor chips","pipeline processing","reduced instruction set computing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two phase clock","circuit layout","ASIC design","high performance RISC","VLSI implementation","reduced instruction set computer","testing methodology","functional fault model","4-stage instruction execution pipeline","single cycle execution","cell-based approach","SPARK RISC CPU","scalar performance","double layer metal CMOS technology","16.7 MHz","16.7 MIPS","1 micron","32 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=228044","doi":"10.1109/EUASIC.1992.228044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUASIC.1992.228044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5911","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Euro ASIC '92","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Euro ASIC '92","pdfPath":"/iel2/416/5911/00228044.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC design of a high performance RISC","abstract":"Describes the VLSI implementation of a 32-bit central processing unit (CPU) chip based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles and its testing methodology based on functional fault model.

These properties can be exploited by producing a family of new flexure actuators which can produce very significant motion via thermal expansion and magnetic forces. The magnitude of thermal effects and magnetic forces are dependent on actuator geometry. An understanding of each effect allows the design of an actuator which is dominated by one or both effects. The end result is devices intended for large motion actuators in microswitch and positioning applications.

A voltage source inverter, connected in series with the AC supply through a transformer, is used to compensate the input voltage variations in order to achieve a regulated load voltage. Input power factor improvement can also be obtained, when operating with reactive load, by phase-shifting the compensating voltage with respect to the input voltage. The total kVA rating for the system is a fraction of the load total power, and is determined by the maximum allowable line voltage variation. The use of a series connection together with a high-performance modulation technique results in a fast dynamic response and a small-size filter. A high-quality output is readily achieved. The authors describe the proposed method, implementation principles, design equations, and a design example.

The equivalent circuit produces a voltage-coded signal which is proportional to the effective duty cycle (D/sub ON/) of the regulator. The proposed approach converts the switching circuitry of the magamp post regulator to a SPICE-compatible equivalent circuit by replacing the SR and the switched inductor with their respective equivalent-circuit models. The resulting equivalent circuit of the system can then be used to simulate the large and small signal behavior of the regulator under static and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach was verified by comparing simulation results to previously reported analytical and experimental data. The two sets of independent results were found to be in excellent agreement. The authors demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to simplify the analysis and design of practical magamp post regulators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SPICE","Regulators","Equivalent circuits","Circuit simulation","Inductors","Strontium","Switching circuits","Voltage","Analytical models","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","equivalent circuits","magnetic amplifiers","power convertors","pulse width modulation","SPICE","switched networks","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large signal behaviour","static conditions","magamp post regulators","average functional behavior","saturable reactor","magnetic amplifier","voltage-coded signal","effective duty cycle","SPICE-compatible equivalent circuit","switched inductor","small signal behavior","dynamic conditions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APEC.1992.228332","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '92 Seventh Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '92 Seventh Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel2/615/5915/00228332.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1992.228332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SPICE compatible model of magamp post regulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=228332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A SPICE compatible model of magamp post regulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/228332/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4382072","conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SPICE compatible model of magamp post regulators","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00228332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040721S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1992","isNumber":"5915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"615","citationCount":"7","articleId":"228332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":228333,"authors":[{"name":"E.X.

The bidirectional converter employs a buck and boost topology using FET devices for both switches. ZVS is obtained by selecting the power stage inductance so that the switches always turn on when the MOSFET body diode is conducting. A four-module, multiphase topology is employed to significantly reduce the input and output ripple current. Besides obtaining high efficiency and light weight, the converter is also shown to possess excellent small-signal characteristics.

The proposed approach has three main advantages: control implementation is very simple; large-signal stability, nonoscillatory response of all state variables, and short settling time are ensured in any operating condition; and the transfer capacitor can become very small, since decoupling of input and output stages is not required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1992.228383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5915","startPage":"395","endPage":"402","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '92 Seventh Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel2/615/5915/00228383.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance optimization of Cuk converters by sliding-mode control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/228383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance optimization of Cuk converters by sliding-mode control","conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4382021","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance optimization of Cuk converters by sliding-mode control","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00228383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085559S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1992","isNumber":"5915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"615","citationCount":"26","articleId":"228383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":228422,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

The power system includes the generator and its switching inverter, a filtering capacitor, a distribution network, and an electrical load. The network comprises a series resistor and inductor, while the load comprises a parallel resistor, capacitor, and power sink. The voltage at the load is regulated by adjusting the rotor angles at which the inverter switches. A method by which a load-voltage controller can be successfully designed for a power system sourced by a VRG is presented. The method employs averaging, global and local linearization, and model order reduction to facilitate the design. With the help of these techniques, a state full-state feedback controller with integral error action is designed. It appears that the controller works quite well. Transients caused by load changes clear quickly without significant overshoot or undershoot; there is no steady-state voltage regulation error: and the load voltage ripple is quite small. Preliminary experimental evidence confirms these expectations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1992.228422","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '92 Seventh Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel2/615/5915/00228422.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1992.228422","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '92 Seventh Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The control of high-speed variable-reluctance generators in electric power systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=228422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"The control of high-speed variable-reluctance generators in electric power systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/228422/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4381982","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The control of high-speed variable-reluctance generators in electric power systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00228422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039704S","chronDate":"23-27 Feb 1992","isNumber":"5915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"615","citationCount":"10","articleId":"228422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":228434,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

In heavily doped substrates, a backside contact is an alternative method for noise reduction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229245","publicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/662/5918/00229245.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of substrate coupling in mixed-signal MOS circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229245/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of substrate coupling in mixed-signal MOS circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4427063","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of substrate coupling in mixed-signal MOS circuits","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00229245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037869S","chronDate":"4-6 June 1992","isNumber":"5918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"662","citationCount":"39","articleId":"229245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":229246,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The DRAM accepts a 5 V external power supply and generates 3.3 V on chip. The chip photomicrograph is provided with a magnified portion of the regulator. The internal voltage V/sub INT/ is regulated at 3.3 V (25 degrees C), while V/sub DD/ varies from 3.3 to 6.2 V. V/sub INT/ presents a positive temperature coefficient, which is adjustable, to compensate the higher cell leakage and the slowdown of MOSFET operations at higher temperature. While V/sub DD/ is raised above 6.3 V, the regulator enters the burn-in mode where V/sub INT/ follows a 2/3 V/sub DD/ curve, which gives an exact internal burn-in voltage as desired. This internal burn-in voltage is insensitive to temperature and process variations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229268","publicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/662/5918/00229268.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new on-chip voltage regulator for high density CMOS DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new on-chip voltage regulator for high density CMOS DRAMs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4422323","publicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 1992","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new on-chip voltage regulator for high density CMOS DRAMs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00229268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030683S","chronDate":"4-6 June 1992","isNumber":"5918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"662","citationCount":"2","articleId":"229268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":229269,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

A feedback loop sets the V/sub pp/ level to exactly that required to write a full '1' level to the memory cell, independent of process or operating condition. The need for double-boosted nodes is eliminated, making the V/sub pp/ level th highest voltage on the chip and easing voltage stress problems. The V/sub pp/ supply is also employed in a modulated input-threshold world-line repeater, which regenerates the world-line signal to overcome RC delay. Significant area savings can be realized in high-density DRAMs by multiplexing sense amplifiers between adjacent arrays, using n-channel isolation devices controlled by V/sub pp/ level signals. A final use of the regulated V/sub pp/ supply is in an n-channel only output buffer achieving full rail-to-rail swing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.1992.229269","publicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/662/5918/00229269.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a high-voltage pumped supply for low-power DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 1992","displayDocTitle":"Application of a high-voltage pumped supply for low-power DRAM","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4422322","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a high-voltage pumped supply for low-power DRAM","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00229269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028878S","chronDate":"4-6 June 1992","isNumber":"5918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"662","citationCount":"6","articleId":"229269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":229271,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The total bias current increases in proportion to the number of circuit cells so that a nearly constant response time is achieved. A unique dynamic current steering method is used to ensure that only a single winner exits in the final output. Experimental results for a prototype chip fabricated in a 2- mu m CMOS technology show that a cell can be a winner if its input is larger than those of the other cells by 15 mV.

A preprocessing geometry program, GEOM, is used to generate an FDTD geometry model, assuming solid surface helicopter structure.","doi":"10.1109/15.229421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/5922/00229421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.229421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5922","startPage":"192","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain method for electromagnetic radiation, interference, and interaction with complex structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain method for electromagnetic radiation, interference, and interaction with complex structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4456168","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference time-domain method for electromagnetic radiation, interference, and interaction with complex structures","sourcePdf":"00229421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059659S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"5922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"30","articleId":"229421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":229423,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A problem of practical interest, related to crosstalk, is formulated to be solved using the FEM. The technique is first applied to obtain the field distribution, and then the field is used to calculate transmission line parameters of conducting tracks on printed circuit boards.

Two levels of models are developed to analyze the error and recovery processes inside an operating system and the interactions among multiple copies of an operating system running in a distributed environment.

TVM problems require not only assigning wires or nets between terminals to one of two layers without an intersection, but also minimizing the number of vias, which are the single contacts between the nets in the two layers. The goal of the algorithm is to embed the maximum number of nets without an intersection. Two types of TVM problems are examined: split rectangular TVM (RTVM) problems and split circular TVM (CTVM) problems. The algorithms require 3n processing elements for the n-net split RTVM problems, and 5n processing elements for the n-net split CTVM problems. The algorithms were verified by solving seven problems with 20 to 80 nets.

The application of globally convergent probability-one homotopy methods to various systems of nonlinear equations that arise in circuit simulation is discussed. The coercivity conditions required for such methods are established using concepts from circuit theory. The theoretical claims of global convergence for such methods are substantiated by experiments with a collection of examples that have proved difficult for commercial simulation packages that do not use homotopy methods. Moreover, by careful design of the homotopy equations, the performance of the homotopy methods can be made quite reasonable.

It is shown in theory that it is possible to increase optical gain by more than 10 dB for optical signals around the wavelength of 1.55 mu m, compared with conventional EDFAs without filters. It is also shown that the gain improvement at longer wavelengths away from the amplifier gain peak is much higher than that of the EDFA with an optical isolator within the amplifier length. The optimum filter position is found to be around 42% of the total amplifier length from the input end. The effects of filter insertion loss and pump loss are discussed. This amplifier can be used as an optical preamplifier in a receiver for a wide range of wavelengths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical filters","Optical receivers","Optical pumping","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Optical losses","Optical fiber amplifiers","Isolators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","laser theory","optical communication equipment","optical filters","optical losses","optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EDFA","Er-doped fibre amplifiers","IR","optical receivers","erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","optical filters","EDFAs","enhanced optical gain","narrow-bandpass optical filters","amplifier length","gain improvement","amplifier gain peak","optimum filter position","filter insertion loss","pump loss","optical preamplifier","receiver","10 dB","1.55 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.229802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/5932/00229802.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.229802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of optical gain enhanced erbium-doped fiber amplifiers using optical filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of optical gain enhanced erbium-doped fiber amplifiers using optical filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229802/","volume":"5","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4522028","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of optical gain enhanced erbium-doped fiber amplifiers using optical filters","sourcePdf":"00229802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038784S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"5932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"7","articleId":"229802","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":229804,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Theoretical distortion curves as a function of bias have been calculated and experimentally verified. These curves show that (single octave) linear dynamic range increases as the bias is lowered, so long as optical power at the detector can be maintained just below the saturation level or laser noise limit. This method thus provides a way for very large optical power to be used to benefit linear dynamic range. Theoretically, 20 dB of excess optical power, attenuated through low biasing, can result in an increase in linear dynamic range of 15 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/5932/00229804.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.229804","doi":"10.1109/68.229804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229804","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Optical distortion","Optical attenuators","Optical saturation","Optical noise","Optical modulation","Laser noise","Laser theory","Power lasers","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optics","noise","optical modulation","optical saturation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear dynamic range","low biasing","Mach-Zehnder modulator","optical bias","distortion curves","single octave","optical power","saturation level","laser noise limit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Increased linear dynamic range by low biasing the Mach-Zehnder modulator","accessionNumber":"4522030","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","volume":"5","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased linear dynamic range by low biasing the Mach-Zehnder modulator","sourcePdf":"00229804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027261S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"5932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"109","articleId":"229804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":229805,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A complete constructive method that yields all orthogonal two channel filter banks, where the filters have rational transfer functions, is given, and it is shown how these can be used to generate orthonormal wavelet bases. A family of orthonormal wavelets that have a maximum number of disappearing moments is shown to be generated by the halfband Butterworth filters. When there is an odd number of zeros at pi it is shown that closed forms for the filters are available without need for factorization. A still larger class of orthonormal wavelet bases having the same moment properties and containing the Daubechies and Butterworth filters as the limiting cases is presented. It is shown that it is possible to have both linear phase and orthogonality in the infinite impulse response case, and a constructive method is given. It is also shown how compactly supported bases may be orthogonalized, and bases for the spline function spaces are constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.229887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5934/00229887.pdf","startPage":"2536","endPage":"2556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.229887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelets and recursive filter banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229887/","displayDocTitle":"Wavelets and recursive filter banks","volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4532811","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelets and recursive filter banks","sourcePdf":"00229887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043576S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"167","articleId":"229887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":229888,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The online algorithms are sequential expectation maximization (EM) schemes and are derived by using stochastic approximations to maximize the Kullback-Leibler information measure.

They yield estimates of the HMM parameters including transition probabilities, Markov state levels, and noise variance. In contrast to the offline EM algorithm (Baum-Welch scheme), which uses the fixed-interval forward-backward scheme, the online schemes have significantly reduced memory requirements and improved convergence, and they can estimate HMM parameters that vary slowly with time or undergo infrequent jump changes. Similar techniques are used to derive online schemes for extracting finite-state Markov chains imbedded in a mixture of white Gaussian noise (WGN) and deterministic signals of known functional form with unknown parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line estimation of hidden Markov model parameters based on the Kullback-Leibler information measure","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.229888","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5934/00229888.pdf","startPage":"2557","endPage":"2573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.229888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"On-line estimation of hidden Markov model parameters based on the Kullback-Leibler information measure","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4532812","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line estimation of hidden Markov model parameters based on the Kullback-Leibler information measure","sourcePdf":"00229888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032874S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"188","articleId":"229888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":229890,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

This model leads to the derivation of texture analysis and synthesis algorithms designed to estimate the texture parameters and to reconstruct the original texture field from these parameters. The texture field is assumed to be a realization of a regular homogeneous random field, which is characterized in general by a mixed spectral distribution. The texture field is orthogonally decomposed into a purely indeterministic component and a deterministic component. The deterministic component is further orthogonally decomposed into a harmonic component, and a generalized-evanescent component. Both analytical and experimental results show that the deterministic components should be parameterized separately from the purely indeterministic component. The model is very efficient in terms of the number of parameters required to faithfully represent textures. Reconstructed textures are practically indistinguishable from the originals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4532821","displayDocTitle":"A unified texture model based on a 2-D Wold-like decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified texture model based on a 2-D Wold-like decomposition","sourcePdf":"00229897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052639S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"130","articleId":"229897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":229898,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In many applications, the common signal is not Gaussian and there may be no prior knowledge of its detailed structure. Instead, estimation of a hypothesized common signal can be construed as another element in the estimation process. The analysis is straightforward and shows that the complex ambiguity function (CAF) still represents the ML approach when the noise is Gaussian and spectrally flat. Additional interpretation shows that use of interference-rejection filtering followed by a CAF is an attractive suboptimum approach in an environment of narrowband interferers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","volume":"41","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"4532825","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Differential delay/Doppler ML estimation with unknown signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential delay/Doppler ML estimation with unknown signals","sourcePdf":"00229901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0279S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"98","articleId":"229901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":229903,"authors":[{"name":"C.Z.

Various types of short-word length signed-digit coefficients are investigated. A pole-zero analysis method gives an indication of the range of specifications that can be met for each type.

For a given set of admissible quantizers for coding a discrete nonstationary signal sequence in a buffer-constrained environment, and for any global distortion minimization criterion that is additive over the individual elements of the sequence, the optimal solution and slightly suboptimal but much faster approximations are formulated. The problem is first defined as one of constrained, discrete optimization, and its equivalence to some problems in integer programming is established. Dynamic programming using the Viterbi algorithm is shown to provide a way of computing the optimal solution. A heuristic algorithm based on Lagrangian optimization and using an operational rate-distortion framework that, with much-reduced computing complexity, approaches the optimally achievable SNR is provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.229981","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5935/00229981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.229981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935","startPage":"192","endPage":"195 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal buffer-constrained source quantization and fast approximations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal buffer-constrained source quantization and fast approximations","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229981/","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399318","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal buffer-constrained source quantization and fast approximations","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00229981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05077S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"14","articleId":"229981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":229983,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Motion compensation is achieved using enlarged and overlapped blocks. When motion estimation is executed, a window function operates on the prediction error signals. The power of the resulting signal is calculated and used for motion vector evaluation. When motion-compensated prediction is executed, the same window function operates on the prediction signals. The total prediction signal is generated by summing up all the block signals obtained. With this scheme, prediction signals without blocking edges are obtained. The mean square error (MSE) of the prediction error signal is reduced about 19%, and FFT analysis results show that the coefficient power in the frequency domain is concentrated in the lower frequency part. This indicates higher coding efficiency for the overlapped transforms, and for conventional block based transforms as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overlapped block motion compensation for high quality motion picture coding","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.229983","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5935/00229983.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"187 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.229983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"An overlapped block motion compensation for high quality motion picture coding","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399316","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overlapped block motion compensation for high quality motion picture coding","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00229983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050047S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"41","articleId":"229983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":229988,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

Concurrent scheduling and resource allocation algorithms that exploit interaction and intraiteration precedence constraints are introduced. These algorithms produce solutions that are as good as or better than those previously published. MARS can generate valid architectures for algorithms that have distributed arc delays and exploits these delays to produce more efficient architectures. This allows the system to be more general and provides for the synthesis of more complicated algorithms Implicit retiming and pipelining of the data flow graph are used to improve the quality of the design. Architectures that meet the iteration bound of any algorithm can be synthesized by unfolding the original data flow graph.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5935/00229988.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"167 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.229988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.229988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=229988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High level DSP synthesis using the MARS design system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Mars","Signal processing algorithms","Signal synthesis","Delay","Flow graphs","High level synthesis","Signal design","Resource management","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","digital signal processing chips","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP architectures synthesis","concurrent scheduling","level DSP synthesis","MARS design system","high-level synthesis","Minnesota architecture synthesis","resource allocation algorithms","distributed arc delays","efficient architectures","retiming","pipelining","data flow graph","iteration bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/229988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"High level DSP synthesis using the MARS design system","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4399311","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High level DSP synthesis using the MARS design system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00229988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067162S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"18","articleId":"229988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":229991,"authors":[{"name":"Yuk-Hee Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yuk-Hee Chan","id":"37289428700"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wan-Chi Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0593-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"229991","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"abstract":"Two fast discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithms, the radix-3 and radix-6 algorithms, are proposed.
