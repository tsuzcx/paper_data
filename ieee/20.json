The generated connectionist expert system consists of many features, such as operation of forward and backward inference based on partial input information, online learning, noisy data handling, generalization, and the explanation ability. Two sample problems, the Knowledge Base Evaluator 1 and Treatment of Posiboost, are considered in order to illustrate the workings of the connectionist expert system. The training algorithm, which has network generating ability, is presented to build the knowledge base of the connectionist expert system. It provides the abilities needed to realize the described features of the connectionist expert system. This proposed system can be easily used to build expert systems quickly, and the inferencing in the developed systems will be fast.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 March 1992","conferenceDate":"2-6 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4292454","displayDocTitle":"Building expert systems by training with automatic neural network generating ability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building expert systems by training with automatic neural network generating ability","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032067S","chronDate":"2-6 March 1992","isNumber":"5200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"396","articleId":"200030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":200036,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

MICAH, a genetic algorithm system integrated with a MCTP solver for solving MCTPs, is described. An MCTP consists of nodes that either produce or acquire commodities and arcs that are used for the transportation of commodities between the different nodes. The objective is to maximize the total amount of commodities transported between the nodes while minimizing the transportation cost. Multicommodity transshipment problems are combinatorially explosive problems that have no known polynomial-time algorithms for obtaining optimal solutions. MCTP problems belong to the NP-complete class of problems. The solution obtained from MICAH for a real-world MCTP transports 38% more commodities compared to the solution obtained from a combination of a MCTP solver and manual routing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CAIA.1992.200036","startPage":"240","endPage":"246","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/396/5200/00200036.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAIA.1992.200036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MICAH: a genetic algorithm system for multi-commodity transshipment problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Vehicles","Routing","Costs","Cities and towns","Upper bound","Computer science","Rail transportation","Job shop scheduling","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","problem solving","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicommodity transshipment problem","vehicle routing problem","MICAH","genetic algorithm system","MCTP solver","transportation cost","combinatorially explosive problems","polynomial-time algorithms","NP-complete"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 March 1992","displayDocTitle":"MICAH: a genetic algorithm system for multi-commodity transshipment problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 March 1992","accessionNumber":"4292460","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MICAH: a genetic algorithm system for multi-commodity transshipment problems","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029892S","chronDate":"2-6 March 1992","isNumber":"5200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"396","citationCount":"4","articleId":"200036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":200227,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The Kumada motor is based on a stator consisting of a piezoelectric revolving resonator. Its center of mass rotates around the geometric center drawing a circle a few micrometers in radius, at a very high speed of about several million revolutions per minute. The revolving motion is excited with a four-phase rotating voltage with a frequency of several tens of kilohertz. The stator of the motor has several kinds of shapes. An advantage offered by this motor is the concept of direct drive. As an example a novel type of clock is described with minute and hour hands driven independently and directly by two stators without gears and pivots.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/592/5203/00200227.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1990 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAF.1990.200227","doi":"10.1109/ISAF.1990.200227","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1990 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Torque","Micromotors","Gears","Stators","Production","Electrodes","Resonant frequency","Electronic equipment","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piezoelectric motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery driven motors","IC-controlled m-watt ultrasonic motor","Kumada motor","piezoelectric revolving resonator","center of mass","geometric center","revolving motion","four-phase rotating voltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200227/","displayDocTitle":"Piezoelectric revolving motors applicable for future purpose","accessionNumber":"4324232","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 1990","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piezoelectric revolving motors applicable for future purpose","confLoc":"Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00200227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032449S","chronDate":"6-8 Jun 1990","isNumber":"5203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"592","citationCount":"2","articleId":"200227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":200237,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

In wave pipelining, multiple coherent waves of data are placed between storage elements by clocking the circuit faster than the propagation delay of the combinational logic. If all the propagation paths from the combinational circuit inputs to outputs have approximately the same delay, each wave propagates uniformly to the outputs without interfering with adjacent waves. The wave pipelining concept has been tested using a demonstration chip. Compared to an implementation using ordinary pipelining, a wave-pipelined circuit reduces the latency, area, and clock distribution required by pipeline registers or latches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200408","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/634/5205/00200408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5205","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","startPage":"56","endPage":"57","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","displayDocTitle":"A bipolar population counter using wave pipelining to achieve 2.5* normal clock frequency","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4358704","publicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bipolar population counter using wave pipelining to achieve 2.5* normal clock frequency","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035916S","chronDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","isNumber":"5205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"634","citationCount":"6","articleId":"200408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":200409,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The loaded characteristic impedance of stripline signal traces on a printed-circuit board can be about 50 Omega . When there is more than one driver, the transmission line must be terminated at both ends to prevent reflections. System arbitration allows only one driver access to a line at any time. The load seen by each driver is about 25 Omega . The power dissipated is reduced if the signal voltage swing and the Vol level are small. The minimum voltage swing must be large enough to assure acceptable noise margin.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200409","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/634/5205/00200409.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5205","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","startPage":"58","endPage":"59","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS low-voltage-swing transmission-line transceiver","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4358705","publicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS low-voltage-swing transmission-line transceiver","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046782S","chronDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","isNumber":"5205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"634","citationCount":"68","articleId":"200409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":200440,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Integration of peripheral drives has advantages over conventional AMLCDs such as easy testing and liberation from driver assembly, enabling fabrication of a high-resolution LCD with a small pixel size. Because a defect in a monolithic driver results in a fatal line defect, redundancy is required to improve yield. This data driver consists of blocks of shift registers using CMOS DFF. By using poly-silicon TFTs, a sample hold time of about 40 ns is achieved for 15-V gate voltage and 12-V data signal. These values are sufficient for the LCD for NTSC with 640 data lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thin film transistors","Shift registers","Driver circuits","Active matrix liquid crystal displays","Testing","Laser beam cutting","Liquid crystal displays","Capacitors","Grain boundaries","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","liquid crystal displays","redundancy","thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LC data driver","redundancy","polysilicon thin-film transistor","active-matrix-liquid-crystal display","peripheral drives","pixel size","fatal line defect","yield","shift registers","sample hold time","gate voltage","data signal","NTSC","40 ns","12 V","15 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200440","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/634/5205/00200440.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A poly-Si TFT monolithic LC data driver with redundancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A poly-Si TFT monolithic LC data driver with redundancy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200440/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4358725","conferenceDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A poly-Si TFT monolithic LC data driver with redundancy","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041154S","chronDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","isNumber":"5205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"634","citationCount":"6","articleId":"200440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":200448,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Since the cell-source voltage during erase is only 5 V, high source-junction breakdown voltage is not necessary, making a smaller cell feasible.

The low reflectance and good step coverage characteristics of a tungsten photoshield, combined with a frame-interline-transfer scheme, reduces the smear level to -110 dB. The tungsten photoshield also acts as a shunt bus line, supplying transfer pulses to vertical CCD (V-CCD) electrodes, so that a 1.2*10/sup 5/-electron charge-handling capability is obtained at a frame transfer frequency of 1 MHz. Tungsten-and-aluminum-shunt (TAS) wiring, used in a horizontal CCD (H-CCD), suppresses vertical line pair fixed-pattern noise, even at a smaller transfer pulse amplitudes. TAS wiring also helps reduce power consumption in the H-CCD by 2/3 compared to that achieved with conventional wiring.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/634/5205/00200466.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1992.200466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2 M pixel HDTV CCD image sensor with tungsten photo-shield and H-CCD shunt wiring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","HDTV","Charge-coupled image sensors","Tungsten","Wiring","Charge coupled devices","Optical devices","Optical sensors","Lenses","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","high definition television","MOS integrated circuits","tungsten"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H-CCD shunt wiring","frame-interline-transfer scheme","smear level","frame transfer frequency","power consumption","1 in","2 Mpixel","W photoshield"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","displayDocTitle":"A 2 M pixel HDTV CCD image sensor with tungsten photo-shield and H-CCD shunt wiring","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2 M pixel HDTV CCD image sensor with tungsten photo-shield and H-CCD shunt wiring","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040656S","chronDate":"19-21 Feb. 1992","isNumber":"5205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"634","citationCount":"6","articleId":"200466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":200467,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The pixel size of this device is effectively the same as that of a 1-in optical-format 2-Mpixel CCD image sensor.

Simulation and experimental results show the proposed synapse circuit to possess a number of favorable characteristics, including very infrequent refresh and fine programming granularity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200514/","accessionNumber":"4358916","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integrated circuit neural networks using ferroelectric analog memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated circuit neural networks using ferroelectric analog memory","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00200514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067859S","chronDate":"1-3 April 1992","isNumber":"5206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"644","articleId":"200514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":200541,"authors":[{"name":"J.-A.

The homogeneous link transformation matrix is decomposed into products of translation/rotation matrices, each of which is implemented via an augmented CORDIC as a processing element. A specific scheme is proposed for a six-link robot kinematics processor utilizing full pipelining at the macro level and parallel redundant arithmetic and full pipelining at the micro level. The performance of the scheme is analyzed with respect to the time to compute one location of the end-effector of a six-link manipulator and the number of transistors required. This scheme is assessed to produce a single-chip VLSI utilizing state-of-the-art MOS technology.

The true statistics of the random variable representing the interferers is employed, and no bit synchronization among the transmitters is assumed. The chip asynchronous case has also been considered, leading to slightly better performance than the chip synchronous one.

The key feature of the MVP technology is the formation of a hemispherical grain (HSG) archipelago and its transference to the underlayered oxide. The HSG archipelago pattern is produced on the oxide layer, and, by using that pattern as an etch mask, the oxide archipelago pattern is again transferred to the storage poly for the formation of villus bars by anisotropic dry etch. After the etching process, the oxide etch mask pattern is stripped away by using oxide wet etchant, so that additional Fin undercut structure is achieved underneath the main body. The main body of the storage electrode can be formed by single deposition and etch process, so that the storage electrode structure is strong enough to maintain its physical stability in spite of the complication of its shape.

The basic cell concept is an evolution from IBM's SPT cell and a modified SPT cell. Ground-rule shrinkage and additional features permit the realization of a cell size of 1.5 mu m/sup 2/. The chip incorporates N-array transfer gates isolated from the P-substrate by an intervening buried N-layer which forms the buried plate for the trench capacitor. The N-array devices, isolated P-well, and low-resistance wordline conductors provide a dense cell with superior soft-error-rate (SER) protection. Density improvement is achieved by the use of fully borderless contacts and ground-rule shrinkage. The interconnects use a Damascene metallization scheme that repeatedly applies chemical-mechanical polishes for dielectrics and metals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Isolation technology","Dielectrics","Capacitors","Conductors","Protection","Boron","Tungsten","Metallization","Chemicals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","integrated circuit technology","metallisation","polishing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buried-plate trench cell","DRAM","modified SPT cell","N-array transfer gates","isolated P-well","low-resistance wordline conductors","dense cell","soft-error-rate","fully borderless contacts","ground-rule shrinkage","Damascene metallization scheme","chemical-mechanical polishes","64 Mbit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200620","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.1992.200620","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel2/661/5207/00200620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.1992.200620","startPage":"14","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5207","publicationTitle":"1992 Symposium on VLSI Technology Digest of Technical Papers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A buried-plate trench cell for a 64-Mb DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A buried-plate trench cell for a 64-Mb DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 1992","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353410","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A buried-plate trench cell for a 64-Mb DRAM","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00200620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033018S","chronDate":"2-4 June 1992","isNumber":"5207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"661","citationCount":"7","articleId":"200620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":200622,"authors":[{"name":"K.F.

A noncoherent detection algorithm is presented with an example. The algorithm takes advantage of the mid-bit samples of the received signal by correlating them with a set of hypotheses. The best hypothesis is chosen and the mid-bit estimates are differentially detected in the inphase and quadrature separately to yield the transmitted bits. Simulation results are shown to illustrate the performance of the technique for channels typical of the mobile communication scenarios. The performances are shown to be as good as pi /4-QPSK with multiple symbol differential detection. The performances are compared with pi /4-QPSK for a typical single channel per carrier system with adjacent channel interference. The O-QPSK scheme is shown to be significantly better than pi /4-QPSK for all practical scenarios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICWC.1992.200721","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/666/5208/00200721.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWC.1992.200721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent detection of hardlimited O-QPSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent detection of hardlimited O-QPSK","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200721/","conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4348467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent detection of hardlimited O-QPSK","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141107S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","articleId":"200721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":200723,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The scheme employs space-division multiplexing by means of an adaptive antenna array at the base station (1) to separate the temporally and spectrally overlapping signals of users that arrive from different locations within the cell and to mitigate multipath fading and shadowing at the base station and (2) by reciprocity to transmit directively to minimize interfering signals arriving at the mobile units and to mitigate multipath fading and shadowing at the mobile units. A novel aspect of the proposed scheme is that no training signals are required for adaptation, nor are computationally intensive direction-finding methods required, nor is any calibration data required for the array. Results from computer simulations on the performance of the new scheme show that the proposed scheme can accommodate up to five times as many users as a proposed CDMA scheme using the same system bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICWC.1992.200723","startPage":"102","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/666/5208/00200723.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWC.1992.200723","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplication of cellular radio capacity by blind adaptive spatial filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Multiplication of cellular radio capacity by blind adaptive spatial filtering","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4348469","conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplication of cellular radio capacity by blind adaptive spatial filtering","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117914S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","citationCount":"18","articleId":"200723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":200737,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Birchler","affiliation":["Land Mobile Products Sector Research, Motorola, Inc.orporated, Schaumburg, IL, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Birchler","id":"37388795200"},{"name":"S.C.

Using a combination of digital speech coding, time division multiple access (TDMA), and spectrally efficient linear modulation technologies, up to 6 voice links are supported per 25 kHz RF channel. A key feature of the system is a new modulation method, M-16QAM, which makes possible high speed signaling in land mobile radio channels without the use of an equalizer. After a brief description of the overall system, including the TDMA frame/slot structure and speech coder, focus is shifted to the modulation technique. The motivation behind M-16QAM, as well as its design and simulated performance, are discussed in more detail. Results of field trials of an experimental modem are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICWC.1992.200737","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/666/5208/00200737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWC.1992.200737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 64 kbps digital land mobile radio system employing M-16QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 64 kbps digital land mobile radio system employing M-16QAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200737/","conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4342241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 64 kbps digital land mobile radio system employing M-16QAM","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035823S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","citationCount":"14","articleId":"200737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":200746,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

Unfortunately, they do not offer a good power spectral density (PSD). There were two approaches examined for improving the PSD. The first approach provides an improved PSD through spreading the RW functions with a long PN code while increasing sensitivity to time base error. The second method ensures that the system is less sensitive to time base errors by using a fixed sequence of the optimal set of RW functions based on cross-correlation values. Thus, for short-range applications RW functions may offer superior performance to that achieved by conventional CDMA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/666/5208/00200746.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWC.1992.200746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWC.1992.200746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal short-range CDMA codes of length 16 for wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","Base stations","Interference","Narrowband","Indoor environments","Delay","Timing","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","codes","radiocommunication","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rademacher-Walsh functions","code length","wireless communications","optimal short-range CDMA codes","time base error","propagation delay differences","PN code","cross-correlation values","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Optimal short-range CDMA codes of length 16 for wireless communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353609","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal short-range CDMA codes of length 16 for wireless communications","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067008S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","citationCount":"1","articleId":"200746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":200747,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

For most applications the adjacent channel interference (ACI) is proportional to the square of the misalignment error (carrier leak, differential gain,differential phase and level error) except in the case of some higher order products of continuous phase modulation. A technique for estimating the spectrum for the above situations is described. It involves summing the weighted spectrum of each distortion product. The analysis is applicable to linear or continuous phase modulation (CPM) with or without predistortion. The spectrum estimate is particularly good for CPM signals where the error is normally much less then 1dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353643","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The effect of non-linear amplifiers and quadrature modulators on the out-of-band spectrum of digital modulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of non-linear amplifiers and quadrature modulators on the out-of-band spectrum of digital modulations","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022987S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","citationCount":"1","articleId":"200780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":200785,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

By using this approach the power savings offered by various error control protocols can be compared on a common basis. DAEC protocols are designed to make efficient use of a small number of feedback signals (with or without retransmissions) to combat the uncertain noise in mobile satellite channels. The channel models which the authors have considered include Rayleigh, Rice, and log-normal fading distributions. In particular, a proper designed DAEC protocol is shown to provide significant coding gain improvement (5-8 dB) over the comparable FEC and the conventional Type-I or Type-II hybrid ARQ protocols for delay-limited mobile applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/666/5208/00200785.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"371","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICWC.1992.200785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWC.1992.200785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of error control protocols in mobile satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Protocols","Delay","Satellites","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Signal design","Feedback","Rayleigh channels","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","fading","mobile radio systems","protocols","satellite relay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading","Rician fading","error control protocols","mobile satellite communications","coding gain","delay-limited adaptive error control","power savings","feedback signals","retransmissions","log-normal fading","delay-limited mobile applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of error control protocols in mobile satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353648","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of error control protocols in mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048713S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","articleId":"200785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":200803,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Their noise-like characteristics are explained. The numbers and lengths of chaotic sequences are not restricted like m-sequences. The performance of chaotic sequences in multiple-access communication is shown to be similar to that of PN-sequences. Furthermore, due to their noise-like appearance, chaotic sequences outperform PN-sequences in low probability of intercept (LPI). A method for generating chaotic sequences suitable for use in DS/SS system has been proposed. In this method, the spreading sequences change from one bit to the next in a very random-like fashion, causing undesired interception to be very difficult.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICWC.1992.200803","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/666/5208/00200803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWC.1992.200803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208","startPage":"437","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic sequences for spread spectrum: an alternative to PN-sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=200803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic sequences for spread spectrum: an alternative to PN-sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/200803/","conferenceDate":"25-26 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4348474","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic sequences for spread spectrum: an alternative to PN-sequences","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00200803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023558S","chronDate":"25-26 Jun 1992","isNumber":"5208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"666","citationCount":"46","articleId":"200803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":201048,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Unlike their vacuum tube predecessors, the solid-state transmitter amplifier operates from a low voltage (LV) power supply. High power at low voltage implies very high peak currents. The state of art is such that these high peak currents must be provided by energy storage capacitors located in close proximity to the RF power amplifiers. The power supply, then, must serve the function of a precision capacitor recharging circuit. The power supply is an integral part of the transmitter design and its design requirements are driven by the RF output power and transmitter stability requirements. The stability of the power supply is one of the most important factors in achieving the specified performance criteria for the radar system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MODSYM.1990.201048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5216","startPage":"146","endPage":"152","displayPublicationTitle":"Nineteenth IEEE Symposium on Power Modulators","pdfPath":"/iel2/130/5216/00201048.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power supply considerations for pulsed solid-state radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/201048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Power supply considerations for pulsed solid-state radar","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4039368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power supply considerations for pulsed solid-state radar","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00201048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023626S","chronDate":"26-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"5216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"130","citationCount":"6","articleId":"201048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":201086,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

Results for both probabilistic and deterministic targets in the presence of complex-Gaussian clutter are presented. The results of these studies indicate that the PWF and the ILRT typically achieve near optimal performance.

The aberration correction scheme is a nonmodel-based technique which makes use of the statistical randomness in the clutter region. It is capable of correcting phase distortions due to frequency dispersion incurred in the ionospheric propagation paths. Simulation shows that with this technique the phase distorted signal can be restored to within 1 dB loss of the undistorted signal. In order to retain the possibility of correcting phase aberration at the array element level, a two-step beamforming technique has been implemented by providing a spatial filter to exclude the strong RFI and jammers at the element level and by applying conventional beamforming on the receiver residue which contains only clutter return and local noise. The phase aberration technique is applied between the two steps after the major interferers are canceled.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/201143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3832679","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and aberration correction in HF radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and aberration correction in HF radar","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00201143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032583S","chronDate":"7-10 May 1990","isNumber":"5217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"151","citationCount":"1","articleId":"201143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":201168,"authors":[{"name":"Rongquing Xu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Rongquing Xu","id":"37285993300"},{"name":"Zhidao Cao","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhidao Cao","id":"37382175900"},{"name":"Yongtan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yongtan Liu","id":"37384092800"}],"articleNumber":"201168","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"abstract":"A detailed consideration of the accuracy requirement for the compensation for the inverse synthetic aperture radar is presented.

One method for encapsulating this information is in the form of a model which is known a priori. Another approach is to train a segmentation method by large numbers of examples of the types of texture encountered. This latter approach underlies the use of noncommittal neural networks.

This makes it possible in the case of planar samples to look at the effect of the thickness for identical applied fields. The pressure wave propagation method was used for the measurements. The results indicate that increasing the thickness of the insulator does not increase the charge densities which develop in it under applied field. The observed space charge is localized in the vicinity of the electrodes, in a region extending over 0.7 mm, in which the diffusion of impurities from the semiconducting electrodes is very important.

The type of input to the prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. Aspects of attention such as localizing spatial regions of interest and ordering their importance are addressed; other aspects of attention such as the role of task guidance are encompassed by the model but are not detailed here.

Then, the authors present the system obtained by making such a framework utilize the learning methodology proposed by R. Michalski (1980) for INDUCE. The authors have specialized this methodology in order to cope with image recognition problems.

The range data on different curves of intersection, such as, vertical, horizontal, and circular, with the 3D face are used as the distinguishing surface features. These are robust against changes in makeup and lighting as compared to the 2D approach, and more efficient for computation and data storage than other 3D approaches. The performance of this method for human face identification is evaluated through several matching experiments. It has been observed that the curves of intersection crossing the facial central area vertically and contain the features, like, nose and mouth, have the major distinctiveness. Those crossing near the inner corners of the eyes and a part of the nose are also effective for human face identification. But it seems that such an effectiveness requires the accurate extraction of the sections against their locational variations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1992.201567","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings. 11th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings. 11th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/426/5221/00201567.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1992.201567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D facial image analysis for human identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=201567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Aug-3 Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/201567/","displayDocTitle":"3D facial image analysis for human identification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4286661","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D facial image analysis for human identification","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00201567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040445S","chronDate":"30 Aug-3 Sep 1992","isNumber":"5221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"426","citationCount":"37","articleId":"201567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":201616,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The model consists of two sensory subsystems: preattentive peripheral feature detection and high resolution foveal image identification based on a hypercolumnar representation. Visual objects are non-explicitly stored in two sparsely coded associative memories separating fixation locations for identities of foveal views. An egocentric interest map integrates bottom-up and top-down information sources and decides when to generate a camera movement. A selective masking of preattentive processes supports a cooperation with cognitive object recognition. The system is easily extendible, copes with occlusions and distortions and can be driven in different modes for exploration tasks. This model is able to perform visual search and reproduce findings in the human visual system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1992.201648","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings. 11th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings. 11th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/426/5221/00201648.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1992.201648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5221","startPage":"664","endPage":"667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saccadic object recognition with an active vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=201648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Saccadic object recognition with an active vision system","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Aug-3 Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/201648/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4292740","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saccadic object recognition with an active vision system","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00201648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038376S","chronDate":"30 Aug-3 Sep 1992","isNumber":"5221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"426","citationCount":"13","articleId":"201648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":201708,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

This type of neural networks is considered as a generic system implementing a generic model. The final network resultant from the architecturing and training is seen as an instance of this generic system, and thus an implemented instance of the generic model. Disregarding the hardware fault tolerance, the description length of the network and that of the performance deviation from the ideal given training samples must be smaller than that of the original samples. This total description length must be the minimum among all possible states. Constrained by the MDL principle, an MLFF neural network can be automatically architectured and trained through an evolutionary mechanism in which the network will be allowed and enabled to automatically expand as well as to reduce its complexity of architecture. The resultant network is of a partially connected MLFF architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Aug-3 Sep 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/201714/","accessionNumber":"4293024","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An MDL-principled evolutionary mechanism to automatic architecturing of pattern recognition neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MDL-principled evolutionary mechanism to automatic architecturing of pattern recognition neural network","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00201714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031592S","chronDate":"30 Aug-3 Sep 1992","isNumber":"5222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"427","citationCount":"2","articleId":"201714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":201716,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The classification of remotely sensed multispectral data using classical statistical methods has been worked on for several decades. Among the multispectral data, we concentrate on the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image data which has been available since 1984. Using this classical maximum likelihood approach, a category is modeled as a multivariate normal distribution; however, the distribution for Landsat images is unknown. It is well known that NN approaches have the ability to classify without assuming a distribution.

Theory and experiments suggest that adaptive finite elements is a natural and computationally-powerful approach to image approximation problems. The particular representation is based on hierarchical finite elements. A multiresolution algorithm computes the solution to the approximation problem in O(N) time on a sequential machine and in O(logN) time on a single-instruction, multiple-data, fine-grain parallel architecture, where N is the number of pixels in the image.

The authors introduce a modification of the semi-continuous codebook updating which allows rapid speaker adaptation. The approach is based on the idea that phonetic information already incorporated in a trained model should be used to update the codebook. Thus the different acoustic representation of a new speaker is learned while the connection between codebook entries and model states remains the same. Several experiments were carried out with a small speech sample. It is possible to demonstrate that the new codebook updating performs better than conventional SCHMM codebook updating and that using a speech sample comprising about 40 seconds of adaptation speech is enough to achieve 50 percent of the difference in performance between full speaker-dependent training and no adaptation at all.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1992.202044","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., 11th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition.

The concentration-contour method consists of four phases: (1) concentration of pattern, (2) extraction of contour, (3) transformation of numerical features, and (4) classification. The diagonal-diagonal regional projection transformation (DDRPT), which converts a compound pattern into an integral object, has been used. A VLSI architecture to implement the concentration-contour approach has been designed.

Due to the wide range of possible neural network paradigms and the rapid evolution of these models, high degree of implementation flexibility if essential. The Dynamically Reconfigurable Extended Array Multiprocessor (DREAM) Machine has been specifically designed for implementation of neural networks. The architecture offers sufficient flexibility for use on a wide range of neural network applications. The authors describe the basic computational and communicational requirements of neural network models. A mapping method is proposed that can take advantage of the DREAM Machine's reconfigurable interconnection network to achieve efficient implementations for a diverse range of neural network structures. The effectiveness of the architecture and the mapping method is demonstrated through the use of several examples and shown to be superior to previous systolic implementation methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1992.202167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1992.202167","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., 11th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition.

A multiresolution representation of the scene is scanned with a matched filter based on local orientation for the reliable localization of human faces. For the identification of the faces, two complementary strategies are used. At low resolution, the three most important features of a face (head, eye pairs, and nose/mouth/chin) are compared with the contents of a database. At high resolution, the precise location of several landmark features is determined, and this geometrical description is used for comparisons in a 62-dimensional vector space. These algorithms were used in an experimental access control system-the digital doorkeeper-to investigate its performance under realistic conditions. Without screening for spectacles, beards. changing hairstyle, etc. a recognition rate of 90% among known persons was achieved.

One example, describing a filter with a length of 40 coefficients and 10-b wordlength, is used for comparison to a previously reported identical design problem which was solved with a general-purpose integer programming algorithm. This comparison reveals that the genetic algorithm produces a better Chebyshev approximation to the desired frequency response. The second example describes the results of the application of the genetic algorithm to the design of a high-order filter developed for the processing of seismic signals.

GenLearn uses techniques from the field of genetic algorithms to perform a global search of weight space and, thereby, to avoid the common problem of getting stuck in local minima. GenLearn is based on survival of the fittest hidden neuron. In searching for the most fit hidden neurons, GenLearn searches for a globally optimal internal representation of the input data. A big advantage of the GenLearn procedure over the generalized delta rule (GDR) in training three-layered neural nets is that, during each iteration of GenLearn, each weight in the first matrix is modified only once, whereas, in the GDR procedure, each weight in the first matrix is modified once for each output-layer neuron. What makes this such a big advantage is that, although GenLearn often reaches the desired mean square error in about the same number of iterations as the GDR, each iteration takes considerably less time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202273/","accessionNumber":"4314987","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Training multilayered neural networks by replacing the least fit hidden neurons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training multilayered neural networks by replacing the least fit hidden neurons","confLoc":"Birmingham, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"00202273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035619S","chronDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","isNumber":"5226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"617","citationCount":"2","articleId":"202273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":202274,"authors":[{"name":"W.T.

In the star topology proposed, very strict synchronization of transmitters and equalization of propagation delays over various paths in the network is achieved since a single optical source is used for the whole network, and all the signals follow that same path around the network. Other advantages are that the operation mode of the optical source is pulsed, not continuous-wave, and the attenuation variations among interfering signals are low. The major disadvantage of the proposed system is in its stricter power constraints. This problem can be alleviated by the insertion of optical amplifiers when the number of stations outgrows the limits of the basic network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '92","pdfPath":"/iel2/617/5226/00202295.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '92","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1992.202295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1992.202295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=202295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous CDMA technique for fiber-optic LANs with folded dual bus topology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Code division multiplexing","Optical fiber LAN","Optical transmitters","Optical attenuators","Optical fiber networks","Multiaccess communication","Stimulated emission","Pulse amplifiers","Interchannel interference","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","local area networks","network topology","optical links","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous CDMA technique","fibre-optic LAN","folded dual bus topology","interchannel interference","throughput","star topology","synchronization","transmitters","equalization","propagation delays","power constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous CDMA technique for fiber-optic LANs with folded dual bus topology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4324570","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous CDMA technique for fiber-optic LANs with folded dual bus topology","confLoc":"Birmingham, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"00202295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033258S","chronDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","isNumber":"5226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"617","articleId":"202295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":202298,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Traditional hidden Markov model speech recognition is generally based on a set of parameters which are extracted at discrete intervals. Such an analysis necessitates use of a discrete-transition hidden Markov model in which the underlying states can change only at intervals related to the frame rate of the analysis. The exact locations of the analysis windows can influence the front-end outputs. As a result, inconsistent performance can often be observed in discriminating words which differ only in short duration cues. Methods are explored which circumvent this framing effect by allowing state transitions to occur at each sample. Efficient methods for implementing this strategy are derived, and experimental results are presented, showing the superior performance of the pseudo-continuous transitions hidden Markov models compared to that of conventional discrete transition hidden Markov models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '92","pdfPath":"/iel2/617/5226/00202398.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"488 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '92","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1992.202398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1992.202398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=202398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo-continuous hidden Markov modeling for automatic speech recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Automatic speech recognition","Sampling methods","Speech recognition","Speech processing","Signal processing","Delay","Markov processes","Discrete transforms","Linear predictive coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable sampling rates","framing artifacts","speech parameters","hidden Markov model","speech recognition","short duration cues","framing effect","state transitions","pseudo-continuous transitions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-continuous hidden Markov modeling for automatic speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4314953","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-continuous hidden Markov modeling for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Birmingham, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"00202398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036503S","chronDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","isNumber":"5226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"617","articleId":"202398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":202408,"authors":[{"name":"H.

An example feeder is analyzed to display the advantage of the worst-case approach over conventional fixed load analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1992.202408","startPage":"530","endPage":"533 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '92","pdfPath":"/iel2/617/5226/00202408.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Southeastcon '92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1992.202408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst-case analysis of distribution system harmonics using genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Power harmonic filters","Capacitors","Harmonic distortion","Voltage","Magnetic analysis","Equations","IEEE members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","harmonics","load (electric)","optimisation","power capacitors","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","power factor correction","reactive power","distribution system harmonics","genetic algorithms","filters","loads","compensating capacitors","worst-case analysis","optimization","voltage harmonic distortion","feeder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Worst-case analysis of distribution system harmonics using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 April 1992","accessionNumber":"4314963","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst-case analysis of distribution system harmonics using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Birmingham, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"00202408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046446S","chronDate":"12-15 Apr 1992","isNumber":"5226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"617","citationCount":"3","articleId":"202408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":202707,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

This method involved the recursive evaluation of a discrete convolution, and was therefore relatively efficient. In this work, the recursive convolution approach is extended to media with dispersions described by multiple second-order poles. The significant change from the first-order implementation is that the single backstore variable for each second-order pole is complex. The approach is demonstrated for a pulsed plane wave incident on a medium with a complex permittivity described by two second-order poles, and excellent agreement is obtained with the exact solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.202707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5231/00202707.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.202707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD for Nth-order dispersive media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=202707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202707/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD for Nth-order dispersive media","volume":"40","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4400985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD for Nth-order dispersive media","sourcePdf":"00202707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026234S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"5231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"259","articleId":"202707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":202711,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The effects of eigenspace disturbance caused by finite samples on the output interference and noise powers are examined under the unit gain constraint in the direction of the desired signal. The results show that the performance of the DMI method is degraded mostly by the disturbed noise subspace. That suggests the use of an eigenspace-based beamformer in which the weight vector is computed by using the signal-plus-interference subspace component of the sample correlation matrix. Convergence properties of the eigenspace-based beamformer are evaluated for the cases in which the source number is known and in which it is overestimated. Theoretical analyses validated by computer simulations indicate that the eigenspace-based beamformer has faster convergence rate than the DMI method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.202711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.202711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5231/00202711.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of DMI and eigenspace-based beamformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance of DMI and eigenspace-based beamformers","volume":"40","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4400989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202711/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of DMI and eigenspace-based beamformers","sourcePdf":"00202711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026374S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"5231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"213","articleId":"202711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":202712,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The method utilizes the near-field data to determine equivalent magnetic current sources over a fictitious planar surface that encompasses the antenna, and these currents are used to ascertain the far fields. Under certain approximations, the currents should produce the correct far fields in all regions in front of the antenna regardless of the geometry over which the near-field measurements are made. An electric field integral equation (EFIE) is developed to relate the near fields to the equivalent magnetic currents. The method of moments is used to transform the integral equation into a matrix one. The matrix equation is solved with the conjugate gradient method, and in the case of a rectangular matrix, a least-squares solution for the currents is found without explicitly computing the normal form of the equation. Near-field to far-field transformation for planar scanning may be efficiently performed under certain conditions. Numerical results are presented for several antenna configurations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planar near-field to far-field transformation using an equivalent magnetic current approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.202712","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/5231/00202712.pdf","startPage":"1348","endPage":"1356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.202712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=202712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Planar near-field to far-field transformation using an equivalent magnetic current approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4400990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar near-field to far-field transformation using an equivalent magnetic current approach","sourcePdf":"00202712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029812S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"5231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"173","articleId":"202712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":202717,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

It is emphasized that the floating-gate technique is an attractive tool for characterizing the oxide traps located in the drain-gate overlap region, near the oxide spacer of the LDD structures. This work gives new insight into the creation of acceptorlike oxide traps which are electrically active only after electron injection phases. These defects are generated in the whole stress gate bias range (from V/sub d//8 to V/sub d/) by hot-hole and/or hot-electron injections, and their generation rates (10/sup -9/ and 10/sup -2/ for electron and hole injections, respectively) are one decade greater than for the interface state generation. Two-dimensional simulations show that they are mainly responsible for the I/sub d/-V/sub g/ degradation of the LDD MOSFETs, and that the trap concentrations deduced from charge-pumping experiments are consistent with the I/sub d/-V/sub g/ degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","accessionNumber":"4401031","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A coupled study by floating-gate and charge-pumping techniques of hot carrier-induced defects in submicrometer LDD n-MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coupled study by floating-gate and charge-pumping techniques of hot carrier-induced defects in submicrometer LDD n-MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00202790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046532S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"202790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":202798,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The two-channel case is studied in detail. The rules for finding inverses of a given coding network and the relationship between matched networks for one-channel decoding and two-channel inverse decoding are given. Phase and frequency differences among stations imply that unwanted signals add up incoherently. The ideal two-channel network with inverse decoding has no loss due to encoding/decoding, only inevitable loss due to the broadcast network.

At the transmitter the optical field is polarization modulated by a standard modulator. The receiver is based on the estimation of the Stokes parameters of the received optical field by means of a direct-detection optical front end and baseband electrical processing. The Poincare sphere rotation induced by the fiber is compensated by means of a purely electronic algorithm and the decision is performed in the Stokes space. The system performance is evaluated by an analytical model when the only relevant noise source is the receiver thermal noise and when erbium-doped optical amplifiers introduce amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise. The system is completely compatible with a direct-detection-based optical network, and it is possible to implement efficient multilevel modulation formats.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.202809","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1997","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/5234/00202809.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.202809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization modulated direct detection optical transmission systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","Optical polarization","Optical detectors","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Optical noise","Optical fiber polarization","Stokes parameters","Baseband","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light polarisation","optical links","optical modulation","random noise","superradiance","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PM-DD optical transmission systems","binary transmission","ASE noise","Er doped optical amplifiers","polarization modulated direct detection","multilevel transmission","transmitter","optical field","receiver","Stokes parameters","optical front end","baseband electrical processing","Poincare sphere rotation","fiber","electronic algorithm","Stokes space","analytical model","noise source","thermal noise","amplified spontaneous emission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Polarization modulated direct detection optical transmission systems","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4404368","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202809/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization modulated direct detection optical transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00202809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035005S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"55","articleId":"202809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":202817,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The small polarization dependence of the modulator is essential for inline use. By utilizing the monotonic increase of the extinction ratio with increasing applied voltage, the electroabsorption modulator driven by a large-signal sinusoidal voltage can produce a time domain square-shaped gate function with variable gate width. Furthermore, amplified spontaneous emission noise of optical amplifier systems can be reduced in both time and wavelength domains at the off-state of the modulator, due to noninterferometric wide wavelength operation of the modulator.

General formulas describing the gain degradation as a function of IhCU rate are obtained by solving rate equations for population probabilities in the relevant Er/sup 3+/ energy levels. The experimental results, such as low gain for high Er/sup 3+/ concentration, and higher saturated gain with counterpropagation than with copropagation pumping, which have not yet been explained theoretically, are qualitatively explained by this model. Good agreement between the measured and calculated gain is obtained. The gain degradation characteristics at 1.48- and 0.98- mu m pump wavelengths are analyzed with this model. The advantage of counterpropagation pumping is determined qualitatively. The noise figure degradation is also evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Gain measurement","Wavelength measurement","Optical fibers","Optical fiber amplifiers","Noise figure","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","laser theory","optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EDFA","Er-doped fibre amplifiers","laser pumping","counterpropagation pumping","gain degradation","high concentration","erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","inhomogeneous cooperative up-conversion","pump wavelengths","low gain","saturated gain","copropagation pumping","noise figure degradation","1.48 micron","0.98 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.202830","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/5234/00202830.pdf","startPage":"1789","endPage":"1799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.202830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the gain degradation of high concentration erbium-doped fiber amplifiers by introducing inhomogeneous cooperative up-conversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=202830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the gain degradation of high concentration erbium-doped fiber amplifiers by introducing inhomogeneous cooperative up-conversion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/202830/","volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4404343","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the gain degradation of high concentration erbium-doped fiber amplifiers by introducing inhomogeneous cooperative up-conversion","sourcePdf":"00202830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031848S","chronDate":"Dec.  1992","isNumber":"5234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","articleId":"202830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":202837,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

Two schemes of phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement have been investigated. In the first scheme, PMUs are used as pilot points for the secondary voltage control of a power system. Several criteria for pilot point selections are reviewed and assessed. In the second scheme, the PMUs are used for the purpose of estimating the whole state of the system. This is a prerequisite for the determination of the voltage stability margins. The goal is to find the minimal set of PMUs that makes the system both linear and observable. By making use of the simulated annealing method, an algorithm which achieves this goal has been developed and tested on several power systems of various sizes and structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00203341.pdf","startPage":"3033","endPage":"3038 vol.6","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.203341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.203341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=203341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phasor measurement placement for voltage stability analysis of power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Stability analysis","Phasor measurement units","Power system stability","Power system analysis computing","Power system measurements","Power system simulation","Real time systems","Power measurement","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","stability","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phasor measurement unit placement","voltage stability analysis","power systems","real-time phasor measurements","secondary voltage control","simulated annealing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/203341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Phasor measurement placement for voltage stability analysis of power systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4050337","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phasor measurement placement for voltage stability analysis of power systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00203341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051206S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"46","articleId":"203341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":203395,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The convergence properties of the neural networks are provided by the averaged equation and Lyapunov method. Simulation results on this learning approach are presented.

Although the nonlinear adaptive control of this problem can fit into a general framework, a representation of the torque-ripple which reduces the number of adapted parameters per torque-ripple harmonic by half is used. By doing so, it is possible to prove conditions on exogenous signals to guarantee the persistency of excitation of the regressor, and hence the exponential stability of the unperturbed system. It is shown that the adaptive system is robust to a class of state- and parameter-dependent modeling errors and disturbances even when the adaptation gain and convergence rate of the unperturbed system become small. The adapted parameter errors are proved to converge to a neighborhood of zero whose radius can be made small by slow adaptation. The proposed control scheme is verified in an experiment in which a 32-dB reduction in torque-ripple component at the rotor pole frequency is observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.203409","startPage":"3319","endPage":"3324 vol.6","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.203409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00203409.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive torque-ripple cancellation for step motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/203409/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive torque-ripple cancellation for step motors","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4055177","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear adaptive torque-ripple cancellation for step motors","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00203409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036637S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"56","articleId":"203409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":203417,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

This controller uses a relaxed terminal constraint x(T) in W (where W is some neighborhood of the origin). Since the terminal constraint is relaxed, the receding horizon strategy loses its stabilizing properties inside W. To compensate for this effect, a linear, locally stabilizing controller designed for the linearized system is used inside W. The resulting concatenated control action yields a controller which is shown to be globally stabilizing.

The clutter is modeled spatially as a first-order Markov Gaussian process, while the target return is assumed to be Rayleigh envelope distributed. The case where the clutter power is much higher than the thermal noise power is considered. An expression for the probability of false alarm of the CA-CFAR (cell-averaging-CFAR) detector is derived. In the analysis, the covariance matrix of the total noise (thermal noise plus clutter) is approximated by the covariance matrix of the clutter. It is shown that the CFAR parameters of the CA-CFAR detector are dependent on the clutter covariance matrix and that the achieved probability of false alarm may be degraded up to five orders of magnitude when the degree of correlation of the clutter samples is high.

Blind adaptive algorithms are recursive identification schemes used in communication systems, and are often designed via gradient descent minimization of certain memoryless, non-MSE (mean square error) continuous cost functions. It is shown that for these cost functions, there generally exist local minima that do not correspond to the ideal plant inverse identification once the algorithm has converged. The authors demonstrate the general nonglobality of gradient descent blind algorithms and the need for initialization within the regions of attractions of the desired minima in order to achieve the objective of successful identification. Furthermore, it is shown that global convergence in the total (channel plus equalizer) parameter space does not necessarily imply the same behavior in finite equalizer parameter space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.203586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.203586","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00203586.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"230 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/203586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Nonglobal convergence of blind recursive identifiers based on gradient descent of continuous cost functions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"4030249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonglobal convergence of blind recursive identifiers based on gradient descent of continuous cost functions","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00203586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045557S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"4","articleId":"203586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":203590,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

An explicit open loop control is then given which transfers the knife edge to a single equilibrium and an explicit stabilizing feedback control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00203820.pdf","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1314 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.203820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.203820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controllability and stabilizability properties of a nonholonomic control system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/203820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Controllability and stabilizability properties of a nonholonomic control system","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4011571","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controllability and stabilizability properties of a nonholonomic control system","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00203820.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02606S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"84","articleId":"203820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":203904,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

As a result, the approach makes it possible to introduce such time-invariant concepts as transfer functions, poles, and zeros even in the presence of the intersample behavior.

A describing function analysis of the effect of the nonlinearity due to nonuniform quantization is presented.

In this approach, a continuous-valued covariance, which is a function of a discrete-valued random variable, is used to characterize the tracking errors in an average sense. This covariance can be calculated offline recursively from a modified Riccati equation, which can be obtained by replacing the measurement-dependent terms in the original stochastic equation with their conditional expected values. This approach has the merit of yielding a quantification of the transients of tracking divergence, as well as better accuracy than previous work. Such an approach is particularly suitable for stability studies of tracking filters. In addition, a quantitative study of the track life problem is conducted, in which the number of validated measurements play a central role.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.204027","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00204027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.204027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","startPage":"2264","endPage":"2269 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability evaluation and track life of the PDAF for tracking in clutter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=204027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability evaluation and track life of the PDAF for tracking in clutter","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204027/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4038977","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability evaluation and track life of the PDAF for tracking in clutter","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00204027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054741S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"2","articleId":"204027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":204050,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The use of connectionist systems as learning controllers is proposed. The ability of connectionist systems to approximate arbitrary continuous functions (e.g., control laws) overcomes the usual memory-intensive nature of learning systems. The backpropagation algorithm is extended to allow the connectionist system to learn to function as a closed-loop controller and to force the dynamics of the closed-loop system to match the prespecified dynamics of a reference system. An example of the application of this algorithm to the depth control of an autonomous underwater vehicle is included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.204050","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00204050.pdf","startPage":"2362","endPage":"2367 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.204050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectionist learning control systems: submarine depth control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=204050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204050/","displayDocTitle":"Connectionist learning control systems: submarine depth control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4045843","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectionist learning control systems: submarine depth control","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00204050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033946S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"15","articleId":"204050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":204073,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Multiscale representations, including wavelet transforms, homogeneous trees, shift operations, and transfer functions, are discussed. It is shown that the homogeneous tree possesses strange geometric properties that have the following consequence: the double role played by the classical z-transform, namely, encoding transfer function and defining stationarity, is split between two different objects-the shifts to encode transfer functions (these are not isometries) and the translations to define stationarity (these are not easily expressed by shifts). Two system theories are sketched that emphasize each of these two different objects. Finally, a notion of stationary stochastic processes is introduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1990.204073","publicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"29th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/164/5238/00204073.pdf","startPage":"2484","endPage":"2489 vol.4","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1990.204073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale system theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale system theory","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4045866","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204073/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale system theory","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00204073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035813S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"164","citationCount":"25","articleId":"204073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":204089,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An efficient induction method is developed for learning quantitative rules in relational databases. With the assistance of knowledge about concept hierarchies, data relevance, and expected rule forms, attribute-oriented induction can be performed on the database, which integrates database operations with the learning process and provides a simple, efficient way of learning quantitative rules from large databases. The method involves the learning of both characteristic rules and classification rules. Quantitative information facilitates quantitative reasoning, incremental learning, and learning in the presence of noise. Moreover, learning qualitative rules can be treated as a special case of learning quantitative rules. It is shown that attribute-oriented induction provides an efficient and effective mechanism for learning various kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.204089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/5239/00204089.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"40","doi":"10.1109/69.204089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven discovery of quantitative rules in relational databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven discovery of quantitative rules in relational databases","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4406024","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven discovery of quantitative rules in relational databases","sourcePdf":"00204089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075196S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"223","articleId":"204089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":204094,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Unlike schemes which simply prefetch the next sector or group of sectors, this method maintains information about the order of past disk accesses which is used to accurately predict future access sequences. The range of parameters of this scheme is explored, and its performance is evaluated through trace-driven simulation, using traces obtained from three different UNIX minicomputers. Unlike disk trace data previously described in the literature, the traces used include time stamps for each reference. With this timing information-essential for evaluating any prefetching scheme-it is shown that a cache with the adaptive prefetching mechanism can reduce the average time to service a disk request by a factor of up to three, relative to an identical disk cache without prefetching.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4406029","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Multiple prefetch adaptive disk caching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple prefetch adaptive disk caching","sourcePdf":"00204094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033409S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"27","articleId":"204094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":204098,"authors":[{"name":"B.W.

The algorithm always yields exact zero skew trees with respect to the appropriate delay model. Experimental results show an 8% to 15% wire length reduction over some previous constructions. The DME algorithm may be applied to either the Elmore or linear delay model, and yields optimal total wirelength for linear delay. DME is a very fast algorithm, running in time linear in the number of synchronizing elements. A unified BB+DME algorithm, which constructs a clock tree topology using a top-down balanced bipartition (BB) approach and then applies DME to that topology, is also presented.

Mathematical techniques and heuristics based on Lagrangian relaxation are used to find an approximate solution to the constrained problem.

The router, named SLICE, is independent of net ordering, requires much shorter computation time, and uses fewer vias. A key step is to compute a maximum noncrossing bipartite matching, which is solved optimally in O(n log n) time where n is the number of possible connections. The router was tested on a number of examples, including two MCM designs from MCC. The total wirelength used by SLICE is only a few percent away from the optimal on average. Compared with a 3-D maze router, SLICE is six times faster and uses 29% fewer vias. Another feature of SLICE is that it works on only a 'thin slice' of a two-layer routing grid at a time, so it can produce solutions for large MCM routing examples where 3-D maze routers fail due to insufficient memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.204131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/5241/00204131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.204131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5241","startPage":"841","endPage":"851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast multilayer general area router for MCM designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=204131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast multilayer general area router for MCM designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4416265","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast multilayer general area router for MCM designs","sourcePdf":"00204131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074324S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"5241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"10","articleId":"204131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":204177,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

An implicit finite difference (IFD) scheme to solve the SPE is applied between the irregularly shaped ground and an altitude z=z/sub h/, below which all inhomogeneities of the medium are assumed localized. The boundary condition at z=z/sub h/ is obtained by matching the IFD solution to a surface Green's function (SGF) solution within the uniform region above z=z/sub h/. For ground slopes above about 1 degrees , the IFD implementation of the impedance boundary condition at the ground is shown to maintain the validity of the approximation only for vertically polarized waves.

In this approach, the first constraint is dedicated to the imposition of a desired quiescent response, and additional constraints are included to assure proper reception of the desired signal. These additional constraints make the overall beamformer response equal to the quiescent response in the desired signal region so that the signal is not cancelled when it is present. Optionally, the response can be fixed in other regions of interest by adding more constraints. This design procedure demonstrates that the key to designing efficient constraints is finding the weighting coefficients which specify the desired quiescent response, a problem identical to the synthesis of desired beam patterns for nonadaptive arrays.

The recording of action potentials is then simulated with the general-purpose network-analysis program SPICE. Both noble-metal microelectrodes and insulated-gate FETs are considered. The responses of such devices are characterized as functions of several parameters, e.g. sealing impedance, density of ionic currents in the cell membrane, and spatial discontinuities of the adhesion process. It is shown that the various signal shapes reported in the literature can be reproduced and interpreted in terms of time derivatives of the action potential. In this way, the shape of any experimental signal can be interpreted on the basis of a specific sealing condition.

It is shown that the myoelectric signal exhibits a deterministic structure during the initial phase of a muscle contraction. Features are extracted from several time segments of the myoelectric signal to preserve pattern structure. These features are then classified using an artificial neural network. The control signals are derived from natural contraction patterns which can be produced reliably with little subject training. The new control scheme increases the number of functions which can be controlled by a single channel of myoelectric signal but does so in a way which does not increase the effort required by the amputee. Results are presented to support this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.204774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.204774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5248/00204774.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new strategy for multifunction myoelectric control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","displayDocTitle":"A new strategy for multifunction myoelectric control","volume":"40","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4424312","pubMedId":"8468080","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204774/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new strategy for multifunction myoelectric control","sourcePdf":"204774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102731S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"5248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"1249","articleId":"204774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":204786,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method, called the branching CORDIC method, consists of performing in parallel two classic CORDIC rotations. It gives a constant normalization factor.

An energy function which contains the constraints and cost criteria of an optimization problem is derived, and then the neural network is used to find the global minimum (or maximum) of the energy function, which corresponds to a solution of the optimization problem. The network contains two subnets: a constraint network and a goal network. The constraint network models the constraints of an optimization problem and computes the gradient (updating) value of each neuron such that the energy function monotonically converges to satisfy all constraints of the problem. The goal network points out the direction of convergence for finding an optimal value for the cost criteria. These two subnets ensure that the neural network finds feasible as well as optimal (or near-optimal) solutions.

The major experimental finding is that the pulse discharges often propagate to nearby mutually biased electrodes and can create a full vacuum breakdown between stainless steel electrodes, rarely if biased at as little as 100 V, but often if biased at 300 V. The phenomena appear to be associated with the pulsed creation of dense plasma from the discharging dielectric, and the pulsed volume of gas evolved is equivalent to roughly 0.1 to 0.4 mm/sup 3/ at 1 atm for nominally 50-cm/sup 2/ samples. The plasma could evolve to interconnect more than two electrodes. Additionally, PET pulse rates were strongly dependent upon the proximity of sharp edges, either metallic or dielectric.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4374562","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-induced electrical discharges in complex structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-induced electrical discharges in complex structures","sourcePdf":"00204868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037267S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"5251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"30","articleId":"204868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":204872,"authors":[{"name":"I.W.

The decay of such charges due to surface currents at the void wall is studied analytically, and the factors affecting this decay are indicated. The results show that in terms of the basic time constant, the decay can take a considerable amount of time. The decay rate is significantly reduced by an increase in the permittivity of the bulk medium. The dominating influence of this permittivity is likewise reflected in the increased duration and thereby prolonged inhomogeneity of the electric field sustained in the void. However, the absolute value of this field is reduced with an increase in bulk permittivity. It is concluded that the present choice of a point charge to simulate the wall charge has the disadvantage that such a source is associated with a field singularity, and thus it is not possible to represent the maximum field at the void wall in a realistic manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/204872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4374566","displayDocTitle":"Decay of charge deposited on the wall of gaseous void","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decay of charge deposited on the wall of gaseous void","sourcePdf":"00204872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029421S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"5251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"33","articleId":"204872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":204967,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

To illustrate the practical significance of this work, it is shown how the density values at internal nodes can be used to study circuit reliability by estimating the average power and ground currents; the average power dissipation; the susceptibility to electromigration failures; and the extent of hot-electron degradation.

Synthesizing a sequential circuit from a state-transition-graph description involves the steps of state minimization, state assignment, and logic optimization. It is also shown that 100% testability can be ensured without the addition of extra logic and without constraints on the state assignment and logic optimization. There is no area/performance penalty associated with this approach. This technique can be used in conjunction with previous approaches to ensure that the synthesized machine is easily testable. Given a state-transition-graph specification, a logic-level automation that is fully testable for all single stuck-at faults in the combinational logic without access to the memory elements can be synthesized.

The aspects modeled concern operational strategies encountered in the application environment.

A key feature of the methodology is that it supports traceability of the information contained in the architectural design. The specification resulting from the application of the methodology can be mapped to a top-level object-based modular architecture.

Single-user demodulation based on a conditionally compound-Poisson observation has been considered, focusing on the special case of prime codes, equal energies, and utility-gain photodetectors. It has been found that the approximation of perfect optical-to-electrical conversion yields poor estimates of the error rate and optimal threshold at moderate incident optical intensities and dark currents.

The results of theoretical and experimental studies evaluating the use of pulse sequences for code-division multiple accessing for networking, data distribution, and various applications are summarized.

One study has shown that the phase noise effect depends on the source linewidth, the accuracy of the correlator design, and the sequence pulse widths and that the latter should be about 3-5 times the laser coherence time. Electronic correlators avoid the phase noise problem and are generally superior to optical correlators provided accurate bit timing is maintained and the data rates are not excessive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3956992","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 1990","displayDocTitle":"Pulse combining and time-space coding for multiple accessing with fiber arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse combining and time-space coding for multiple accessing with fiber arrays","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00205431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02326S","chronDate":"25-27 July 1990","isNumber":"5265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"175","citationCount":"12","articleId":"205431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":205433,"authors":[{"name":"Y.L.

The new codes corresponding to the ladder networks are named the 2/sup n/ codes, since the peak power reduction factor P=2/sup n/, where (n+1) is the number of couplers. They are quite different from the prime codes in their temporal structures: for example, only symmetric pulse patterns are allowed. A standard signal-to-noise analysis for the simplest class of possible codes (orthogonal) shows that the 2/sup n/ codes are quite comparable to the prime codes, in that comparable BERs with code sequences of approximately the same length, and similar numbers of possible codes to accommodate the users, are obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OMAN.1990.205433","publicationTitle":"LEOS Summer Topical on Optical Multiple Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"LEOS Summer Topical on Optical Multiple Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/175/5265/00205433.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"50","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00205433.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OMAN.1990.205433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2/sup n/ codes for optical CDMA and associated networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205433/","displayDocTitle":"2/sup n/ codes for optical CDMA and associated networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3956994","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2/sup n/ codes for optical CDMA and associated networks","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00205433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035982S","chronDate":"25-27 July 1990","isNumber":"5265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"175","citationCount":"4","articleId":"205433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":205472,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The original scheme of Papoulis and Chamzas (1979) serves as a model for the remaining algorithms. After a review and evaluation of their method, more direct approaches which require less iterations and perform better are then developed by considering adaptive algorithms which produce exact extrapolations at each step. Adaptive conventional bandlimited extrapolation is shown to provide good results in a much smaller number of iterations. Adaptive weighted norm extrapolation which incorporates a spectrum estimation step, rather than thresholding, is then shown to provide almost exact results in the absence of noise. A brief comparison with the principal component linear prediction method is included. The ability to incorporate a priori knowledge about the frequency locations is provided and the potential benefits of its use are briefly illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SPECT.1990.205541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPECT.1990.205541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5268","startPage":"35","endPage":"39","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth ASSP Workshop on Spectrum Estimation and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel2/182/5268/00205541.pdf","publicationTitle":"Fifth ASSP Workshop on Spectrum Estimation and Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205541","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Extrapolation","Frequency estimation","Additive noise","Narrowband","Frequency domain analysis","Chaos","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy","State estimation","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation","parameter estimation","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sinusoid frequency estimation","signal processing","spectral analysis","adaptive minimum norm extrapolation","iterations","adaptive algorithms","conventional bandlimited extrapolation","spectrum estimation step","principal component linear prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of sinusoids by adaptive minimum norm extrapolation","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4022954","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205541/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of sinusoids by adaptive minimum norm extrapolation","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00205541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04962S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"5268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"182","citationCount":"5","articleId":"205541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":205554,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

Examples show that use of beamspace MUSIC with the identified beamformers can produce lower resolution thresholds, biases and variances than a variety of other eigenvector approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SPECT.1990.205564","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth ASSP Workshop on Spectrum Estimation and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel2/182/5268/00205564.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPECT.1990.205564","publicationTitle":"Fifth ASSP Workshop on Spectrum Estimation and Modeling","startPage":"149","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamformer preprocessing for enhanced resolution by the MUSIC algorithm (preview)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","displayDocTitle":"Beamformer preprocessing for enhanced resolution by the MUSIC algorithm (preview)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205564/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4022977","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamformer preprocessing for enhanced resolution by the MUSIC algorithm (preview)","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00205564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025465S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"5268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"182","citationCount":"5","articleId":"205564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":205571,"authors":[{"name":"B.

By expanding upon the conventional (fixed-windowed) spectrogram, the VWS provides flexible time-frequency localizations depending on the selection of the variable (i.e., time- and frequency-dependent) windows. It is shown that the VWS is a subclass of Cohen's class and that a particular constraint on the window of the VWS produces a distribution which is equivalent to the modulus squared of a WT. Some aspects of the VWS are discussed in the ambiguity, temporal correlation, spectral correlation, and time-frequency domains.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth ASSP Workshop on Spectrum Estimation and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel2/182/5268/00205589.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"Fifth ASSP Workshop on Spectrum Estimation and Modeling","doi":"10.1109/SPECT.1990.205589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPECT.1990.205589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-windowed spectrograms: connecting Cohen's class and the wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectrogram","Joining processes","Wavelet transforms","Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms","Kernel","Computer science","Signal representations","Signal analysis","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","spectral analysis","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed time-frequency signal representation","time-frequency representations","variable-windowed spectrograms","Cohen's class","wavelet transform","ambiguity","temporal correlation","spectral correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","displayDocTitle":"Variable-windowed spectrograms: connecting Cohen's class and the wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4023003","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-windowed spectrograms: connecting Cohen's class and the wavelet transform","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00205589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028665S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"5268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"182","citationCount":"10","articleId":"205589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":205594,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

Photoconductive switches on the probe tip define stimulus pulses and sampling intervals, and signals are transferred to and from the wafer under test by coplanar waveguide transmission lines and plated contact bumps. Vector error correction eliminates the need for time gating to separate the input and reflected pulses, while enhancing accuracy. Since probe flexure under contact significantly disturbs alignment of free-space beams, fiber-optic input yields the most precise measurements. The authors demonstrate calibrated, on-wafer measurements of the complex reflection coefficient S/sub 11/ at frequencies up to 100 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Photoconductivity","Sampling methods","Transmission line measurements","Optical fiber testing","Error correction","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave measurements","Switches","Coplanar waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre optic sensors","integrated circuit testing","integrated optoelectronics","microwave measurement","optical switches","photoconducting devices","semiconductor switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space input","photoconductive switches","vector error correction","calibrated measurements","photoconductive sampling","optoelectronic wafer probes","fiber-optic input","microwave error correction techniques","probe tip","stimulus pulses","sampling intervals","coplanar waveguide transmission lines","plated contact bumps","reflected pulses","probe flexure","free-space beams","on-wafer measurements","complex reflection coefficient","100 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.205639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/5269/00205639.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.205639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"100 GHz wafer probes based on photoconductive sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"100 GHz wafer probes based on photoconductive sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205639/","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4430439","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"100 GHz wafer probes based on photoconductive sampling","sourcePdf":"00205639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032092S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"6","articleId":"205639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":205649,"authors":[{"name":"W.-J.

The proposed algorithm adds an extra, low-cost scheduling phase to the usual sort, transfer, and join phases. During the scheduling phase, a parallelizable optimization algorithm, using the output of the sort phase, attempts to balance the load across the multiple processors in the subsequent join phase. The algorithm naturally identifies the largest skew elements, and assigns each of them to an optimal number of processors. Assuming a Zipf-like distribution of data skew, the algorithm is demonstrated to achieve very good load balancing for the join phase, and is shown to be very robust relative, among other things, to the degree of data skew and the total number of processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/5270/00205654.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"86","doi":"10.1109/71.205654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.205654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel sort merge join algorithm for managing data skew","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"A parallel sort merge join algorithm for managing data skew","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4398002","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel sort merge join algorithm for managing data skew","sourcePdf":"00205654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051559S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"5270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"24","articleId":"205654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":205665,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

The output of these filters is determined by comparing a lower- and an upper-order statistic to the middle sample in the filter window. These filters can be designed for smoothing and sharpening, or outlier rejection. The level of smoothing done by the filter can range from no smoothing to that of the median filter. This flexibility allows the LUM filter to be designed to best balance the tradeoffs between noise smoothing and signal detail preservation. LUM filters for enhancing edge gradients can be designed to be insensitive to low levels of additive noise and to remove impulsive noise. Furthermore, LUM filters do not cause overshoot or undershoot. Some statistical and deterministic properties of the LUM filters are developed, and a number of experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance. These experiments include applications to 1D signals and to images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4440624","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"LUM filters: a class of rank-order-based filters for smoothing and sharpening","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LUM filters: a class of rank-order-based filters for smoothing and sharpening","sourcePdf":"00205713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041443S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"130","articleId":"205713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":205714,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

The two problems of determining whether the length of the input sequence or the length of the output sequence is reduced can be found to be duals of each other, and the same methods can, to a large extent, be used to solve both. The algorithms utilize the redundancy in the input or output to reduce the number of operations below those of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. The usual pruning method is discussed, and an efficient algorithm, called transform decomposition, is introduced. It is based on a mixture of a standard FFT algorithm and the Horner polynomial evaluation scheme equivalent to the one in Goertzel's algorithms. It requires fewer operations and is more flexible than pruning. The algorithm works for power-of-two and prime-factor algorithms, as well as for real-input data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.205723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.205723","endPage":"1200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5272/00205723.pdf","startPage":"1184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient computation of the DFT with only a subset of input or output points","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205723/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient computation of the DFT with only a subset of input or output points","volume":"41","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4440634","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient computation of the DFT with only a subset of input or output points","sourcePdf":"00205723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036236S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"157","articleId":"205723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":205725,"authors":[{"name":"Y.Y.

A nonuniform sampling theorem (Clark et al, 1985) for functions belonging to this space is extended, and a class of nonstationary stochastic processes is considered. The space of locally bandlimited signals is shown to be a reproducing-kernel space. A generalized projection theorem can therefore be applied, yielding either a continuous or a discrete projection filter. The former can be used for image conditioning prior to nonuniform sampling, while the latter provides a general tool for image representation by nonuniform sampling schemes. The problem of finding the local bandwidth of a given signal, in order to generate an optimal sampling scheme, is addressed in the context of signal representation in the combined position-frequency space. The stochastic estimation of parameters which characterize the local bandwidth is discussed. Bounds on the error resulting from the utilization of nonexact position-varying signal parameters are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4440636","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform sampling and antialiasing in image representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform sampling and antialiasing in image representation","sourcePdf":"00205725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079189S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"205725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":205728,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

The result is a partitioned systolic array with Q processors (Q=r/sup i/, 0<or=i<n), which extracts the maximum spatial and temporal parallelism achieved by the successive doubling algorithm and can be integrated in VLSI and WSI technologies.<<ETX>>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.205761","doi":"10.1109/78.205761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/5272/00205761.pdf","startPage":"1476","endPage":"1481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-specific architecture for fast transforms based on the successive doubling method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application-specific architecture for fast transforms based on the successive doubling method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4440659","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-specific architecture for fast transforms based on the successive doubling method","sourcePdf":"00205761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043716S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"205761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":205811,"authors":[{"name":"H.

While the discrete-time scheme involves a fundamental unit of time (viz. the sampling period of the signal) that determines both the duration of the delay and the rate of gain-updating, the new continuous-time scheme involves a delay of arbitrary duration and continuously varying gains.

No particular VLSI knowledge is needed and, therefore, the exercise demonstrates that Tangram allows system designers to design VLSI circuits. The exercise also shows that in a VLSI programming language special language constructs are essential to obtain efficient designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Very large scale integration","Circuits","Computer languages","Algorithm design and analysis","Cost function","Concurrent computing","Encoding","Laboratories","Functional programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction","Hi-Fi equipment","programming languages","specification languages","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed Solomon codes","VLSI programming","VLSI design","Tangram","error decoding","Compact Disc player","architectural considerations","VLSI knowledge","VLSI programming language","language constructs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1992.205896","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings The European Conference on Design Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings The European Conference on Design Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/391/5276/00205896.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1992.205896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An error decoder for the Compact Disc player as an example of VLSI programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An error decoder for the Compact Disc player as an example of VLSI programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205896/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4303680","conferenceDate":"16-19 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An error decoder for the Compact Disc player as an example of VLSI programming","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00205896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029901S","chronDate":"16-19 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"391","citationCount":"16","articleId":"205896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":205926,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, in practice it is rather difficult for end users (i.e. circuit designers) to understand these primitives, let alone interact with them directly. Unfortunately, existing systems assume that it is the user's responsibility to explicitly build up the meta-data, by which is meant attribute and relationship information. This paper presents a novel incremental meta-data construction paradigm, which is based on (1) a structured design history model, and (2) the specifications of tool-specific execution semantics. Using this paradigm, the authors design and implement algorithms that automatically establish per-object attributes and inter-object relationships as a side effect of CAD tool execution. Consequently the rich modeling capability of an object-oriented database can be fully exploited in a design environment without circuit designers' participation in meta-data construction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1992.205964","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings The European Conference on Design Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings The European Conference on Design Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/391/5276/00205964.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1992.205964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental meta-data construction for VLSI design databases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=205964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205964/","displayDocTitle":"Incremental meta-data construction for VLSI design databases","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4291993","conferenceDate":"16-19 March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental meta-data construction for VLSI design databases","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00205964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048907S","chronDate":"16-19 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"391","citationCount":"1","articleId":"205964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":205966,"authors":[{"name":"Tzi-Cker Chiueh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tzi-Cker Chiueh","id":"37273336700"},{"name":"R.H.

Unlike other synthesis programs, it searches in an extremely large set of possible circuits (over 1,000,000 configurations), and is not restricted to one device technology. To ensure a high rate of success in the designs, it uses mathematically sound search rules instead of heuristic ones, and accurate approximations of the circuit behavior.

This approach uses a sample layout, the template, to graphically capture an expert's knowledge of analog device placement and routing for a given module type. To generate a module, one supplies the required electrical parameters for each device and a geometrical constraint on the module's shape e.g. a desired aspect ratio. Using exhaustive floorplan area optimisation techniques, the tool then determines the optimum shape of each device so as to satisfy the user's geometrical constraint. Subsequently, layout is generated by transforming (via compaction) the template into a module, substituting the devices in the template by newly generated devices with the user-supplied electrical parameters and the determined geometrical shapes. This technique produces good quality layout in reasonable amount of time, by availing of the expert designer knowledge embedded in the template and by taking analog specific features like device matching and merging into account during the layout transformation phase. This approach is illustrated using an n-type super MOS transistor circuit generator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1992.205989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1992.205989","startPage":"513","endPage":"519","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings The European Conference on Design Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/391/5276/00205989.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings The European Conference on Design Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automatic layout generator for analog circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"An automatic layout generator for analog circuits","conferenceDate":"16-19 March 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4292013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/205989/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automatic layout generator for analog circuits","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"00205989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040111S","chronDate":"16-19 Mar 1992","isNumber":"5276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"391","citationCount":"20","articleId":"205989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":206171,"authors":[{"name":"J.X.

Additionally, these methods allow a simple and more effective extension of the spatial Wigner-Ville approach to cases in which noise and/or multiple signals are present.

A technique to use the state knowledge of previously generated vectors for state justification, without the memory overhead of a state transition diagram is presented. For faults that were aborted during the standard test generation phase, knowledge that was gained about fault propagation, by the fault simulator, is used.

Upon construction of the waveguide terminating admittance expression from its variational form, an inverse problem is solved to extract the slab thickness form the conductance and susceptance in a recursive manner. A comparison between the experimental and theoretical results showed that the significance of higher order modes is minimal; hence, the dominant mode assumption is, in general, valid for describing the aperture field distribution. The validity of this assumption has led to the construction of a simple integral solution which is fast converging for generally lossy dielectric slabs, and may easily be implemented for real-time applications. Good agreement was obtained between the theoretical and experimental results. Multiple thicknesses of two different dielectric samples were estimated in this way.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.206673","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.206673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/5289/00206673.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-ended rectangular waveguide for nondestructive thickness measurement and variation detection of lossy dielectric slabs backed by a conducting plate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/206673/","displayDocTitle":"Open-ended rectangular waveguide for nondestructive thickness measurement and variation detection of lossy dielectric slabs backed by a conducting plate","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4414227","publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-ended rectangular waveguide for nondestructive thickness measurement and variation detection of lossy dielectric slabs backed by a conducting plate","sourcePdf":"00206673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027974S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"82","articleId":"206673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":206925,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It offers an attractive alternative to managing switching noise in single-chip or multichip packages. The CAC is a thin, flat capacitor, comparable in size to an IC die, that is placed on the active surface of the die and connected to on-chip power and ground pads through very short bonds. Environmental testing of the CAC process has been performed, indicating no device parameter degradation when attachment is made to the active surface of a passivated die. CAC design issues are addressed and the feasibility of manufacturing high-frequency capacitors and their assemblies using conventional reworkable or permanent attach processes is demonstrated. Examples of the integration of CACs in high-performance single-chip packages and in chips on multichip modules (MCMs) are shown, and the effectiveness of CACs in the reduction of switching noise is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/33.206931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/5292/00206931.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.206931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The close attached capacitor: a solution to switching noise problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=206931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/206931/","displayDocTitle":"The close attached capacitor: a solution to switching noise problems","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4419565","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The close attached capacitor: a solution to switching noise problems","sourcePdf":"00206931.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039529S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"5292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"9","articleId":"206931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":206956,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main result is that the expansion coefficients of the approximation are obtained by linear filtering and sampling. The authors apply those results to construct a L/sub 2/ polynomial spline pyramid that is a parametric multiresolution representation of a signal. This hierarchical data structure is generated by repeated application of a REDUCE function (prefilter and down-sampler). A complementary EXPAND function (up-sampler and post-filter) allows a finer resolution mapping of any coarser level of the pyramid. Four equivalent representations of this pyramid are considered, and the corresponding REDUCE and EXPAND filters are determined explicitly for polynomial splines of any order n (odd). Some image processing examples are presented. It is demonstrated that the performance of the Laplacian pyramid can be improved significantly by using a modified EXPAND function associated with the dual representation of a cubic spline pyramid.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.206956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5293","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00206956.png","startPage":"364","endPage":"379","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/5293/00206956.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.206956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The L/sub 2/-polynomial spline pyramid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spline","Signal resolution","Spatial resolution","Nonlinear filters","Polynomials","Wavelet transforms","Laplace equations","Image processing","Data structures","Multigrid methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","signal processing","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","signal approximation","parametric multiresolution signal representation","L/sub 2/-polynomial spline pyramid","linear filtering","hierarchical data structure","REDUCE function","prefilter","down-sampler","EXPAND function","up-sampler","post-filter","image processing","Laplacian pyramid","cubic spline pyramid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"The L/sub 2/-polynomial spline pyramid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/206956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"15","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4414402","publicationDate":"April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The L/sub 2/-polynomial spline pyramid","sourcePdf":"00206956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039152S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"102","articleId":"206956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":206958,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A procedure to extract discriminantly informative features based on a decision boundary is proposed. The proposed feature extraction algorithm has several desirable properties: (1) it predicts the minimum number of features necessary to achieve the same classification accuracy as in the original space for a given pattern recognition problem; and (2) it finds the necessary feature vectors. The proposed algorithm does not deteriorate under the circumstances of equal class means or equal class covariances as some previous algorithms do.

It is recommended that power system planning models should incorporate financial flows with the linear programming approach to capital budgeting originally formulated in 1963 by H.M. Weingartner. The need for such an approach is illustrated with examples of how capital market conditions can upset the type of engineering economic decision making currently used in planning models.

However, to reduce the conservatism inherent in all interval arithmetic computations, an iterative method used to obtain the hull of the solution set is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.207353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/5304/00207353.pdf","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.207353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interval arithmetic in power flow analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=207353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207353/","displayDocTitle":"Interval arithmetic in power flow analysis","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4242042","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interval arithmetic in power flow analysis","sourcePdf":"00207353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024806S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"5304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"197","articleId":"207353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":207362,"authors":[{"name":"C.

An expert system was used for obtaining the initial solution. As the generation scheduling problem involves unit commitment and economic dispatch, the method adopts an iterative procedure to deal with these two phases. The hourly load demand and the area power generation will cause the tie flows to change. To maintain the operation security in every area, the spinning reserve should comply with the area power generation rather than its load demand. After economic dispatch, it is necessary to adjust the unit commitment in each area for preserving the spinning reserve requirements. Heuristics were used to modify the generation unit combinations. The objective is to find an economic generation schedule for a multiarea system. The interchange transactions among areas represent the transportation problem, embedded within the nonlinear optimization process. The equivalent system concept is adopted, and the transmission losses are included in this study. A four-area system with each area consisting of 26 units was used to test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decomposition approach to nonlinear multi-area generation scheduling with tie-line constraints using expert systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.207362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/5305/00207362.pdf","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.207362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=207362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"A decomposition approach to nonlinear multi-area generation scheduling with tie-line constraints using expert systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4307189","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decomposition approach to nonlinear multi-area generation scheduling with tie-line constraints using expert systems","sourcePdf":"00207362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053253S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"5305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"93","articleId":"207362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":207367,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The authors describe a steady-state security analysis code which overcomes the problem of very short vectors. The length of the list of outages is the major problem in security analysis since it usually includes at least each individual piece of equipment taken one at a time, and a large number of cases with multiple outages. The use of contingency selection and screening has opened the way to reducing this burden, but a very large number of individual cases must be run to satisfy the need to be sure that no cases have gone unchecked. The efforts described have extended the computational speed with which this can be accomplished, and the implementation of very high performance security analysis codes has been made possible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.207367","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/5305/00207367.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.207367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system steady state security analysis using vector processing computers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Power system steady state security analysis using vector processing computers","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4307194","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system steady state security analysis using vector processing computers","sourcePdf":"00207367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025622S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"5305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"16","articleId":"207367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":207375,"authors":[{"name":"W.-H.E.

The eigenvectors are used to describe the mode shape and to provide information about the network elements and generators which participate in each mode.

The study covered the energy storage range from 2 to 200 MWh at power levels from 4 to 400 MW. A SMES that uses high temperature superconductors (HTS) and operates at high magnetic field (e.g. 10 T), can be more compact than a comparable, conventional low-temperature device at lower field. The refrigeration power required for a higher temperature unit (20 to 77 K) will be less by 60% to 90%. The improvement in energy efficiency is significant for small units, but less important for large ones. The material cost for HTS units is dominated by the cost of superconductor, so that the total cost of an HTS system will be comparable to a low temperature system only if the superconductor price in $/ampere-meter is made comparable by increasing current density or decreasing wire cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/5306/00207403.pdf","doi":"10.1109/60.207403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.207403","startPage":"33","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, performance, and cost characteristics of high temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207403/","displayDocTitle":"Design, performance, and cost characteristics of high temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4420047","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, performance, and cost characteristics of high temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage","sourcePdf":"00207403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061984S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"12","articleId":"207403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":207407,"authors":[{"name":"C.-J.

In order to suppress unstable torsional mode oscillations, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is used to modulate the active and reactive power input/output of the SMES unit according to speed deviation of the generator shaft. The gains of the proposed PID controller are determined by pole assignment approach based on modal control theory. Eigenvalue analysis of the studied system shows that the PID controller is quite effective over a wide range of operating conditions. Dynamic simulations using the nonlinear system model are also performed to demonstrate the damping effect of the proposed control scheme under disturbance conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.207407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.207407","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/5306/00207407.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of simultaneous active and reactive power modulation of superconducting magnetic energy storage unit to damp turbine-generator subsynchronous oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Application of simultaneous active and reactive power modulation of superconducting magnetic energy storage unit to damp turbine-generator subsynchronous oscillations","publicationDate":"March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4420051","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207407/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of simultaneous active and reactive power modulation of superconducting magnetic energy storage unit to damp turbine-generator subsynchronous oscillations","sourcePdf":"00207407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031204S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"38","articleId":"207407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":207408,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The ANN was trained by the training data group generated by the adaptive power system stabilizer (APSS). During the training, the ANN was required to memorize and simulate the control strategy of APSS until the differences were within the specified criteria.

A multi-inertia laboratory model equipped with data acquisition and control computers was constructed to model the shaft dynamics of a 660 MW Drax turbine-generator. It is shown that the shaft torsional phenomena can be adequately simulated on a micro-synchronous-generator at least as far as the dominant shaft torsional modes of vibration are concerned. The practical implementation of multi-mode linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers has been shown to enhance system stability and provide better damping to the lower frequency torsional modes, which are those most susceptible to excitation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.207410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.207410","startPage":"85","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/5306/00207410.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbine generator laboratory model tests to damp torsional oscillations with supplementary signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Turbine generator laboratory model tests to damp torsional oscillations with supplementary signals","publicationDate":"March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4420054","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207410/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbine generator laboratory model tests to damp torsional oscillations with supplementary signals","sourcePdf":"00207410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038612S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"9","articleId":"207410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":207413,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This cellular neural network embedded in a dual computing structure (CNND) provides a framework for designing algorithms containing sequences of analog and digital operations. This CNND architecture is then used for some well-defined character recognition tasks. Mainly the recognition of printed characters is studied. Several dual algorithms are introduced for classifying various classes of printed character sets. These algorithms contain analog CNN cloning templates and digital decision functions.

In that architecture, the signal is processed in a spatio-temporal dimension. Time is not the independent variable in the solution of a set of differential equations as in the classical case, but it plays an essential role in the interaction on the time-varying input and its processing. The purpose of the net is not, as usually, to classify and/or recognize patterns, nor to solve a problem of minimum energy, but to detect some characteristics of a signal varying with respect both to time and space. Such a network has been proved useful in solving the problem of detecting moving objects in a cluster. In this part, the architecture of the net is outlined and its performance is discussed together with its similarities and differences with respect to cellular neural networks.

Four types of motion detection problem are studied. The simplest one is a model resembling the experiment of D.H. Hubel and T.N. Wiesel (1962) with a cat's retina for detecting the motion of an object having a given speed in a given direction. The most complicated case is the determination of the vertical and horizontal velocity components of a moving image. Various cloning template sequences are proposed for detecting different types of motion. The consecutive black and white image samples are fed to the input and to the initial state nodes of the cellular neural network, respectively. After the transients have decayed, the output gives the information necessary for detecting the presence or absence of a specific motion as well as for estimating the direction and the magnitude of the velocity vector. Conditions are analysed under which the detection is correct. The circuit realization of some motion detectors are discussed and the use of a programmable dual CNN structure is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1990.207516","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/177/5310/00207516.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1990.207516","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications","startPage":"127","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting simple motion using cellular neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=207516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Detecting simple motion using cellular neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207516/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4012128","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting simple motion using cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"00207516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038192S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec 1990","isNumber":"5310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"177","citationCount":"54","articleId":"207516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":207518,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

Traditional circuit-based simulation of cellular neural networks and analog arrays is very slow and cumbersome. Much of the computation and memory space involved could be reduced if the data and computational structures of the program could mirror the architecture of the analog array. The authors present the details of such a simulator, named ASIM. The computations performed by ASIM are derived directly from the nonlinear differential equations describing the processing at each node and the internal data representation mirrors the architecture of analog arrays. ASIM is a graphical environment for simulating continuous-time continuous-variable computational arrays which have a regular structure, whose connectivity is nearest-neighbor, and whose nodal processing can be described by a set of nonlinear differential equations. The user need specify only the equations for nodal processing and the connectivity to neighboring processors. Input and output are graphical and show the state of all variables in the array as a function of time. The user may incorporate iteration of any internal variable to find optimal processing strategies or neighborhood organization. To aid the evaluation of algorithms which are to be fabricated in VLSI, the use can specify variances in any computational variable to simulate the effect of fabrication tolerances and may specify that certain variables have associated noise components. Both of these features make ASIM an ideal aid in developing analog array and cellular neural network algorithms which are more robust to implementation variability. The ASIM program runs on 80386 based IBM PC/AT computers using the MS-DOS operating system. It requires 2 Mbytes of extended memory and a VGA compatible graphics card.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.1990.207518","startPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/177/5310/00207518.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.1990.207518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIM, an efficient simulation environment for cellular neural networks and analog arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Analog computers","Cellular neural networks","Mirrors","Computer architecture","Differential equations","Nonlinear equations","Very large scale integration","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit analysis computing","computer graphics","digital simulation","IBM computers","microcomputer applications","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nearest-neighbor connectivity","simulation environment","cellular neural networks","analog arrays","ASIM","nonlinear differential equations","internal data representation","graphical environment","continuous-time continuous-variable computational arrays","nodal processing","optimal processing strategies","neighborhood organization","VLSI","80386 based IBM PC/AT computers","MS-DOS","VGA compatible graphics card","2 MByte"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 1990","displayDocTitle":"ASIM, an efficient simulation environment for cellular neural networks and analog arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 1990","accessionNumber":"4023676","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIM, an efficient simulation environment for cellular neural networks and analog arrays","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"00207518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029596S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 1990","isNumber":"5310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"177","citationCount":"1","articleId":"207518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":207519,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The allocator uses performance information for the processes making up the system in order to determine an appropriate mapping of tasks onto processors. It uses several heuristic extensions of the MULTIFIT bin-packing algorithm to find an allocation that will offer a high system throughput, taking into account the expected execution and interprocessor communication requirements of the software on the given hardware architecture. Throughput is evaluated by an asymptotic bound for saturated conditions and under an assumption that only processing resources are required. A set of options are proposed for each of the allocator's major steps. An evaluation was made on 680 small randomly generated examples. Using all the search options, an average performance difference of just over 1% was obtained. Using a carefully chosen small subset of only four options, a further degradation of just over 1.5% was obtained. The allocator is also applied to a digital signal processing system consisting of 119 tasks to illustrate its clustering and load balancing properties on a large system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.207592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/5312/00207592.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.207592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast allocation of processes in distributed and parallel systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fast allocation of processes in distributed and parallel systems","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1993","accessionNumber":"4449467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast allocation of processes in distributed and parallel systems","sourcePdf":"00207592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048457S","chronDate":"Feb 1993","isNumber":"5312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"84","articleId":"207592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":207593,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Even though 100% fault coverage can be theoretically obtained by using these techniques, the system performance, i.e., fault coverage and throughput, can be drastically reduced due to many practical problems, e.g., round-off errors. A novel algorithm-based fault tolerance scheme is proposed for fast Fourier transform (FFT) networks. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves 100% fault coverage theoretically. An accurate measure of the fault coverage for FFT networks is provided by taking the round-off error into account.

The SPMD (single program-multiple data) mode of parallelism is a subset of the MIMD mode where all processors execute the same program. By providing all aspects of the language with an SIMD mode version and an SPMD mode version that are syntactically and semantically equivalent, the language facilitates experimentation with and exploitation of hybrid SIMD/SPMD machines. Language constructs (and their implementations) for data management, data-dependent control-flow, and PE-address-dependent control-flow are presented. These constructs are based on experience gained from programming a parallel machine prototype and are being incorporated into a compiler under development.

As in ECAM, in order to enhance the differences among the weights and make the largest weights more overwhelming, the new model incorporates a nonlinear function in the calculation of weights. Several possible similarity measures suitable for this model are suggested. Simulation results of the performance of the new model with different measures show that, loaded with 500 64-component patterns, the model can sustain noise with power about one fifth to three fifths of the average signal power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.207604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5313","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00207604.png","startPage":"364","endPage":"366","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/5313/00207604.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.207604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivalued associative memories based on recurrent networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Neural networks","Nonlinear equations","Neurons","Swaging","Computational modeling","Information processing","Power system interconnection","Asymptotic stability","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","multivalued neural associative memory model","exponential correlation associative memories","storage capacity","error-correction","weighted average process","similarity-measure computation","nonlinear function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","displayDocTitle":"Multivalued associative memories based on recurrent networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4415968","pubMedId":"18267738","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivalued associative memories based on recurrent networks","sourcePdf":"00207604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028014S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","articleId":"207604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":207608,"authors":[{"name":"A.U.

The approach extends the original work by Kohonen on the convergence properties of such networks in several respects. First, the authors investigate the convergence of the neuron weights directly as compared to Kohonen's treatment of the dynamic behavior of the expectation values of the weights. Second, the problem is formulated for a more general case of selecting the neighborhood amplitude of interaction rather than the uniform amplitude. Third, the proof of convergence is based on the well-known Gladyshev theorem which uses Lyapunov's function method. The authors provide a step-by-step constructive proof which establishes the asymptotic convergence to a unique solution. This proof also provides the relation between the boundary neurons' weight vectors and the number of neurons in the network. The approach is then extended to the two-dimensional case and the result is stated in a theorem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.207609","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00207609.png","startPage":"207","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.207609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/5313/00207609.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the convergence properties of topology preserving neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207609/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the convergence properties of topology preserving neural networks","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4415951","pubMedId":"18267721","publicationDate":"March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the convergence properties of topology preserving neural networks","sourcePdf":"00207609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034845S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"54","articleId":"207609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":207611,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Two multilayer feedforward NNs are utilized to learn and code this nonlinear and complex mapping using the backpropagation learning rule and a training set. The first NN is a conventional fully connected net while the second is a sparsely connected NN with a fixed number of hidden layer nodes. All the applicable constraints are learned and internally coded by the NNs enabling them to be more flexible and more accurate than previous methods.

The new technique is suitable for parallel hardware implementation, with continuous multidimensional training signals. The resulting networks can be used for signal prediction, signal production, and spatiotemporal pattern recognition tasks. Unlike conventional backpropagation networks, they can easily adapt while performing true signal prediction. Simulation results are presented for networks trained to predict future values of the Mackey-Glass chaotic signal, using its present value as an input. For this application, networks with adaptable delays had less than half the prediction error of networks with fixed delays, and about one-quarter the error of conventional networks. After training, the network can be operated in a signal production configuration, where it autonomously generates a close approximation to the Mackey-Glass signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.207622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/5313/00207622.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.207622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5313","startPage":"348","endPage":"354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous-time temporal back-propagation with adaptable time delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=207622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-time temporal back-propagation with adaptable time delays","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4415964","pubMedId":"18267734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-time temporal back-propagation with adaptable time delays","sourcePdf":"00207622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054884S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"5313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"66","articleId":"207622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":207624,"authors":[{"name":"K.-R.

Three dimensional DRAM chips with trench-type capacitors are vulnerable to double-bit soft errors when an alpha particle strikes at the intervening space between two vertical capacitors setting off a plasma discharge between them. The author presents a systematic study of soft-error related problems, and discusses the methodologies to correct the double-bit memory-cells upsets by using on-chip ECC (error-correcting code) circuits. A comprehensive study is made to estimate the improvement in soft-error rate (SER) and mean time between failure (MTBF) by the proposed ECC technique. The ability of the circuit to correct soft errors in the presence of multiple-bit errors has also been analyzed using combinational enumeration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1988.207812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1988.207812","endPage":"288","publicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1988 Proceeding@m_New Frontiers in Testing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1988 Proceeding@m_New Frontiers in Testing","pdfPath":"/iel2/213/5318/00207812.pdf","startPage":"279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-chip double-bit error-correcting code for three-dimensional dynamic random-access memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207812/","displayDocTitle":"An on-chip double-bit error-correcting code for three-dimensional dynamic random-access memory","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 1988","accessionNumber":"3317178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-chip double-bit error-correcting code for three-dimensional dynamic random-access memory","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00207812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060452S","chronDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","isNumber":"5318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"213","citationCount":"5","articleId":"207812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":207820,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Generally, CMOS complex gate require two gate-level representations: one for the n- part and another for the p-. The two representations may not be dual. After transformation, an algorithm based on the GEMINI logic system is used to determine the stuck-open fault coverage of a given test set. Multiple stuck-open faults are handled implicitly. Thus, results are not invalidated in the presence of untested or untestable faults. Robust test sets can be generated easily. The method can be used both for test generation and for fault diagnosis. Experimental results for multiple stuck-open fault coverage for ten benchmarking circuits are presented and compared. In particular, coverage figures for both robust and nonrobust test sets are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00207853.png","displayPublicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1988 Proceeding@m_New Frontiers in Testing","pdfPath":"/iel2/213/5318/00207853.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"694","publicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1988 Proceeding@m_New Frontiers in Testing","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1988.207853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1988.207853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=207853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stuck-open and transition fault testing in CMOS complex gates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Robustness","Logic testing","CMOS logic circuits","System testing","Fault diagnosis","Semiconductor device modeling","Switches","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated logic circuits","logic testing","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple stuck open fault coverage","transition fault testing","CMOS complex gates","stuck-open faults","CMOS networks","equivalent gate-level circuits","GEMINI logic system","benchmarking circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","displayDocTitle":"Stuck-open and transition fault testing in CMOS complex gates","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3327225","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stuck-open and transition fault testing in CMOS complex gates","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00207853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055778S","chronDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","isNumber":"5318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"213","citationCount":"53","articleId":"207853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":207864,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

Bridging fault coverage can be increased by doing fault simulation and test generation for bridging faults that are identified as hard to detect. These bridging faults occur between nodes that rarely, if ever, differ, or that seldom change value. In addition, if the nodes in the fault-free circuits toggle often, feedback faults are easier to detect. This is true even if the nodes involved always have equal values. Methods for identifying such nodes have been presented. These methods use results available from fault-free simulations. A simple solution is to randomly reorder the test vectors to increase toggling and therefore increase bridging fault coverage. As a result, computer time for test generation will be only slightly greater than the time required for stuck-at fault generation alone.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Circuit faults","Electrical fault detection","Circuit testing","CMOS logic circuits","Circuit simulation","Sampling methods","Semiconductor device modeling","Computational modeling","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","fault location","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","logic testing","bridging faults","stuck-at test sets","fault simulation","test generation","feedback faults","test vectors","toggling","computer time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEST.1988.207864","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00207864.png","publicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1988 Proceeding@m_New Frontiers in Testing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1988 Proceeding@m_New Frontiers in Testing","pdfPath":"/iel2/213/5318/00207864.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1988.207864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting bridging faults with stuck-at test sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=207864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detecting bridging faults with stuck-at test sets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207864/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3327234","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting bridging faults with stuck-at test sets","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00207864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033343S","chronDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","isNumber":"5318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"213","citationCount":"72","articleId":"207864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":207869,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

The nominal gate delays with the manufacturing tolerances are an integral part of the model and are used in the propagation of simplified waveforms through the logic network. The faulty waveforms are functions of the variable-size delay fault. For each fault and test pattern, a threshold is computed such that this fault is detected if its size exceeds epsilon . This threshold is used (along with the minimum slack at the fault site) to determine a metric called quality. The quality of detection for a fault measures how close the test came to exposing the ideally smallest-size fault at that point. This metric (together with the traditional fault coverage) gives a complete measure of the goodness of the test.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/207873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sep 1988","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3317204","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Delay test generation.

The feedforward network is found to provide an order-of-magnitude improvement in diagnostic speed while consistently performing as well as or better than any of the other classifiers in terms of accuracy. This makes the feedforward network classifier an excellent candidate for production line diagnosis of IC faults, where circuit verification time greatly influences total cost per part.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VTEST.1991.208158","startPage":"199","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Papers 1991 VLSI Test Symposium 'Chip-to-System Test Concerns for the 90's","pdfPath":"/iel2/493/5321/00208158.pdf","publicationTitle":"Digest of Papers 1991 VLSI Test Symposium 'Chip-to-System Test Concerns for the 90's","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTEST.1991.208158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network diagnosis of IC faults","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Circuit faults","Costs","Production","Circuit testing","Noise measurement","Function approximation","Feedforward neural networks","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","integrated circuit testing","linear integrated circuits","neural nets","production testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","IC faults","feedforward neural networks","analog IC fault diagnosis","large scale production environment","network classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/208158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural network diagnosis of IC faults","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 1991","accessionNumber":"4024412","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network diagnosis of IC faults","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00208158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07503S","chronDate":"15-17 April 1991","isNumber":"5321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"493","citationCount":"6","articleId":"208158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":208161,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.

The proposed circuits offer a new means of a significant improvement in suppressing the output voltage ripple compared with their predecessors. Therefore, the size of the output filter can be considerably reduced, the rI/sub rms//sup 2/ conduction power loss in the equivalent series resistance of the filter capacitor can be lowered, aluminum or tantalum electrolytic capacitors may be entirely eliminated, filter capacitors with low capacitances and thereby high self-resonant frequencies can be used, and a faster dynamic response becomes achievable. ZVR is accomplished by reducing the AC component of the current at the input of the output filter. Class E/sup 2/ and Class D-E ZVR resonant DC/DC power converters are derived using the Class E ZVR rectifiers. An experimental prototype of a Class E/sup 2/ 30 W/500 kHz DC/DC converter was built and tested. Its output voltage ripple was as much as 20 times lower than that of the corresponding conventional converter. The new converters are suitable for noise-sensitive high-output-current applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/5331/00208494.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","doi":"10.1109/63.208494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.208494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-voltage-ripple rectifiers and DC/DC resonant converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/208494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Zero-voltage-ripple rectifiers and DC/DC resonant converters","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4435447","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-voltage-ripple rectifiers and DC/DC resonant converters","sourcePdf":"00208494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057228S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"5331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"8","articleId":"208494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":208495,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A control scheme is derived that directly calculates the duration of time spent on the zero state and on each switching state adjacent to the reference vector, over a constant switching interval, in order to drive the line current vector to the reference vector. In addition, under transient conditions, when deadbeat control is not possible, a control scheme is presented that ensures that the line current vector is driven in the direction of the reference current vector. The current reference for the rectifier controller is derived from the bus voltage error and a feedforward term based on the estimated converter output power. The proposed space vector-based rectifier regulator is shown to exhibit improved harmonic and transient performance over existing per-phase duty cycle prediction methods, especially at modulation indices near unity. The deadbeat control of the rectifier input current is accomplished every half-cycle with constant switching frequency while still symmetrically distributing the zero state within the half-cycle period.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.208497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/5331/00208497.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.208497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A space vector-based rectifier regulator for AC/DC/AC converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=208497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A space vector-based rectifier regulator for AC/DC/AC converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/208497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4435450","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A space vector-based rectifier regulator for AC/DC/AC converters","sourcePdf":"00208497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036818S","chronDate":"Jan.  1993","isNumber":"5331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"261","articleId":"208497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":208503,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

Different continuous system approximate models for the stability analysis of the system are developed and their validity is investigated. In particular, it is shown that continuous system approximate models, in which only the principal component of the open-loop pulse transfer function is considered, cannot be used for pulsed stability analysis and closed-loop design of the system. Although these approximate analyses can be misleading and/or erroneous, a standard method such as z-domain analysis or pulse transfer function analysis in the s domain in which the sampling effect is not neglected yields useful results. A frequency domain method based on direct computation of a pulse transfer function in the s domain is used for pulsed stability analysis. The closed-loop operation of the system with a proportional-integral controller is investigated.

The hierarchical yield estimates agree well with the benchmark of device-level circuit simulation of the complete circuit and are less computationally expensive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5446/00209986.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.209986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.209986","startPage":"203","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical yield estimation of large analog integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/209986/","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical yield estimation of large analog integrated circuits","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4409520","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical yield estimation of large analog integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00209986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037946S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"24","articleId":"209986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":209988,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

This approach is ideally suited to modular memories embedded within synchronous systems due to its simple boundary specification, excellent speed/power performance, and ease of modelling. The basic port design is self-contained and extensible to any number of ports sharing access to a common-core cell array. The same design has been used to implement modular one-, two-, and four-part SRAMs and a one-port DRAM based on a four-transistor (4-T) cell. The latter provides a 45% core cell density improvement over the one-port SRAM. Nominal access and cycle times of 5.5 ns for 64 kb blocks have been shown for a 0.8 mu m BiCMOS process with no memory process enhancements. System operation at 100 MHz has been demonstrated on a broadband time-switch chip containing 96 kb of two-port SRAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Read-write memory","Registers","Switches","Built-in self-test","Power system modeling","Digital integrated circuits","Software libraries","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","built-in self test","DRAM chips","SRAM chips","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-port SRAM","access time","BiCMOS","modular memory family","DRAM","multiport SRAM","modular memories","built-in self-test interface","synchronous self-timed architecture","embedded within synchronous systems","boundary specification","speed/power performance","ease of modelling","port design","common-core cell array","core cell density","cycle times","broadband time-switch chip","two-port SRAM","180 MHz","96 kbit","0.8 micron","5.5 ns","100 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=209988","doi":"10.1109/4.209988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5446/00209988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.209988","startPage":"222","endPage":"232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 180 MHz 0.8 mu m BiCMOS modular memory family of DRAM and multiport SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 180 MHz 0.8 mu m BiCMOS modular memory family of DRAM and multiport SRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/209988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4409522","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 180 MHz 0.8 mu m BiCMOS modular memory family of DRAM and multiport SRAM","sourcePdf":"00209988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081588S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"19","articleId":"209988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":209990,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

Two mathematical integer programming (IP) models are presented. The first simultaneously selects types of functional units, performs scheduling tasks, and allocates hardware. The second additionally minimizes latency and optimally selects a clock period simultaneously with scheduling and allocation. By exploiting the problem structure, using polyhedral theory, the size of the search space of both IP models is decreased, thus improving the IP solution efficiency. This approach breaks new ground by simultaneously scheduling and allocating with complex and asynchronous interface constraints, to minimize both the average execution time and the area, automatically minimizing latency by optimally selecting the clock period and types of functional units (including chained operations), and synthesizing globally optimal architectures of embedded VLSI chips in practical CPU execution times.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5446/00209990.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.209990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.209990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=209990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesizing embedded speed-optimized architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Clocks","Delay","Synthesizers","Job shop scheduling","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Pipeline processing","Linear programming","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","integer programming","integrated logic circuits","resource allocation","scheduling","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming models","search space reduction","clock period optimisation","functional units selection","area minimisation","embedded speed-optimized architectures","global optimization approach","high-level synthesis","speed-optimized embedded VLSI architectures","scheduling tasks","allocates hardware","minimizes latency","scheduling","allocation","problem structure","polyhedral theory","asynchronous interface constraints","average execution time","minimizing latency","chained operations","synthesizing globally optimal architectures","embedded VLSI chips","CPU execution times"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/209990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Synthesizing embedded speed-optimized architectures","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4409524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesizing embedded speed-optimized architectures","sourcePdf":"00209990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042301S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","articleId":"209990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":209991,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The delay cells employ negative feedback to produce a 'virtual earth' at the input node to improve transmission accuracy. Fully differential structures with common-mode feedback are used to reduce charge injection errors and crosstalk from digital signals. An IC test circuit, in a 1 mu m standard digital CMOS process, containing simple delay lines and an FIR filter section is described, and measured performance is given. Typically, a 2T delay line sampling at 13.3 MHz gave a low-frequency gain error of -54 dB, a settling error of -60 dB, a third-harmonic distortion of -40 dB with 75% modulation, and an S/N ratio of 60 dB. Scaling of the memory cell device dimensions and currents should permit SI operation at clock frequencies beyond 100 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/209998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4409532","displayDocTitle":"Switched-current signal processing for video frequencies and beyond","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-current signal processing for video frequencies and beyond","sourcePdf":"00209998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039574S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"79","articleId":"209998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":209999,"authors":[{"name":"S.-S.

The basic building block is a differential current integrator with its gain constant set by a small-signal transconductance and a gate capacitance. A prototype fifth-order low-pass ladder filter implemented in a standard digital 2 mu m n-well CMOS process achieved a -3 dB cutoff frequency (f/sub 0/) of 42 MHz; f/sub 0/ was tunable from 24 to 42 MHZ by varying a reference bias current from 50 to 150 mu A. Using a single 5 V power supply with a nominal reference current of 100 mu A, the five-pole filter dissipated 25.5 mW. The active filter area was 0.056 mm/sup 2//pole. With the minimum input signal defined as the input-referred noise integrated over a 40 MHz bandwidth, and the maximum input signal defined at the 1% total intermodulation distortion (TIMD) level, the measured dynamic range was 69 dB. A third-order elliptic low-pass ladder filter was also integrated in the 2 mu m n-well CMOS process to verify the implementation of finite transmission zeros.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.209999","startPage":"323","endPage":"329","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5446/00209999.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.209999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS continuous-time current-mode filters for high-frequency applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Low pass filters","CMOS process","Transconductance","Capacitance","Prototypes","Digital filters","Cutoff frequency","Power supplies","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","CMOS integrated circuits","ladder networks","linear integrated circuits","low-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elliptic filter","continuous-time","current-mode filters","high-frequency applications","differential current integrator","small-signal transconductance","gate capacitance","fifth-order","low-pass ladder filter","reference bias current","single 5 V power supply","five-pole filter","third-order","n-well CMOS process","finite transmission zeros","24 to 42 MHz","50 to 150 muA","5 V","25.5 mW","2 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/209999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"CMOS continuous-time current-mode filters for high-frequency applications","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4409533","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS continuous-time current-mode filters for high-frequency applications","sourcePdf":"00209999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065293S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"5446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"110","articleId":"209999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"}]
