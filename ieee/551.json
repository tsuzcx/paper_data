In the COG bonding, there are two different interfaces, Cu-Au and Au-Al couples, which is totally different from either Cu or Au wire bonding. In this paper, the COG bonding was studied on a typical experimental chip of 69-\u03bcm bond pad opening and four-layer central via pattern design with current wire bonders. Tests of wire pull, ball shear, and crater were adopted in investigating the bonding strength at the interfaces and the potential damage of the underlying metals of bond pads after the COG bonding. The intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formation at the two interfaces, Cu-Au and Au-Al couples, were studied in detail on the cross-sectioned assembled samples. Two reliability tests, high-temperature baking (HTB) and temperature cycle (TC) were also used to investigate the IMC change and growth. The results showed that qualified bonding strength on all of bond pads existed and no damage such as crack and crater was observed on the underlying metals of the bond pads after removing Al metallization. At the Au-Al interface, a comparable Au-Al IMC was formed on as-bonded samples, and it gradually grew thick after the reliability tests and its corresponding content also changed along with temperature and time. At the Cu-Au interface, there was no observable formation of Cu-Al IMC on as-bonded samples. Undergoing 1008 hours HTB at 175\u00b0C, only a very thin Cu-Au IMC appeared at the Cu-Au interface. After all, the Cu-Au IMC appearance hardly affects the IC's mechanical performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5547553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104/5547553/05510004.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEPM.2010.2053544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEPM.2010.2053544","startPage":"228","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formation and Growth of Intermetallic Compounds in Cu\u2013Au and Au\u2013Al Systems for Copper on Gold Bonding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510004/","displayDocTitle":"Formation and Growth of Intermetallic Compounds in Cu\u2013Au and Au\u2013Al Systems for Copper on Gold Bonding","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510004/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11472530","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formation and Growth of Intermetallic Compounds in Cu\u2013Au and Au\u2013Al Systems for Copper on Gold Bonding","sourcePdf":"tepm-jiang-2053544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112355S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"5547553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5547553","articleId":"5510004","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510007,"authors":[{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5547548/5510007/5510007-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daehyun Kang received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from the Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2006, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyungbuk, Korea.","His main interests are RF circuits for wireless communications, especially highly efficient and linear RF transmitters and RF PA design."]},"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37289143600"},{"name":"Jinsung Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5547548/5510007/5510007-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsung Choi received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyungbuk, Korea, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently with the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Korea.

Stepped-impedance resonators (SIRs) are usually used for designing dual-band bandpass filters; however, they have a strong common-mode response when designing a balanced filter. To suppress the common-mode signal, a half-wavelength SIR loaded by a capacitor or a resistor has been introduced and theoretically analyzed. It is found that the capacitor can minimize the common-mode external quality factor, and the resistor can reduce the common-mode unloaded quality factor. With the use of this property, the common-mode response can be suppressed, whereas the differential-mode response is almost unaffected. This property can be easily verified by comparing the results of the balanced bandpass filters with and without loaded elements. To demonstrate the design idea, one balanced dual-band bandpass filter operating at 2.4 and 5 GHz and another balanced single-band bandpass filter with a wide stopband are designed. It was found that the common-mode suppression level of both filters can be greatly improved, and high selectivity is obtained by giving two differential-mode coupling paths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Band and Wide-Stopband Single-Band Balanced Bandpass Filters With High Selectivity and Common-Mode Suppression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2052959","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5547548/05510009.pdf","startPage":"2204","endPage":"2212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2052959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5547548","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Band and Wide-Stopband Single-Band Balanced Bandpass Filters With High Selectivity and Common-Mode Suppression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5510009/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11472356","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Band and Wide-Stopband Single-Band Balanced Bandpass Filters With High Selectivity and Common-Mode Suppression","sourcePdf":"tmtt-shi-2052959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088925S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5547548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5547548","articleId":"5510009","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5510018,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel V.

Efficient multiplexing techniques (wavelengths, time, and space) allow bandwidths to scale; static or predetermined resource allocation of wavelengths can be detrimental to network performance for nonuniform (adversial) workloads. Dynamic bandwidth reallocation (DBR) based on actual traffic pattern can lead to improved network performance by utilizing idle resources. While DBR techniques can alleviate interconnection bottlenecks, power consumption also increases considerably with increase in bit rate and channels. In this paper, we propose to improve the performance of optical interconnects using DBR techniques and simultaneously optimize the power consumption using dynamic power management (DPM) techniques. DBR reallocates idle channels to busy channels (wavelengths) for improving throughput, and DPM regulates the bit rates and supply voltages for the individual channels. A reconfigurable optoelectronic architecture and a performance adaptive algorithm for implementing DBR and DPM are proposed in this paper. Our proposed reconfiguration algorithm achieves a significant reduction in power consumption and considerable improvement in throughput, with a marginal increase in latency for synthetic and real (Splash-2) traffic traces.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2051419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5743095/05510030.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2051419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5743095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient and Bandwidth-Reconfigurable Photonic Networks for High-Performance Computing (HPC) Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient and Bandwidth-Reconfigurable Photonic Networks for High-Performance Computing (HPC) Systems","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2011","accessionNumber":"11911232","htmlLink":"/document/5510030/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient and Bandwidth-Reconfigurable Photonic Networks for High-Performance Computing (HPC) Systems","sourcePdf":"jstqe-kodi-2051419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068018S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5743095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5743095","articleId":"5510030","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510032,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdieh B.

In that work, we assumed knowledge of a fiber's principal modes (PMs) and their group delays (GDs), enabling us to compute the optimal settings of the optical system. In practice, however, we do not have prior knowledge of the PMs and their GDs. In this paper, for three of the configurations, we propose algorithms for setting the optical system adaptively, based upon measurements of the eye opening. We present simulations showing that in the absence of noise, the performance of the adaptive solution approaches that of the optimal solution, and characterizing the algorithms' convergence speed and tolerance to noise.

The quality of the block correlation depends on the validity of the brightness constancy assumption and the assumption of fixed translational motion within a block. These assumptions are invalid in areas with texture changes, noise, lighting changes, and rapid deformations. Smoothness priors should enforce stable estimates in these regions by propagating neighboring estimates, while preserving hard object boundaries (piecewise smoothness). Most motion estimation algorithms that successfully implement these constraints are computationally complex. In this paper, we show an intuitive and computationally efficient way to implement them within the framework of (real-time) recursive search, targeting consumer-market embedded devices with limited resources.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2058474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2058474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599342","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5599342/05510117.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Motion compensation","Equations","Optimization methods","Flat panel displays","Image motion analysis","Vectors","Optical materials","Permission","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","image texture","motion compensation","motion estimation","recursive estimation","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smoothness constraint","recursive search motion estimation","picture rate conversion","motion compensation algorithms","block matching","block correlation","brightness constancy assumption","translational motion","consumer-market embedded devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matching","motion compensation (MC)","motion estimation (ME)","recursive search (RS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Smoothness Constraints in Recursive Search Motion Estimation for Picture Rate Conversion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510117/","volume":"20","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5510117/","accessionNumber":"11575404","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smoothness Constraints in Recursive Search Motion Estimation for Picture Rate Conversion","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-bartels-2058474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066376S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5599342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5599342","articleId":"5510117","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5510118,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5599342/5510118/5510118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Han Tsai (M'98) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1990, 1994, and 1998, respectively.","From 1999 to 2000, he was an Associate Professor of electronic engineering with Fu Jen University, Hsinchuang, Taiwan.

In this paper, the high-speed EC algorithm is proposed for advanced-HD specification. It mainly comprises three features: 1) the associated geometric-based probability model is developed to construct context-modeling mechanism without context-table; 2) develop content-adaptive Golomb-Rice code and geometric-based binary code as the entropy coding with minor order of context; and 3) provide the rate control mechanism to guarantee the saving ratio of memory bandwidth and capacity. With competitive coding efficiency, the computation-efficiency of the proposed EC algorithm is about 44% and 40% of FELICS and JPEG-LS. The proposed very-large-scale integration architecture of entire codec is implemented in TSMC 0.18- 1P6M CMOS technology. Based on pixel-based parallelism and segment-based parallelism techniques, the encoding/decoding capability reaches Quad Full-high definition (QFHD) (3840 \u00d7 2160) at 30 Hz. The maximum throughput is as high as 6.4 Gbit/s. Furthermore, with multi-level parallelism, the performance can be extended to QHD (2560 \u00d7 1440) at 120 Hz and QFHD at 120 Hz for the double frame rate technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5599342/05510118.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2057770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2057770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 6.4 Gbit/s Embedded Compression Codec for Memory-Efficient Applications on Advanced-HD Specification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codecs","Parallel processing","Bandwidth","CMOS technology","Displays","Solid modeling","Context modeling","Binary codes","Entropy coding","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","CMOS integrated circuits","decoding","display instrumentation","entropy codes","high definition television","parallel architectures","probability","video codecs","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded compression codec","memory-efficient application","advanced-HD specification","memory bandwidth","display system","high-speed EC algorithm","geometric-based probability model","context-modeling mechanism","content-adaptive Golomb-Rice code","geometric-based binary code","entropy coding","rate control mechanism","very-large-scale integration architecture","1P6M CMOS technology","pixel-based parallelism","segment-based parallelism","encoding-decoding capability","quad full-high definition display","bit rate 6.4 Gbit/s","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Context-modeling","embedded compression (EC)","lossless/near-lossless compression","rate control","very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 6.4 Gbit/s Embedded Compression Codec for Memory-Efficient Applications on Advanced-HD Specification","volume":"20","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5510118/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575403","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 6.4 Gbit/s Embedded Compression Codec for Memory-Efficient Applications on Advanced-HD Specification","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lee-2057770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069345S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5599342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5599342","articleId":"5510118","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5510121,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Ti Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrophysics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5552158/5510121/5510121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuan-Ti Wang was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1983.

We propose a distributed event-triggering scheme, where a subsystem broadcasts its state information to its neighbors only when the subsystem's local state error exceeds a specified threshold. In this scheme, a subsystem is able to make broadcast decisions using its locally sampled data. It can also locally predict the maximal allowable number of successive data dropouts (MANSD) and the state-based deadlines for transmission delays. Moreover, the designer's selection of the local event for a subsystem only requires information on that individual subsystem. Our analysis applies to both linear and nonlinear subsystems. Designing local events for a nonlinear subsystem requires us to find a controller that ensures that subsystem to be input-to-state stable. For linear subsystems, the design problem becomes a linear matrix inequality feasibility problem. With the assumption that the number of each subsystem's successive data dropouts is less than its MANSD, we show that if the transmission delays are zero, the resulting system is finite-gain \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Lp</i>\n stable. If the delays are bounded by given deadlines, the system is asymptotically stable. We also show that those state-based deadlines for transmission delays are always greater than a positive constant.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2057951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5725246/05510124.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2057951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggering in Distributed Networked Control Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggering in Distributed Networked Control Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510124/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11851239","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510124/","volume":"56","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Triggering in Distributed Networked Control Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-wang-2057951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099048S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5725246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"821","xplore-issue":"5725246","articleId":"5510124","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5510130,"authors":[{"name":"Frieder Endrejat","affiliation":["Sasol Technology Private Limited, Secunda, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5577442/5510130/5510130-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frieder Endrejat (M'06\u2013SM'09) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.","Since 1999, he has been with Sasol Technology (Pty) Ltd., Secunda, South Africa.

Challenges faced during commissioning are described, and associated solutions are presented. A failure analysis of the ASD during commissioning is presented. An ASD design review was undertaken, which has resulted in an improved alternative to the conventional high-voltage busbar design. A protection-coordination study incorporating incoming switchgear and internal drive protection functions is presented. Improved protection schemes and settings are described to obtain faster coordinated fault clearance and improved ASD availability.

Accordingly, academic researches and companies have developed active noise-reducing headsets to cancel annoying noise at such lower frequencies using expensive digital signal processors (DSPs). This paper develops a modified feedback active noise control (ANC)algorithm to design an active noise-reducing headset with a low-cost microcontroller unit (MCU), offering a cheaper solution to noise reduction than existing audio headsets. The ways to save the computing load of a least mean square (LMS) algorithm by a microcontroller and to compensate for the output limit of speakers in a headset are also provided. Experimental results show that the proposed approach removes disturbing noise very well and outperforms the commercial headset.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2058071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05510140.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2058071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Noise Control in Headsets by Using a Low-Cost Microcontroller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510140/","displayDocTitle":"Active Noise Control in Headsets by Using a Low-Cost Microcontroller","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929549","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510140/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Noise Control in Headsets by Using a Low-Cost Microcontroller","sourcePdf":"tie-chang-2058071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065755S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5510140","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5510142,"authors":[{"name":"Da-Wei Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Key Laboratory of Advanced Control of Iron and Steel Process Ministry of Education, School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5594723/5510142/5510142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Da-Wei Ding received the B.E. degree from the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2010.","In January 2010, he joined the School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China.

In this paper, the analytical inverse of a generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is formulated to compensate for hysteresis nonlinearities of smart actuators. The generalized model was modified to ensure its continuity, and its validity in characterizing different hysteresis properties is briefly demonstrated by comparing the model responses with the measured data for the magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys (SMA), and piezo micropositioning actuators. Since the proposed generalized model is a mere extension of the analytically invertible classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, an inverse of the generalized model is formulated using the inverse of the classical model together with those of the envelope functions of the generalized play operator. The effectiveness of the inverse of the generalized model in compensating for the symmetric and asymmetric saturated hysteresis effects is subsequently investigated through simulations for a magnetostrictive and a SMA actuators, and through preliminary experiments performed on a piezo micropositioning stage. The simulation results suggest that the inverse of the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model can be conveniently applied as a feedforward compensator to effectively mitigate the effects of the asymmetric and saturated hysteresis in magnetostrictive and SMA actuators. The experimental results further revealed that the proposed generalized analytical inverse model can be conveniently implemented as a real-time feedforward compensator to compensate for hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezo micropositioining stage.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2010.2052366","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5765521/05510155.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2010.2052366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Generalized Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii Model Inversion for Hysteresis Compensation in Micropositioning Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510155/","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Generalized Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii Model Inversion for Hysteresis Compensation in Micropositioning Control","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"11987643","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510155/","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Generalized Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii Model Inversion for Hysteresis Compensation in Micropositioning Control","sourcePdf":"tmech-maljanaideh-2052366-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091515S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5765521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"5765521","articleId":"5510155","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5510165,"authors":[{"name":"Chintan Patel","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science, CEDT, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5510165/5510165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chintan Patel (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from South Gujarat University, Surat, India, in 2000, and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Institute of Technology\u2013Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, in 2003.

In this paper, a new technique for sensorless operation is developed to estimate rotor voltage and hence rotor flux position using the stator current error during zero-voltage space vectors. It gives a comparable performance with the vector control drive using sensors especially at a very low speed of operation (less than 1 Hz). Since no voltage sensing is made, the dead-time effect and loss of accuracy in voltage sensing at low speed are avoided here, with the inherent advantages of the current error space phasor-based hysteresis controller. However, appropriate device on-state drops are compensated to achieve a steady-state operation up to less than 1 Hz. Moreover, using a parabolic boundary for current error, the switching frequency of the inverter can be maintained constant for the entire operating speed range.

The motivation of this paper is to simplify the program complexity of the controller by reducing the number of fuzzy sets of the membership functions (MFs) without losing the system performance and stability via the adjustable controller gain. For both types of controllers, the output SF of the controller can be tuned continuously by a gain updating factor, whose value is derived from the fuzzy logic reasoning, with the plant error and the error change ratio as the input variables. The rule bases are created based on the knowledge of the SRM's dynamic behavior and practical experience. Various aspects of the design considerations about the MF, rule base, and gain tuning strategy are described in detail. Experimental results, carried out on a four-phase 8/6-pole SRM based on the dSPACE DS1104 platform, are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the devised methods.

It is required, in this case, to detect the fault condition as early as possible, with specified degree of confidence and a prescribed false alarm rate. Innovative features of the enabling technologies include a Bayesian estimation algorithm called particle filtering, which employs features or condition indicators derived from sensor data in combination with simple models of the system's degrading state to detect a deviation or discrepancy between a baseline (no-fault) distribution and its current counterpart. The scheme requires a fault progression model describing the degrading state of the system in the operation. A generic model based on fatigue analysis is provided and its parameters adaptation is discussed in detail. The scheme provides the probability of abnormal condition and the presence of a fault is confirmed for a given confidence level. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated with data acquired from bearings typically found on aircraft and monitored via a properly instrumented test rig.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2058072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05510168.pdf","startPage":"2011","endPage":"2018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2058072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Fault Detection Approach: Application to Bearing Fault Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510168/","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Fault Detection Approach: Application to Bearing Fault Detection","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11929551","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510168/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Fault Detection Approach: Application to Bearing Fault Detection","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2058072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065248S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5510168","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5510176,"authors":[{"name":"Zeshui Xu","affiliation":["College of Economics and Management, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China","Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zeshui","lastName":"Xu","id":"37532823900"},{"name":"Xiaoqiang Cai","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqiang","lastName":"Cai","id":"37277224900"},{"name":"Shousheng Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Sciences, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shousheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538544400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4427"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2426"}],"articleNumber":"5510176","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this correspondence paper, we consider a large group decision-making problem in which the decision makers provide their preferences over a number of alternatives using distinct preference structures, including the following: 1) utility values; 2) preference orderings; 3) multiplicative preference relations; 4) incomplete multiplicative preference relations; 5) fuzzy preference relations; and 6) incomplete fuzzy preference relations.

Radar has long been a staple of signal processing, and MIMO radar presents challenges and opportunities in adapting classical radar imaging tools and developing new ones. Our aim in this article is to showcase the potential of tensor algebra and multidimensional harmonic retrieval (HR) in signal processing for MIMO radar. Tensor algebra and multidimensional HR are relatively mature topics, albeit still on the fringes of signal processing research. We show they are in fact central for target localization in a variety of pertinent MIMO radar scenarios. Tensor algebra naturally comes into play when the coherent processing interval comprises multiple pulses, or multiple transmit and receive subarrays are used (multistatic configuration). Multidimensional harmonic structure emerges for far-field uniform linear transmit/receive array configurations, also taking into account Doppler shift; and hybrid models arise in-between. This viewpoint opens the door for the application and further development of powerful algorithms and identifiability results for MIMO radar. Compared to the classical radar-imaging-based methods such as Capon or MUSIC, these algebraic techniques yield improved performance, especially for closely spaced targets, at modest complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2058802","startPage":"5693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05510180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2058802","endPage":"5705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Algebra and Multidimensional Harmonic Retrieval in Signal Processing for MIMO Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Algebra and Multidimensional Harmonic Retrieval in Signal Processing for MIMO Radar","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5510180/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11575481","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor Algebra and Multidimensional Harmonic Retrieval in Signal Processing for MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-nion-2058802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227796S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5510180","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5510181,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Liang Yu","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhu Liang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37334519000"},{"name":"Zhenghui Gu","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghui","lastName":"Gu","id":"37536842800"},{"name":"Jianjiang Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291309400"},{"name":"Yuanqing Li","affiliation":["College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Li","id":"37279895500"},{"name":"Wee Ser","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wee","lastName":"Ser","id":"37271375600"},{"name":"Meng Hwa Er","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meng Hwa","lastName":"Er","id":"37271405000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5510181","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1015},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Interference constraints","Signal to noise ratio","Microphone arrays","Erbium","Noise robustness","Array signal processing","Permission","Space technology","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","matrix algebra","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive beamformer","worst-case semidefinite programming","steering direction error","worst-case optimization technique","arbitrary array imperfections","weighting matrix","spectral factorization approach","weighting vector","signal power","waveform estimation","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive array","constraints on magnitude response","robust adaptive beamforming","semi-definite programming","spectral factorization","worst-case optimization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Adaptive Beamformer Based on Worst-Case Semi-Definite Programming","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2058107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599326","endPage":"5919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5599326/05510181.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2058107","startPage":"5914","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510181","abstract":"In this correspondence, a novel robust adaptive beamformer is proposed based on the worst-case semi-definite programming (SDP). A recent paper has reported that a beamformer robust against large steering direction error can be constructed by using linear constraints on magnitude response in SDP formulation. In practice, however, array system also suffers from many other array imperfections other than steering direction error. In order to make the adaptive beamformer robust against all kinds of array imperfections, the worst-case optimization technique is proposed to reformulate the beamformer by minimizing the array output power with respect to the worst-case array imperfections. The resultant beamformer has the mathematical form of a regularized SDP problem and possesses superior robustness against arbitrary array imperfections. Although the formulation of robust beamformer uses weighting matrix, with the help of spectral factorization approach, the weighting vector can be obtained so that the beamformer can be used for both signal power and waveform estimation. Simple implementation, flexible performance control, as well as significant signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) enhancement, support the practicability of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11575486","htmlLink":"/document/5510181/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Adaptive Beamformer Based on Worst-Case Semi-Definite Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Adaptive Beamformer Based on Worst-Case Semi-Definite Programming","sourcePdf":"tsp-yu-2058107-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082477S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5599326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5599326","articleId":"5510181","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5510182,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37534286600"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"},{"name":"Richard Langley","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Langley","id":"37266755400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5510182","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":649},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Covariance matrix","Degradation","Interference suppression","Permission","Distortion","Interference constraints","Array signal processing","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SINR analysis","subtraction-based SMI beamformer","sample matrix inversion beamformer","finite sample size effect","arrival angle mismatch problem","beamformer weight vector","closed-form approximations","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"The sample matrix inversion (SMI) beamformer suffers from performance degradation due to the finite sample size effect and the arrival angle mismatch problem.

The jumping parameters are determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, and the mixed time delays under consideration comprise both time-varying delays and continuously distributed delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, till now, the exponential stability problem for this class of generalized neural networks has not yet been solved since continuously distributed delays are considered in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11450108","pubMedId":"20639177","volume":"21","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5510187/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Exponential Stability of Markovian Jump Impulsive Stochastic Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks With Mixed Time Delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Exponential Stability of Markovian Jump Impulsive Stochastic Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks With Mixed Time Delays","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhu-2054108-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110732S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5536895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"253","xplore-issue":"5536895","articleId":"5510187","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":5510191,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5601981/5510191/5510191-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Shi (S\u201902\u2013M\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2007.","He is currently a Research Scientist with the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech.

We study this problem with joint consideration of power control, scheduling, and routing. Even under a centralized approach, such a problem has a mixed-integer nonlinear program formulation and is likely NP-hard. Thus, a distributed problem is very challenging. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a distributed optimization algorithm that iteratively increases data rates for user communication sessions. During each iteration, our algorithm has routing, minimalist scheduling, and power control/scheduling modules for improving the current solution at all three layers. To evaluate the performance of the distributed optimization algorithm, we compare it with an upper bound of the objective function. Results show that the distributed optimization algorithm can achieve a performance close to this upper bound. Because the optimal solution (unknown) is between the upper bound and the solution obtained by our distributed algorithm, we conclude that the results obtained by our distributed algorithm are highly competitive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588245","htmlLink":"/document/5510191/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Cross-Layer Optimization for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Cross-Layer Optimization for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-hou-2058875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101378S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5601981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5601981","articleId":"5510191","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5510238,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Abbasi","affiliation":["Sheldon B.

These concerns can often make it difficult to harness the augmented discriminatory potential of extended feature sets. We propose a rule-based multivariate text feature selection method called Feature Relation Network (FRN) that considers semantic information and also leverages the syntactic relationships between n-gram features. FRN is intended to efficiently enable the inclusion of extended sets of heterogeneous n-gram features for enhanced sentiment classification. Experiments were conducted on three online review testbeds in comparison with methods used in prior sentiment classification research. FRN outperformed the comparison univariate, multivariate, and hybrid feature selection methods; it was able to select attributes resulting in significantly better classification accuracy irrespective of the feature subset sizes. Furthermore, by incorporating syntactic information about n-gram relations, FRN is able to select features in a more computationally efficient manner than many multivariate and hybrid techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"447","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5695003/05510238.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting Attributes for Sentiment Classification Using Feature Relation Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Machine learning","Text mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attributes selection","sentiment classification","feature relation networks","n-gram features","FRN","semantic information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Natural language processing","machine learning","text mining","subspace selection","affective computing."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Selecting Attributes for Sentiment Classification Using Feature Relation Networks","volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11762034","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5510238/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510238/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting Attributes for Sentiment Classification Using Feature Relation Networks","sourcePdf":"ttk2011030447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12039S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5695003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5695003","articleId":"5510238","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510240,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Sommer","affiliation":["Computer Networks and Communication Systems Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5640589/5510240/5510240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christoph Sommer received the MSc degree in computer science from the University of Erlangen, Germany, in 2006.

Because practical experiments are often not feasible, simulation of network protocol behavior in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) scenarios is strongly demanded for evaluating the applicability of developed network protocols. In this work, we discuss the need for bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic microsimulation for evaluating IVC protocols. As the selection of a mobility model influences the outcome of simulations to a great extent, the use of a representative model is necessary for producing meaningful evaluation results. Based on these observations, we developed the hybrid simulation framework Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation), composed of the network simulator OMNeT++ and the road traffic simulator SUMO. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate its advantages and the need for bidirectionally coupled simulation based on the evaluation of two protocols for incident warning over VANETs. With our developed methodology, we can advance the state-of-the-art in performance evaluation of IVC and provide means to evaluate developed protocols more accurately.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.133","startPage":"3","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5640589/05510240.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectionally Coupled Network and Road Traffic Simulation for Improved IVC Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectionally Coupled Network and Road Traffic Simulation for Improved IVC Analysis","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11654734","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5510240/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectionally Coupled Network and Road Traffic Simulation for Improved IVC Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttm2011010003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095063S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5640589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"812","xplore-issue":"5640589","articleId":"5510240","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5510253,"authors":[{"name":"N.

First of all, a good efficiency is essential in order to save power and battery life-time. Then, to cater to multi-standards operation which provide very high data rates, strong linearity performances are mandatory, to the expense of transmit front-end efficiency. As RF Power Amplifiers (PAs) are the most power consuming components, this paper describes an approach of managing the efficiency-linearity trade-off by using dynamic biasing. The dynamic biasing allows a power control of the PA and is brought into play both with an open-loop solution and a closed-loop solution. The main purpose of the paper is to present a description of the circuits developed and their performances in terms of output power, linearity and efficiency. The reconfigurable PAs are dedicated to UMTS-WCDMA and WiFi/WiMAX standards.","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510253","startPage":"232","endPage":"235","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5506322/5510244/05510253.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic biasing techniques for RF power amplifier linearity and efficiency improvement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic biasing techniques for RF power amplifier linearity and efficiency improvement","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510253/","accessionNumber":"11417104","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510253/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic biasing techniques for RF power amplifier linearity and efficiency improvement","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"55SessionMDeltimple.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073519S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5506322","isNumber":"5510244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5506322","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5510244","articleId":"5510253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5510258,"authors":[{"name":"Taejoong Song","affiliation":["ECE Department, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Taejoong","lastName":"Song","id":"37065894200"},{"name":"Sang Min Lee","affiliation":["ECE Department, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sang Min","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281156400"},{"name":"Jaehyouk Choi","affiliation":["ECE Department, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaehyouk","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405965600"},{"name":"Stephen Kim","affiliation":["ECE Department, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404975100"},{"name":"Gyuhong Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gyuhong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278739400"},{"name":"Kyutae Lim","affiliation":["ECE Department, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyutae","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280714900"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["ECE Department, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5775-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5773-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5774-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2381-3555"}],"articleNumber":"5510258","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":672},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Samarium","Leakage current","Random access memory","CMOS technology","Degradation","Voltage control","Testing","SRAM chips","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS memory circuits","electric potential","electric resistance","flip-flops","integrated circuit testing","leakage currents","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["latch-type sense amplifier","adaptive latch resistance","latch path","erroneous voltage drop","bit-lines","bit-cell leakage current","sense amplifier margin","SA test chip","CMOS technology","supply voltage","SRAM","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["latch sense amplifier","SRAM","bit-cell","leakage current"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510258","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510244","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5506322/5510244/05510258.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust latch-type sense amplifier using adaptive latch resistance","abstract":"A latch-type sense amplifier (SA) utilizing adaptive resistance technique is proposed.

With 14% of extra power compared to typical process, applying forward bias enables to compensate temperature and skewed process effects, regaining 150mV minimum operating voltage.","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510284","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5506322/5510244/05510284.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40nm CMOS, 1.27nJ, 330mV, 600kHz, Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem 252 bits frame decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 40nm CMOS, 1.27nJ, 330mV, 600kHz, Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem 252 bits frame decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510284/","publicationDate":"June 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11417130","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40nm CMOS, 1.27nJ, 330mV, 600kHz, Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem 252 bits frame decoder","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"18SessionD142Clerc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047774S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5506322","isNumber":"5510244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5506322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5510244","articleId":"5510284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5510291,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien Clermidy","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Clermidy","id":"37319020600"},{"name":"Christian Bernard","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bernard","id":"37530508000"},{"name":"Romain Lemaire","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Lemaire","id":"37299087300"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Martin","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Martin","id":"37535187000"},{"name":"Ivan Miro-Panades","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Miro-Panades","id":"38276980400"},{"name":"Yvain Thonnart","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Yvain","lastName":"Thonnart","id":"37298712200"},{"name":"Pascal Vivet","affiliation":["LETI, MINATEC, CEA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Vivet","id":"37298711200"},{"name":"Norbert Wehn","affiliation":["University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Wehn","id":"37271665700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5775-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5773-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5774-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2381-3555"}],"articleNumber":"5510291","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":726},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","System-on-a-chip","MIMO","Baseband","Application software","Energy consumption","Pipelines","Joining processes","Software radio","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","cognitive radio","low-power electronics","network-on-chip","protocols","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAGALI","multicore system-on-chip","MIMO 4G SDR","digital baseband processing","fixed pipeline structures","3GPP-LTE","software defined radio","cognitive radio","telecommunication protocols","asynchronous network-on-chip","GOPS","dynamic reconfiguration management","distributed power management strategy","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Defined Radio","NoC","3GPP-LTE","digital baseband","reconfiguration","low-power"]}],"abstract":"Chips for digital baseband processing have long been based on simple fixed pipeline structures connecting processing elements. The emergence of complex multi-modes applications like 3GPP-LTE, Software Defined Radio or Cognitive Radio leads to fast handover need between Telecommunication protocols. On one hand, to fulfill these new requirements, more flexible architectures are required. On the other hand, such applications demand more computing performance, and thus power consumption is a concern. In this paper, we present a new chip dedicated to baseband processing. Based on an asynchronous Network-on-Chip and 23 processing units, it delivers 37 GOPS of peak performance. A dynamic reconfiguration management is deployed on the chip for fast handover between modes, with less than 50 \u03bcs of full reconfiguration. The asynchronous Network-on-Chip used to communicate allows a complete frequency decoupling between the units. A distributed power management strategy leads to less than 500 mW power consumption in typical use.","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510291","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5506322/5510244/05510291.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICDT.2010.5510291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAGALI: A Network-on-Chip based multi-core system-on-chip for MIMO 4G SDR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510291/","displayDocTitle":"MAGALI: A Network-on-Chip based multi-core system-on-chip for MIMO 4G SDR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11431533","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510291/","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAGALI: A Network-on-Chip based multi-core system-on-chip for MIMO 4G SDR","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"17SessionDClermidy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047991S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5506322","isNumber":"5510244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5506322","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5510244","articleId":"5510291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510294,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404180100"},{"name":"Ming-Dou Ker","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Dou","lastName":"Ker","id":"37270498300"},{"name":"Yuan-Wen Hsiao","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Wen","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37538001900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5775-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5773-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5774-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2381-3555"}],"articleNumber":"5510294","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge","Protection","Low-noise amplifiers","Thyristors","Radio frequency","Circuits","Stress","Robustness","CMOS technology","Clamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential amplifiers","electrostatic discharge","low noise amplifiers","thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential low-noise amplifier","cross-coupled SCR","LNA","double-diode ESD protection scheme","cross-coupled silicon-controlled rectifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510294","abstract":"A new electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection scheme for differential low-noise amplifier (LNA) was proposed in this paper.

With the new ESD protection scheme, the pin-to-pin ESD robustness can be improved, which was the most critical ESD-test pin combination for differential input pads.

In this method finding of the appropriate weights is the most important problem. The second method, which is not very well-known for power system researchers, is to optimize the objectives independently. Many optimum answers are achieved instead of a single one. These optimum results are known as Pareto front. The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are two successful approaches, which obtain the Pareto front. Nowadays, Distributed Generations (DGs) are widely used in the power systems to improve the overall conditions of the network. One of the most important issues about a DG is its optimum size and place allocation. In this paper, the two aforementioned algorithms are employed to find the optimum sizes and places of DG installation while DG cost and system total power loss are optimization objectives. These procedures give several results, which all of them are optimal and designer could select one of them according to his interest the results are compared with that of GA that optimizes weighted sum of objectives.","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510369","startPage":"240","endPage":"245","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510369.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disco planner flexible DG allocation in MV distribution networks using multi-objective optimization procedures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Power systems","Cost function","Economic forecasting","Evolutionary computation","Sorting","Genetic algorithms","Capacity planning","Substations","Power system economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disco planner flexible DG allocation","distribution network","multiobjective optimization","strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II","distributed generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Disco planner flexible DG allocation in MV distribution networks using multi-objective optimization procedures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510369/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11431624","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disco planner flexible DG allocation in MV distribution networks using multi-objective optimization procedures","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF003565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105908S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5510383,"authors":[{"name":"Damrongrit Piyabongkarn","affiliation":["Control Systems and Solutions Department, Innovation Center, Eaton Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Damrongrit (Neng) Piyabongkarn (nengPiyabongkarn@eaton.com) received the B.E. from Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, the M.S. from the University of Texas at Arlington, and the Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, all in mechanical engineering.

Three major types of ADTM devices, namely, center couplings, ELSDs, and torque-vectoring systems, were described, and the models, control system design, and limitations of each were discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11415850","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5510383/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Active driveline torque-management systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active driveline torque-management systems","sourcePdf":"30mcs04-piyabongkarn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100354S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"5510329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5510329","articleId":"5510383","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5510394,"authors":[{"name":"Dorin Petreus","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Dorin","lastName":"Petreus","id":"37394751100"},{"name":"Alin Grama","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Alin","lastName":"Grama","id":"37399314900"},{"name":"Sergiu Cadar","affiliation":["Research Institute for Analytical Instrumentation, Romania"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Cadar","id":"37543171900"},{"name":"Emil Plaian","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Plaian","id":"37543175200"},{"name":"Adina Rusu","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Adina","lastName":"Rusu","id":"37287397600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7020-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7019-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7018-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1842-0133"},{"format":"CD","value":"1842-0133"}],"articleNumber":"5510394","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"abstract":"The paper presents the design key issues for a plasma generation method. A Class E Power Amplifier is used to generate plasma at 13.56MHz with a variable load implemented with an air coil and a variable capacitor. Class E amplifier represents a mean of high efficiency power amplification. Ideal amplifiers reach 100% efficiency and by proper filtering and tuning even the real circuit efficiency can be only 5% lower. By measuring the input impedance of the matching network the resistance, the voltage and the power of the plasma torch can be estimated. In order to do that, two matching networks were designed; the first one is partially compensated and the second is completely compensated. The problems that can appear at a capacitive tuning in air and Argon atmosphere are also presented. Finally, the steps needed to design the plasma generator with class E power amplifier and air coils are described.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Power amplifiers","Impedance matching","Plasma measurements","Coils","Capacitors","High power amplifiers","Filtering","Circuit optimization","Electrical resistance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air","argon","discharges (electric)","impedance matching","plasma production","plasma torches","power amplifiers","signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance matching","plasma generation method","air coil","class E power amplifier","high efficiency power amplification","input impedance measurement","plasma torch","argon atmosphere","plasma generator design","electrical discharge","frequency 13.56 MHz","Ar"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510394","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510394.pdf","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a plasma generator based on E power amplifier and impedance matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a plasma generator based on E power amplifier and impedance matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510394/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510394/","accessionNumber":"11444803","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a plasma generator based on E power amplifier and impedance matching","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF000531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055546S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5510410,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Bai","affiliation":["School of Electronics & Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Bo Bai","id":"37535197600"},{"name":"Zhengyuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, USA"],"lastName":"Zhengyuan Xu","id":"37273448700"},{"name":"Yangyu Fan","affiliation":["School of Electronics & Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yangyu Fan","id":"37407341000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7596-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7597-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7595-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5510410","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1739},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Bandwidth","Pulse modulation","LED lamps","Fixtures","Optical fiber communication","Optical transmitters","Cost function","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light emitting diodes","optical communication","pulse position modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED dimming","high capacity visible light communication","OPPM","piggybacking communication","illumination LED","LED lighting fixture","optical communication transmitter","overlapping pulse position modulation","flicker severity index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VLC","dimming","flicker severity","cutoff data rate","power and bandwidth efficiencies"]}],"abstract":"Piggybacking communication by illumination LEDs provides additional valuable functionality to LED lighting fixtures as optical communication transmitters at little cost.

The zero-crossing of the line-to-line PM flux linkage occurs right in the middle of two commutation points, which is used as a basis for the position and speed observer. For performance applications, the position between commutation points is obtained by comparing the estimated line-to-line PM flux linkage with the FEM calculated line-to-line PM flux linkage. Even if the proposed observer relies on the fundamental model of the machine, a safe starting strategy under heavy load torque, called I-f control, is used, with seamless transition to the proposed sensorless control. The I-f starting method allows low-speed sensorless control, without knowing the initial position, and without machine parameters identification. Digital simulations and experimental results are shown, demonstrating the reliability of the FEM assisted position and speed observer for BLDC PM motor sensorless control operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion sensorless control of BLDC PM motor with offline FEM info assisted state observer","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510439","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510439.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Motion sensorless control of BLDC PM motor with offline FEM info assisted state observer","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510439/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11431598","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion sensorless control of BLDC PM motor with offline FEM info assisted state observer","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF001619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061815S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510441,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Al-Diab","affiliation":["Institute of Power System Technology and Power Mechatronics, Ruhr University of Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Al-Diab","id":"38272060000"},{"name":"Constantinos Sourkounis","affiliation":["Institute of Power System Technology and Power Mechatronics, Ruhr University of Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Sourkounis","id":"37297577700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7020-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7019-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7018-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1842-0133"},{"format":"CD","value":"1842-0133"}],"articleNumber":"5510441","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solar power generation","Power generation","Photovoltaic systems","Voltage","Algorithm design and analysis","Photovoltaic cells","Temperature sensors","Costs","Electronic equipment","Mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm","PV systems","maximum power point tracking techniques","photovoltaic system","PV array output power","solar irradiance"]}],"abstract":"Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are employed in photovoltaic (PV) systems to maximize the PV array output power which depends on solar irradiance and temperature. Among all the MPPT strategies, The P&O Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithm is mostly used, due to its ease of implementation. On the other hand, its main drawbacks are the waste of energy in steady state conditions, when the working point moves across the MPP and the poor dynamic performances exhibited when a step change in solar irradiance or in temperature occurs. In this paper, a modified variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm is proposed, the step size is automatically tuned according to the operating point. Compared with the conventional fixed step size method, the proposed approach can effectively improve the MPPT speed and efficiency simultaneously. A theoretical analysis and the design principle of the proposed algorithm are provided and its feasibility is also verified by simulation results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510441","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510441.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1102","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm for PV systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm for PV systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5510441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11431599","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510441/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable step size P&O MPPT algorithm for PV systems","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF001694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071625S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5510445,"authors":[{"name":"Marius Salagean","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Faculty of Etc, University of Politehnica Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Salagean","id":"37542146100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7020-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7019-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7018-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1842-0133"},{"format":"CD","value":"1842-0133"}],"articleNumber":"5510445","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Telecommunication traffic","Wavelet analysis","Intrusion detection","Statistical analysis","Face detection","Information security","Event detection","Electronic equipment","Network servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","security of data","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real network traffic anomaly detection","analytical discrete wavelet transform","signal processing techniques","networking security technology","high-order statistical analysis","university public server"]}],"abstract":"Signal processing techniques have attracted a lot of attention recently in the networking security technology, because of their capability of detecting novel intrusions or attacks.

The often-cited barriers of higher cost and lower reliability of the power converters are quite high if power electronics is used as direct, one-to-one, replacement for the existing electromechanical equipment. However, if the whole power distribution system were designed as a system of controllable converters, the overall system cost and reliability could actually improve, as is currently the case at low power levels within computer and telecom equipment. Starting from the example of a computer power system, the paper contemplates possible future ac and dc electronic power distribution system architectures, especially in the presence of renewable energy sources. The proposed nanogrid-microgrid-...-grid structure achieves hierarchical dynamic decoupling of generation, distribution, and consumption by using bidirectional converters as energy control centers. This is illustrated by the description and simulation of static and dynamic operation of a dc nanogrid in a hypothetical future sustainable home. Several ideas for modeling, analysis, and system-level design of such systems, including power flow control, protection, stability, and subsystem interactions, are presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510477.pdf","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510477","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future electronic power distribution systems a contemplative view","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510477/","displayDocTitle":"Future electronic power distribution systems a contemplative view","htmlLink":"/document/5510477/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11431652","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future electronic power distribution systems a contemplative view","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF007137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122596S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510481,"authors":[{"name":"Dan M.

In order to maximize energy efficiency, the US appliance industry has increasingly adopted, over the last decade, variable speed motor technology. State of the art solutions employing high-efficiency brushless (BL) permanent magnet (PM) motors and power-electronics drives are described. These include a variety of types, such as scalar voltage-regulated BLDC and vector controlled current-regulated BLAC. The motors comprise surface PM or interior PM (IPM) rotors and 3-phase stators with distributed or concentrated windings. Single-phase low power applications are also discussed. The review covers a wide range of power between 0.002 hp and 5 hp at relatively low speeds suitable for fans and blowers and higher speeds specific to pumps and compressors. A discussion of the trends and anticipated developments is also included.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510481.pdf","startPage":"1403","endPage":"1414","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-efficiency variable-speed electric motor drive technologies for energy savings in the US residential sector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric motors","Permanent magnet motors","Energy consumption","Energy efficiency","Home appliances","Brushless motors","Voltage control","Magnetic variables control","Rotors","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","machine vector control","permanent magnet motors","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-speed electric motor drive","US residential sector","electricity consumption","brushless permanent magnet motors","power electronic drives","BLDC","vector controlled current-regulated BLAC","3-phase stator","compressor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High efficiency","energy savings","electric motor","ECM","IPM","brushless DC","brushless AC","variable speed drive","power electronics","home appliances","blower","fan","HVAC","refrigerator","pump","compressor","energy storage","smart grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"High-efficiency variable-speed electric motor drive technologies for energy savings in the US residential sector","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510481/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11417281","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-efficiency variable-speed electric motor drive technologies for energy savings in the US residential sector","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF007064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085787S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510500,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The image based control structure uses the optical flow algorithm for motion detection of an object in a visual scene. Because the optical flow is very sensitive to changes in illumination or to the quality of the video, it was necessary to use median filtering and erosion and dilatation morphological operations for the decrease of erroneous blobs residing in individual frames. Since the image coordinates of the object are subjected to noise, the Kalman filtering technique is adopted for robust estimation. A fuzzy controller based on the fuzzy condensed algorithm allows real time work for each captured frame.

Instead of the circuit complex model, reduction of the computing effort implies using a macromodel capable to capture the behaviors of the original circuit while preserving its essential properties. Building such a model is based on a simplified and unitary description of the circuit, by establishing a simple relationship between the input/output variables. In this paper, the model order reduction techniques based on method projection in Krylov subspace are presented in two implementation: on state equations and on semi-sate equations of the analog circuits. Illustrative simulations are performed that allow a comparison of the standard methods based on Pad\u00e9 approximation with Krylov subspace methods, and some important conclusions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAD of MIMO systems by reduced order modeling","publicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510554","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 12th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507484/5510324/05510554.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2010.5510554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510324","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"CAD of MIMO systems by reduced order modeling","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510554/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11431630","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAD of MIMO systems by reduced order modeling","confLoc":"Brasov, Romania","sourcePdf":"RF005088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077381S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507484","isNumber":"5510324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507484","xplore-issue":"5510324","articleId":"5510554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5510568,"authors":[{"name":"Ion Boldea","affiliation":["Politechnica University of Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Boldea","id":"37270081900"},{"name":"Marcel Topor","affiliation":["Politechnica University of Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Topor","id":"38364529400"},{"name":"Fabrizio Marignetti","affiliation":["University of Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Marignetti","id":"37270209000"},{"name":"Sorin Ioan Deaconu","affiliation":["Politechnica University of Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Sorin Ioan","lastName":"Deaconu","id":"37398183600"},{"name":"Lucian Nicolae Tutelea","affiliation":["Politechnica University of Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian Nicolae","lastName":"Tutelea","id":"37293944200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7020-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7019-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7018-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1842-0133"},{"format":"CD","value":"1842-0133"}],"articleNumber":"5510568","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous machines","Circuit topology","Torque control","Analytical models","Circuit simulation","Production","Vehicle dynamics","Stator cores","Hybrid electric vehicles","Stator windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless machines","finite element analysis","machine vector control","permanent magnet machines","stators","synchronous machines","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single stator dual PM rotor","synchronous machine","3D FEM analysis","torque production","brushless stator","axial-air-gap machine","vector control","hybrid electric vehicles"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel brushless, single winding and single stator, dual PM rotor axial-air-gap machine capable to deliver independently torque at the two rotors by adequate vector control.

In this paper, we divide given sequences into two or more subsequences and then combine them together in order to find better multiple sequence alignments by applying a new GA based approach to the combined sequences. We also introduce new ways of generating an initial population and of applying the genetic operators. We have carried out experiments for the BAliBASE benchmark database using the sum of pair objective function with the PAM250 score matrix. To evaluate our proposed approach, we have compared with well known methods such as T-Coffee, MUSCLE, MAFFT and ProbCons. The experimental results show that better multiple sequence alignments may be obtained with higher number of divisions, however the computation time increases with the number of decompositions. The overall performance of the proposed Decomposition with GA (DGA) method is better than the existing methods and the GA method (without decompositions).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510595/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11417010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510595/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DGA: Decomposition with genetic algorithm for multiple sequence alignment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DGA: Decomposition with genetic algorithm for multiple sequence alignment","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"paper08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133312S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5504578","isNumber":"5510319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5504578","xplore-issue":"5510319","articleId":"5510595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510601,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Zou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, USA"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Zou","id":"37534410900"},{"name":"Yu-Dong Yao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, USA"],"firstName":"Yu-Dong","lastName":"Yao","id":"37275325500"},{"name":"Baoyu Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Baoyu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37272833700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7596-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7597-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7595-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5510601","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","Cognitive radio","Phase detection","Closed-form solution","AWGN","Performance analysis","System performance","Frequency","Computer networks","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","data transmission tradeoff","cognitive radio network","cognitive source node","cognitive transmission process","spectrum hole detection phase","outage probability","channel outage","spectrum hole utilization efficiency","time duration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","tradeoff","cognitive transmission","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, a cognitive source node typically requires two essential phases to complete a cognitive transmission process: the phase of spectrum sensing with a certain time duration to detect a spectrum hole (thus also referred to as spectrum hole detection phase) and the phase of data transmission through the detected spectrum hole. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of cognitive transmissions by jointly considering the two phases. An exact closed-form expression of an overall outage probability that accounts for both the probability of no spectrum hole detected and the probability of a channel outage is derived for cognitive transmissions. Based on the derived overall outage probability, we investigate the spectrum hole utilization efficiency, which is used to quantify the percentage of spectrum holes utilized by the cognitive source for its successful data transmission. Numerical results show that there is a tradeoff in determining the time durations for hole detection and data transmission phases in order to maximize the spectrum hole utilization efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2010.5510601","displayPublicationTitle":"The 19th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507485/5510409/05510601.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2010.5510601","publicationTitle":"The 19th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC 2010)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing and data transmission tradeoff in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing and data transmission tradeoff in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510601/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510601/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11431675","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","conferenceDate":"14-15 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing and data transmission tradeoff in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"WOCC2010Papers01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092075S","chronDate":"14-15 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507485","isNumber":"5510409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507485","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5510409","articleId":"5510601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5510607,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539855500"},{"name":"Char-Dir Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Char-Dir","lastName":"Chung","id":"37334648000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7596-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7597-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7595-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5510607","dbTime":"51 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Power engineering and energy","Bit error rate","Fading","Throughput","Discrete Fourier transforms","Power system modeling","Adaptive systems","Frequency modulation","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","fading channels","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive spectrally precoded OFDM","cyclic prefix","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","adaptive modulation scheme","flat fading channel","average spectral efficiency","ASPCP-OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","cyclic prefix","spectral precoding","average spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive spectrally precoded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ASP-OFDM) is a recently proposed adaptive modulation scheme to significantly improve the system throughput in adaptive OFDM applications.

First, the bits with the least cost in each subchannel are formulated as a possible solution with a predefined probability. Then a genetic-like algorithm is used to search the current local optima, which have the most allocated bits. The algorithm terminates until the total power is consumed or the mutual interference is over-the-threshold.

Recently, the constellation extended scheme (CES) is an active technique for reducing PAPR of OFDM signals. However, this approach needs high computational load and more inverse Fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operations for finding the transmitted signal with minimum PAPR out. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified CES with lower computational load and IFFT operations than the CES in a 16-QAM OFDM system. Our proposed method, which combines the CES with the partial transmit sequences (PTS) technique, is also called CES-PTS. When compared to PTS techniques, our proposed method has no need to transmit side information in the transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 19th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications

access control (MAC) protocols can be classified as contention based or controlled based according to their transmission mechanisms. To classify contention based or control based MAC protocols in an unknown primary network, we choose received power mean and variance as two features for support vector machines (SVMs) in a machine learning based algorithm. The data consisting of these two features are collected from two primary network models based on time division multiple access (control based) and slotted Aloha (contention based), respectively. In the training process, data along with their identification class labels (say, 1 denotes time division multiple access, and -1 stands for slotted Aloha) are used to train the SVMs. After training, contention or control based MAC protocols can be effectively determined by the trained SVMs embedded in a cognitive radio terminal of a secondary network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11431691","htmlLink":"/document/5510617/","conferenceDate":"14-15 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"MAC protocol classification in a cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC protocol classification in a cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"WOCC2010Papers17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067812S","chronDate":"14-15 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507485","isNumber":"5510409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507485","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5510409","articleId":"5510617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510632,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Hong Jiang","id":"37272626400"},{"name":"De-Fa Wang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"De-Fa Wang","id":"37405358500"},{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Chang Liu","id":"37406615200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7596-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7597-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7595-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5510632","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["US Department of Defense","MIMO","Radar polarimetry","Radar antennas","Electromagnetic wave polarization","Spaceborne radar","Radar tracking","Electromagnetic scattering","Transmitters","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOD estimation","direction-of-departures","2D-DOA","two-dimensional direction-of-arrivals","polarizations","bistatic MIMO radar","multiple-input multiple-output radar system","multi-parameter estimation","target discrimination","M-element uniform linear array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","multiple parameter estimation","polarization","two-dimensional direction-of-arrival","direction-of-departure"]}],"abstract":"Multi-parameter estimation is investigated for target discrimination and localization in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system.

In this paper, we incorporate our ordering schemes with the K-Best detector, which is a near-ML detector and is particularly suitable for hardware implementation. Our simulation results show that our ordering schemes greatly improve the reliability of the K-Best detector. Given a fixed detection error rate, our ordering schemes either result in SNR gains or enable the usage of even smaller K, thereby leading to small area and power consumption and higher throughput for their hardware implementations.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2010.5510636","publicationTitle":"The 19th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 19th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507485/5510409/05510636.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2010.5510636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Reliability of the K-Best algorithm for MIMO detection with ordering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510636/","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Reliability of the K-Best algorithm for MIMO detection with ordering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11431706","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510636/","conferenceDate":"14-15 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Reliability of the K-Best algorithm for MIMO detection with ordering","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"WOCC2010Papers78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066571S","chronDate":"14-15 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507485","isNumber":"5510409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507485","xplore-issue":"5510409","articleId":"5510636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5510645,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuhong Long","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Xiuhong Long","id":"37409122400"},{"name":"Fanxin Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Fanxin Zeng","id":"37279835500"},{"name":"Wenchao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Wenchao Zhang","id":"37404212600"},{"name":"Chengchao Sun","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Chengchao Sun","id":"37537141700"},{"name":"Liang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chongqing Communication Institute, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Liang Guo","id":"38001602100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7596-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7597-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7595-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5510645","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"Complementary sequences are well studied in the communication field for their good correlation properties.

Such systems use two phases - a relay selection phase, in which the system uses transmission time and energy to select the best relay, and a data transmission phase, in which it uses the spatial diversity benefits of selection to transmit data. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the overall throughput and energy consumption, and study the time and energy trade-off between the selection and data transmission phases. To this end, we analyze a baseline non-adaptive system and several adaptive systems that adapt the selection phase, relay transmission power, or transmission time. Our results show that while selection yields significant benefits, the selection phase's time and energy overhead can be significant. In fact, at the optimal point, the selection can be far from perfect, and depends on the number of relays and the mode of adaptation. The results also provide guidelines about the optimal system operating point for different modes of adaptation. The analysis also sheds new insights on the fast splitting-based algorithm considered in this paper for relay selection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Relay Selection and Transmission Trade-off in Cooperative Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.070710.090487","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5546321/05510766.pdf","startPage":"2505","endPage":"2515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.070710.090487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5546321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"The Relay Selection and Transmission Trade-off in Cooperative Communication Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5510766/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11472536","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Relay Selection and Transmission Trade-off in Cooperative Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"2505-tw1008-shah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14508S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5546321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5546321","articleId":"5510766","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5510768,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy Abdallah Tannious","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Compute Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5510768/5510768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ramy Abdallah Tannious received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Alexandria University, Egypt, in 1999 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Texas at Dallas, TX, in 2008, all in Electrical Engineering.

This can be accomplished with an oblivious primary system and without assuming any non-causal information at the secondary about the primary data. Several protocols are devised that work with varying amounts of channel state information about the cognitive and primary links. The protocols are further extended to the scenario where multiple cognitive receivers exist. Performance analysis of the protocols is presented and their effectiveness is verified via simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Protocols Based on Exploiting Hybrid ARQ Retransmissions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.091162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05510768.pdf","startPage":"2833","endPage":"2841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.091162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Protocols Based on Exploiting Hybrid ARQ Retransmissions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5510768/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527907","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Protocols Based on Exploiting Hybrid ARQ Retransmissions","sourcePdf":"2833-tw1009-abdallah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073829S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510768","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510770,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang D.

The optimal training sequence for channel estimation in spatially correlated MIMO-OFDM systems was not known for an arbitrary signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Only one class of training sequences was proposed in the literature in which the power allocation is given only for the extreme conditions of low and high SNRs. The current paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal training sequence, and reformulates the training design problem as a convex optimization problem whose optimal solution is efficiently solved. In addition, tight upper bounds for MMSE and resulting low complexity iterative algorithms with the closed-form expression in iterations to find the optimum training sequence are derived. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed design over the existing one in terms of both MSE estimation and BER performance. The proposed methods are also shown to be robust with respect to the spatial correlation mismatch at the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.070710.081601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05510770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.070710.081601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","startPage":"2768","endPage":"2778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Training Sequences for Spatially Correlated MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Training Sequences for Spatially Correlated MIMO-OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527912","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5510770/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Training Sequences for Spatially Correlated MIMO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"2768-tw1009-tuan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0953S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510770","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510771,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Morgado","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Camino Del Molino, Rey Juan Carlos University, Fuenlabrada, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5546321/5510771/5510771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eduardo Morgado received a degree in telecommunication engineering from the University Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, in 2004 and the PhD degree from the University Rey Juan Carlos, Spain, in 2009.

We provide an analytical recursive expression for the most generic case of any number of hops and any single-hop ABER for every hop in the route. Then, we solve the recursive relationship in two scenarios to obtain simple expressions for the end-to-end ABER, namely: (a) The simplest case, where all the relay channels have identical statistical behaviour; (b) The most general case, where every relay channel has a different statistical behaviour. Along with the theoretical proofs, we test our results against simulations. We then use the previous results to obtain closed analytical expressions for the end-to-end ABER considering DAF relays over Nakagami-m fading channels and with various modulation schemes. We compare these results with the corresponding expressions for Amplify-and-Forward (AAF) and, after corroborating the theoretical results with simulations, we conclude that DAF strategy is more advantageous than the AAF over Nakagami-m fading channels as both the number of relays and m-index increase.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5546321/05510771.pdf","startPage":"2478","endPage":"2487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.070710.090240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.070710.090240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5546321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Average BER in Multihop Wireless Networks over Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Fading","Decoding","Digital relays","Testing","Error analysis","Batteries","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Nakagami channels","radio networks","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end average bit error rate","multihop wireless networks","Nakagami-m fading channels","multihop decode-and-forward routes","identical statistical behaviour","amplify-and-forward"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate","end-to-end performance","decode and forward","amplify and forward","fading channel","multihop wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Average BER in Multihop Wireless Networks over Fading Channels","volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5510771/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11472540","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Average BER in Multihop Wireless Networks over Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2478-tw1008-morgado.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084124S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5546321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5546321","articleId":"5510771","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510772,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Pompili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5510772/5510772-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dario Pompili joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, as Assistant Professor in Fall 2007.

Because of the different application requirements, there is a need to provide differentiated-service support to delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant data traffic as well as to loss-sensitive and loss-tolerant traffic. While research on underwater communication protocol design so far has followed the traditional layered approach originally developed for wired networks, improved performance can be obtained with a cross-layer design. Hence, the objective of this work is twofold: (1) study the interactions of key underwater communication functionalities such as modulation, forward error correction, medium access control, and routing; and (2) develop a distributed cross-layer communication solution that allows multiple devices to efficiently and fairly share the bandwidth-limited high-delay underwater acoustic medium.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Acoustic sensors","Underwater communication","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","Sea measurements","Surveillance","Access

beamforming is an approach where sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network, deployed randomly in an area of interest, transmit a common message by forming a beampattern towards a destination. Previous statistical analysis of the averaged power beampattern considered multipath-free conditions. Herein, we express the averaged power beampattern when the signal is observed at the destination in the presence of local scattering. Assuming the spreading angles are uniformly distributed around the destination direction, we derive closed-form expressions for the maximum gain and numerically examine the beamwidth as a function of the number of nodes, the cluster size, and the scattering parameters, for node positions with a uniform distribution or a Gaussian distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527910","htmlLink":"/document/5510773/","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Local Scattering on the Gain and Beamwidth of a Collaborative Beampattern for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Local Scattering on the Gain and Beamwidth of a Collaborative Beampattern for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"2730-tw1009-amar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071675S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510773","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5510775,"authors":[{"name":"Hun Seok Kim","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5510775/5510775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hun Seok Kim was born in Jeju, South Korea.

We formulate the link adaptation problem as a convex optimization problem and expand the set of parameters under the control of the link adaptation protocol to include: number of spatial streams, number of transmit/receive antennas, use of spatial multiplexing or space time block coding (STBC), constellation size, bandwidth, transmit power and choice of maximum likelihood (ML) or zero-forcing (ZF) for MIMO decoding. Additionally, we increase the fidelity of the energy consumption modeling relative to the prior art. The resulting solution allows us to easily and quickly search the space of possible system parameters to deliver on the QoS with minimal energy consumption. Moreover, it provides us insight into where crossovers occur in the choice of the radio parameters. Application of the results to a generic MIMO-OFDM radio shows that the proposed strategy can provide an order of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency or data throughput relative to a static strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.090983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05510775.pdf","startPage":"2820","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.090983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Constrained Link Adaptation for MIMO OFDM Wireless Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Constrained Link Adaptation for MIMO OFDM Wireless Communication Systems","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527916","htmlLink":"/document/5510775/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Constrained Link Adaptation for MIMO OFDM Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"2820-tw1009-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093919S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510775","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510776,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Baldo","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f3gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5546321/5510776/5510776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Baldo (S'07, M'10) was born in Rovigo, Italy, in 1981.

It addresses the following important aspects of opportunistic spectrum access: 1) implementation of the control channel, 2) multi-channel medium access control, 3) primary user detection, and 4) secondary reuse of spectrum unused by primary users. The main features of the scheme are that it is completely distributed, it does not need dedicated spectrum resources for control purposes, but rather leverages on a virtual control channel which is implemented using Network Coding techniques, and it exploits a cooperative detection strategy to identify unused spectrum. Due to these aspects, our proposal represents a significant improvement with respect to existing Dynamic Spectrum Access solutions. We carry out an evaluation study of the proposed solution to assess its performance with respect to different system and scenario parameters; the obtained results show that the proposed solution is feasible, capable of providing satisfactory performance, and suitable for implementation in real systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","volume":"9","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"11472542","publicationDate":"August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510776/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Using a Network Coded Cognitive Control Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access Using a Network Coded Cognitive Control Channel","sourcePdf":"2575-tw1008-baldo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072834S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5546321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5546321","articleId":"5510776","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5510778,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangwei Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5510778/5510778-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangwei Zhou received his B.S. degree in 2001 from the School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Techniques, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, and his M.S. degree in 2005 from the Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach as well as its advantage over conventional approaches that rely upon the hard decisions on channel availability.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.070610.091511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05510778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.070610.091511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","startPage":"2870","endPage":"2879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Resource Allocation for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Resource Allocation for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527918","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5510778/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Resource Allocation for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"2870-tw1009-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158272S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510778","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5510779,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper, closed form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems employing ML based decode and forward (DF) cooperative diversity are obtained. The DF operation at the relay intelligently employs the multiple antennas available at the relay for receive diversity on the source-relay link and space-time coding (STC) on the relay-destination link resulting in an extension of the ML detection rule for SISO systems to MIMO systems as well. For the piecewise linear (PL) approximation to the ML detector, exact expressions for the BER are obtained for single-relay systems with both the source and relay supporting multiple antennas. For a multirelay system, each relay having multiple antennas, approximate expressions for the BER are obtained. This is done by finding the statistics of conditionally Gaussian (CG) random variables, that appear in the decision variable. Through numerical results obtained from the BER expressions, it is shown that using multiple antennas at the source as well as the relay leads to significant improvement in BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.091583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05510779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.091583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","startPage":"2880","endPage":"2889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Detection for Decode and Forward MIMO Relay Channels in Rayleigh Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Detection for Decode and Forward MIMO Relay Channels in Rayleigh Fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527921","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5510779/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Detection for Decode and Forward MIMO Relay Channels in Rayleigh Fading","sourcePdf":"2880-tw1009-sharma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09021S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510779","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510780,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5510780/5510780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Yang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and information science from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China in 2004.

We use a multi-dimensional Markov chain to model the medium access control layer behavior. The state of the Markov chain represents current queue lengths. Our goal is to minimize the average packet delay through controlling the probability of departure at each state, while satisfying the average power constraint for each queue. We consider a general asymmetric system, where the arrival rates to the queues, channel gains and average power constraints of the two users are arbitrary. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem, and then transform it to a linear programming problem. We analyze the linear programming problem, and develop a procedure by which we determine the optimal solution analytically. We show that the optimal policy has a threshold structure: when the sum of the queue lengths is larger than a threshold, both users should transmit a packet during the current slot; when the sum of the queue lengths is smaller than a threshold, only one of the users, the one with the longer queue, should transmit a packet during the current slot. We provide numerical examples for both symmetric and asymmetric settings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05510780.pdf","startPage":"2754","endPage":"2767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.081209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.062910.081209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Minimal Transmission for Average Power Constrained Multi-Access Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Transmitters","Communication system control","Wireless communication","Media Access Protocol","Linear programming","Resource management","Information theory","Queueing analysis","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","Markov processes","multi-access systems","probability","queueing theory","radio networks","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-minimal transmission","average power constraints","transmitters","multiaccess wireless communication","multidimensional Markov chain","medium access control layer behavior","average packet delay","departure probability","asymmetric system","channel gains","constrained optimization problem","linear programming problem","threshold structure","queue lengths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay minimization","multi-access communication","medium-access control","queue control","power allocation","cross-layer design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Minimal Transmission for Average Power Constrained Multi-Access Communications","volume":"9","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5510780/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527923","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Minimal Transmission for Average Power Constrained Multi-Access Communications","sourcePdf":"2754-tw1009-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083133S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5510780","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5510783,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yue","affiliation":["University of Electro-Communications, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5510783/5510783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Yue was born in Sichuan province of P.

However, MUI-free transmission is guaranteed only when the data length D, channel delay L, and ZCZ length Z satisfy Z+1 \u2265 D + L. In this paper, we consider the situation that MUI-free transmission is not realized inevitably because of excessive multipath delays or deliberately because of the necessity to get a higher bandwidth efficiency, clarify the structure of MUI in the CS-CDMA/CP system employing M-ZCZ codes, and propose iterative partial multiuser detection (IPMUD). The detection is implemented at symbol-level (after despreading) and the number of users jointly considered can be adjusted flexibly to offer a tradeoff between system performance and receiver complexity. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified numerically by density evolution approach and BER simulations. The CS-CDMA/CP system with IPMUD is shown to be much less complex than the DS-CDMA system with Wang and Poor's turbo MUD receiver and to be less complex and better, in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance, than the DS-CDMA system with iterative chip-wise equalization receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.062510.080650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05510783.pdf","startPage":"2305","endPage":"2313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.062510.080650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Multiuser Detection for CS-CDMA/CP over Multipath Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510783/","displayDocTitle":"Partial Multiuser Detection for CS-CDMA/CP over Multipath Channels","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487101","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510783/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Multiuser Detection for CS-CDMA/CP over Multipath Channels","sourcePdf":"2305-tc1008-yue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1249S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5510783","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510784,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Persson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5510784/5510784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Persson was born in Halmstad, Sweden, in 1977.

The suggested scheme is shown to increase performance compared with previous state-of-the-art MDC methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05510784.pdf","startPage":"2242","endPage":"2251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.070610.080689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.070610.080689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Multiple Description Coding of Sources with Memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation losses","Forward error correction","Source coding","Vector quantization","Decoding","Pulse modulation","Computational complexity","Automatic repeat request","Speech","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantisation (signal)","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple description coding","memory","source coding method","correlated sources lossless transmission","power series quantization","PSQ","linear predictor","nonlinear predictor","quantizer","MDC methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel-optimized quantization","packet erasure channel","memory-based quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"On Multiple Description Coding of Sources with Memory","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5510784/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487086","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Multiple Description Coding of Sources with Memory","sourcePdf":"2242-tc1008-persson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081496S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5510784","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510785,"authors":[{"name":"Hyo-Jin Lee","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea","Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyo-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336509900"},{"name":"Dong-Min Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Min","lastName":"Shin","id":"37533901200"},{"name":"Kyeongcheol Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongcheol","lastName":"Yang","id":"37334970200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5510785","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper we first analyze some mathematical properties of ergodic capacity and outage capacity functions of the layers in Bell labs layered space-time (BLAST) architectures employing successive decoding and interference cancellation.

Since the methods are developed by using ergodic capacity and outage capacity functions of the layers, the allocated rates and powers depend only on a given channel statistic. Finally, we prove that the rate allocation yields a better asymptotic performance than the power allocation. Numerical results show that BLAST architectures with the rate and power allocation perform better by 4 dB and 3 dB, respectively, than a BLAST architecture with the same rate and power in all layers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05510785.pdf","startPage":"2212","endPage":"2218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.062510.090120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.062510.090120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Performance Analysis of Coded BLAST Architectures with Statistical Rate and Power Allocations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","MIMO","Feedback","Statistics","Silicon carbide","Interference cancellation","Parity check codes","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Pulse modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","mathematical analysis","MIMO communication","parity check codes","space-time codes","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded BLAST architectures","power allocation methods","ergodic capacity mathematical properties","outage capacity functions","Bell labs layered space-time architectures","successive decoding","interference cancellation","statistical rate allocation","channel statistics","low-density parity-check code","LDPC code","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ergodic capacity","layered architecture","low-density parity-check (LDPC) code","multiple antennas","outage capacity","power allocation","rate allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Performance Analysis of Coded BLAST Architectures with Statistical Rate and Power Allocations","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5510785/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487107","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Performance Analysis of Coded BLAST Architectures with Statistical Rate and Power Allocations","sourcePdf":"2212-tc1008-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061247S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5510785","onlineDate":"15 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5510913,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chi Zhang (zhangchi@ufl.edu) is a Ph.D. candidate in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville.

While data outsourcing relieves the owners of the burden of local data storage and maintenance, it also eliminates their physical control of storage dependability and security, which traditionally has been expected by both enterprises and individuals with high service-level requirements. In order to facilitate rapid deployment of cloud data storage service and regain security assurances with outsourced data dependability, efficient methods that enable on-demand data correctness verification on behalf of cloud data owners have to be designed. In this article we propose that publicly auditable cloud data storage is able to help this nascent cloud economy become fully established. With public auditability, a trusted entity with expertise and capabilities data owners do not possess can be delegated as an external audit party to assess the risk of outsourced data when needed. Such an auditing service not only helps save data owners\u00bf computation resources but also provides a transparent yet cost-effective method for data owners to gain trust in the cloud. We describe approaches and system requirements that should be brought into consideration, and outline challenges that need to be resolved for such a publicly auditable secure cloud storage service to become a reality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/5510907/05510914.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2010.5510914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2010.5510914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510907","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5510914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward publicly auditable secure cloud data storage services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory","Secure storage","Data security","Cloud computing","Computer vision","Cryptography","Outsourcing","Protocols","Risk management","Data storage systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","information storage","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["publicly auditable secure cloud data storage services","cloud computing","high service-level requirements","security assurances","outsourced data dependability","data correctness verification","system requirements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward publicly auditable secure cloud data storage services","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5510914/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-August 2010","accessionNumber":"11416738","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward publicly auditable secure cloud data storage services","sourcePdf":"007RENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04957S","chronDate":"July-August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5510907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"5510907","articleId":"5510914","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5510927,"authors":[{"name":"Muzaffer O.

Traditionally, inter-chip and intra-chip communication architectures are separately designed to maximize design flexibility under different constraints. However, jointly designing communication architectures for both inter-chip and intra-chip communication could potentially yield better solutions. In this paper, we present a unified inter/intra-chip optical network, called UNION, for chip multiprocessors (CMP). UNION is based on recent progress in nano-photonic technologies. It connects not only processors on a single CMP but also multiple CMPs in a system. UNION employs a hierarchical optical network to separate inter-chip communication traffic from intra-chip communication traffic. It fully utilizes a single optical network to transmit both payload packets and control packets. The network controller on each CMP not only manages intra-chip communications but also collaborate with each other to facilitate inter-chip communications.

Memristors are used as weights at the inputs of the threshold gates. The threshold gates are programmed by changing the memristance to enable implementation of different Boolean functions. A new threshold gate-array architecture is proposed and evaluated for power, area and delay metrics. The CAD setup that was utilized in the evaluation of the aforementioned architecture, can also be used to analyse the performance of emerging computing technologies. The proposed architecture achieves an average power reduction of 75% and area (transistor count) reduction of 75% when compared to look-up-table (LUT) based logic with some delay penalty.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2010.5510933","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","pdfPath":"/iel5/5506521/5510921/05510933.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2010.5510933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor based programmable threshold logic array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Memristor based programmable threshold logic array","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11432478","htmlLink":"/document/5510933/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","conferenceDate":"17-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor based programmable threshold logic array","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp03137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070837S","chronDate":"17-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5506521","isNumber":"5510921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5506521","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5510921","articleId":"5510933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5510936,"authors":[{"name":"Robinson E.

From a microprocessor design view point, it is important to be able to simulate large numbers of devices within the integrated circuit architecture in order to speed up reliably the development process. Ideally, device models would accurately describe the characteristic device behavior and would be represented by single-valued equations without requiring the need for recursive or numerically intensive solutions. With this in mind, we have developed an empirical chalcogenide compact memristor model that accurately describes all regions of operations of memristor devices employing single-valued equations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5510936/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5510936/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11432481","conferenceDate":"17-18 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compact method for modeling and simulation of memristor devices: Ion conductor chalcogenide-based memristor devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact method for modeling and simulation of memristor devices: Ion conductor chalcogenide-based memristor devices","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp02144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04674S","chronDate":"17-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5506521","isNumber":"5510921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5506521","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5510921","articleId":"5510936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5511185,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Different from the traditional methods, the edge detection problem in this paper was formulated as an optimization process that sought the edge points to minimize an energy function. The dynamics of Hopfield neural networks were applied to solve the optimization problem. An initial edge was first estimated by the method of traditional edge algorithm. The gray value of image pixel was described as the neuron state of Hopfield neural network. The state updated till the energy function touch the minimum value. The final states of neurons were the result image of edge detection. The novel energy function ensured that the network converged and reached a near-optimal solution. Taking advantage of the collective computational ability and energy convergence capability of the Hopfield network, the noises will be effectively removed. The experimental results showed that our method can obtain more vivid and more accurate edge than the traditional methods of edge detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512014","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512014.pdf","startPage":"1942","endPage":"1946","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on wood image edge detection based on Hopfield neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Study on wood image edge detection based on Hopfield neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11417420","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5512014/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on wood image edge detection based on Hopfield neural network","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065965S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5512021,"authors":[{"name":"Baoguo Yang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Baoguo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37533143000"},{"name":"Tan Tian","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Tian","id":"37545583300"},{"name":"Dianlun Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Dianlun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537308100"},{"name":"Dajun Sun","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Dajun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37067247200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512021","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic resonance","Strontium","Acoustical engineering","Nonlinear systems","Signal processing","Gaussian noise","Arithmetic","Acoustic signal detection","Underwater tracking","Underwater acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incoherent correlation detection method","stochastic resonance beam forming","bistable stochastic resonance system","single frequency signal","matched filter","frequency hopping signal pulse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stochastic resonance","incoherence","antireverberation","underwater acoustics imaging"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of incoherent correlation detection method in stochastic resonance beam-forming","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","endPage":"1890","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512021.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512021","startPage":"1887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512021","abstract":"At first, the basic principle and numerical method of bi-stable stochastic resonance (SR) system was described and the SR beam-forming method with single-frequency signal was studied to verify that the SR system could get a gain to the array element, but not with the Correlation Detection method (matched filter) be used together. Secondly, in order to use a detection algorithm, frequency-hopping signal pulse and incoherent correlation detection method were taken in this paper, which identified SR-based incoherent detection method. Finally, SR-based incoherent detection method and conventional incoherent detection method were contrasted. The simulation showed more side-lobe suppression in SR based method, and the method could enhance the target intensity effectively and be more availability than conventional incoherent in reverberation suppression was proven by the processing of sea trial data. Therefore, SR-based detection method could be used in the target detection or imaging in the background of reverberation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11417427","htmlLink":"/document/5512021/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"The application of incoherent correlation detection method in stochastic resonance beam-forming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of incoherent correlation detection method in stochastic resonance beam-forming","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056701S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5512059,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Henan Polytechnic University, JiaoZuo, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37532846800"},{"name":"Jianxun Li","affiliation":["Zhumadian Cigarette Factory, Henan Branch, China Tobacco Industry Corporation, China"],"firstName":"Jianxun","lastName":"Li","id":"37538138100"},{"name":"Weiwei Xue","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Henan Polytechnic University, JiaoZuo, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Xue","id":"37528265800"},{"name":"Rong Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Automation, Henan Polytechnic University, JiaoZuo, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37530329400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512059","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Brushless motors","Telescopes","Optical control","Control systems","Servomechanisms","Maintenance","Large-scale systems","Nonlinear optics","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical telescopes","brushless DC motors","machine control","motor drives","precision engineering","servomechanisms","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct driving brushless motor","azimuth ultra low speed tracking control","servo system","large scale optical astronomical telescope","direct drive control technology","torsional stiffness","telescopes tracking axis","pitch play","static friction torque","system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Telescope","Unit Motor","Direct Drive","Ultra Low Velocity","Cogging Torque"]}],"abstract":"In order to realize high precision control of the mount servo system for modern large-scale optical astronomical telescopes, direct drive control technology was adopted, motor was directly coupled to the load together, it saves the transmission part between them.

To solve this issue, a novel AUV localization method introducing draft depth is put forward, where vertical position of AUV relative to magnetic dipole target can be directly calculated from twice draft depth measurement. The algorithm related to the localization method is deduced theoretically and simulated numerically. These results all show that the novel localization method behaves high precision when vehicle is far away from the target. The measured errors such as draft depth and target magnetic field gradients act effect on localization accuracy. The relationship between localization precision and target distance are respectively analyzed and discussed. Based on these investigations, another possible localization method for AUV whose height relative to sea bed obtained by single measurement is brought forward and at the same time its application limitation is pointed out. We deduce and simulate an approach calculating target magnetic moment from AUV position parameters and the simulation indicates that target magnetic moment can be obtained precisely.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512104.pdf","startPage":"1357","endPage":"1362","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Method of separating dipole magnetic anomaly from geomagnetic field and application in underwater vehicle localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic separation","Geomagnetism","Underwater vehicles","Magnetic field measurement","Geologic measurements","Sea measurements","Magnetic moments","Geology","Position measurement","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geomagnetic variations","gradient methods","hydrological techniques","magnetic moments","mobile robots","position control","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole magnetic anomaly","geomagnetic feild","automatic underwater vehicle localization","AUV","draft depth","magnetic field gradient","magnetic moment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AUV Localization","geomagnetic anomaly","draft depth","gradient","magnetic moment","magnetometer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Method of separating dipole magnetic anomaly from geomagnetic field and application in underwater vehicle localization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512104/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11417490","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Method of separating dipole magnetic anomaly from geomagnetic field and application in underwater vehicle localization","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056134S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5512106,"authors":[{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"},{"name":"Xichuan Lin","affiliation":["Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Xichuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37533752600"},{"name":"Koujirou Tanaka","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Koujirou","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37538090200"},{"name":"Seji Hata","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Seji","lastName":"Hata","id":"37298341000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512106","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicles","Control systems","Motion control","Sliding mode control","Three-term control","Propulsion","Neural networks","Propellers","Automotive engineering","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","motion control","neurocontrollers","propulsion","three-term control","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vectored water-jet-based spherical underwater vehicle","vectored water-jet propulsion systems","vectored water-jet propellers","PID control","BP neural network","horizontal motion control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP Neural Networks","PID Control","Propulsion System","Vector Synthesis","Force Distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512106","abstract":"This paper presents a spherical underwater vehicle which uses three vectored water-jet propulsion systems.

However, unsatisfying tracking results may be produced due to different real-time conditions. These conditions include: inter-object occlusion, occlusion of the ocjects by background obstacles, splits and merges, which are observed when objects are being tracked in real-time. In this paper, an algorithm of feature-based using Kalman filter motion to handle multiple objects tracking is proposed. The system is fully automatic and requires no manual input of any kind for initialization of tracking. Through establishing Kalman filter motion model with the features centroid and area of moving objects in a single fixed camera monitoring scene, using information obtained by detection to judge whether merge or split occurred, the calculation of the cost function can be used to solve the problems of correspondence after split happened. The algorithm proposed is validated on human and vehicle image sequence. The results shows that the algorithm proposed achieves efficient tracking of multiple moving objects under the confusing situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512258.pdf","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1866","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple object tracking method using Kalman filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Cameras","Monitoring","Layout","Object detection","Motion detection","Cost function","Humans","Vehicles","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image sequences","Kalman filters","object detection","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object tracking method","inter-object occlusion","Kalman filter motion model","camera monitoring scene","human image sequence","vehicle image sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kalam filter","motion model","multi-object tracking","Occlusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A multiple object tracking method using Kalman filter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512258/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11432273","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple object tracking method using Kalman filter","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072614S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5512310,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-hong Xu","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, 410073, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-hong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087372949"},{"name":"Ling-li Zeng","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, 410073, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ling-li","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37087373405"},{"name":"Yue-wen Fu","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, 410073, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yue-wen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37087373529"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512310","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Linear programming","Software algorithms","Genetic mutations","NP-hard problem","Mathematical programming","Iterative algorithms","Mathematical model","Automation","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","integer programming","job shop scheduling","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible job shop scheduling problem","hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","basic particle swarm optimization algorithm","genetic algorithm","GA","object oriented programming language","hybrid integer programming model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flexible Job-shop","Scheduling","Hybrid particle swarm optimization","Simulation Software"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512310","abstract":"In this paper, a hybrid integer programming model is proposed for flexible job-shop scheduling problem(FJSP).

Because of using chirp-basis function in FRFT, this communication mode uses linear frequency modulation (LFM) as carrier signal of transmitted information, which has good anti-jamming capability. The code elements were divided into groups in time-domain and the transmitted information was decoded by using pulse position modulation (PPM) in fractional domain in this scheme. The method of inserting guard interval (GI) in transmitted signal and the Rake receiver was presented to suppress the UWA channel's multi-path effect which could lead to intersymbol interference (ISI). The information rate is up to 800 bit/s and the feasibility and the robustness of this system were validated through the experimental results, which is helpful for UWA communication of Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) in complex working environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and

used in underwater acoustic communication systems and signal detection systems. The fractional Fourier transform is an effective transform manner to analyse non-stationary signals especially to detect linear frequency modulation signals. The time measurement manner can be changed into frequency measurement manner by employing fractional Fourier transform to detect linear frequency signals. In the receiver, we acquire time domain data of transmitted signal by measuring u-domain peak position of detected signal. Then we can find the beginning of transmitted signal. To enhance the time measurement precision of this manner, we truncate some points of transmitted signal in the transmitter to make the u-domain peak position shift susceptive. This paper mainly simulates target trajectory tracking under underwater acoustic condition. We overlap several truncated linear frequency modulation signals to transmit. Using the fractional Fourier transform to detect linear frequency modulation signals, to acquire the time delay between targets and transducer arrays. Target bearing is resolved by hyperboloid intersection algorithm to track trajectory of the target.","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512375","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512375.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The applications of fractional Fourier transform in underwater acoustic trajectory tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512375/","displayDocTitle":"The applications of fractional Fourier transform in underwater acoustic trajectory tracking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11432348","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512375/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The applications of fractional Fourier transform in underwater acoustic trajectory tracking","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050443S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5512376,"authors":[{"name":"Shane Dixon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Louis Obispo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Dixon","id":"37530855700"},{"name":"Xiao-Hua Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Louis Obispo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao-Hua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37336986000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512376","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bioinformatics","Data mining","Artificial immune systems","Artificial neural networks","Research and development","Databases","Information analysis","Pattern analysis","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","bioinformatics","data mining","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics data mining","artificial immune systems","artificial neural networks","biomedical analysis","multilayer feedforward neural network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial immune systems","Real-valued negative selection algorithm","Data mining","Artificial neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512376","abstract":"Bioinformatics is a data-intensive field of research and development.

While most of the studies so far focus on the prominent Gaussian random measurements, we investigate the performances of matrices with Bernoulli distribution. As extensions of symmetric signs ensemble, random binary ensemble and semi-Hadamard ensemble are proposed as sensing matrices with simplex structures. Based on some results of symmetric signs ensemble and the concept of compressed sensing matrices, we obtain a theoretical result that signal compressed sensing using random binary matrices can be exactly reconstructed with high probability. In reconstruction processes, the fast and low-consumed orthogonal matching pursuit is adopted. Numerical results show that such matrices perform equally well to the Gaussian matrices.","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512379","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","startPage":"455","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing and reconstruction with bernoulli matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing and reconstruction with bernoulli matrices","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512379/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11432352","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5512379/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing and reconstruction with bernoulli matrices","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053795S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5512386,"authors":[{"name":"Li Luo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Luo","id":"37404189400"},{"name":"Hongjun He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"He","id":"37404582900"},{"name":"Chunke Liao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Chunke","lastName":"Liao","id":"37399422200"},{"name":"Qiang Dou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Dou","id":"37396376900"},{"name":"Weixia Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Weixia","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404295600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512386","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Multicore processing","Particle swarm optimization","Cloning","Partitioning algorithms","Software algorithms","System-on-a-chip","Genetic algorithms","Software performance","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","hardware-software codesign","multiprocessing systems","particle swarm optimisation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software partitioning","hardware partitioning","multicore SOC","particle swarm optimization and immune clone","PSO-IC","hardware-software codesign flow","NP-hard problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware/software partitioning","heterogeneous multicore SOC (system on a chip)","genetic algorithm (GA)","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","immune clone(IC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512386","abstract":"Hardware/Software partitioning is one of the critical steps in Hardware/Software Co-Design flow, and has very important influence on the system performance.

So our algorithm is an effective hardware/software partitioning algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512386","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512386.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"494","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/Software partitioning for heterogeneous multicore SOC using particle swarm optimization and immune clone (PSO-IC ) algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/Software partitioning for heterogeneous multicore SOC using particle swarm optimization and immune clone (PSO-IC ) algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11432359","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5512386/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/Software partitioning for heterogeneous multicore SOC using particle swarm optimization and immune clone (PSO-IC ) algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088222S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5512437,"authors":[{"name":"Guancheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Media and Communications Engineering, Weinan Teachers University, Weinan, Shaanxi, China","College of Marine, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Guancheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536512600"},{"name":"Yaan Li","affiliation":["College of Marine, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yaan","lastName":"Li","id":"37538193500"},{"name":"Beili Jin","affiliation":["College of Marine, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Beili","lastName":"Jin","id":"37532744800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512437","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512437","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Degradation","Sensor arrays","Cost function","Interference suppression","Signal to noise ratio","Narrowband","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference (signal)","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array beamforming","support vector regression","practical array systems","adaptive beamforming","interference signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robustness","Adaptive array","Beamforming","Support vector regression","Steering vector uncertainty"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512437","publicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503835/5512010/05512437.pdf","startPage":"2229","endPage":"2233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the robustness of array beamforming based on Support Vector Regression","abstract":"In practical array systems, traditional adaptive beamforming algorithms will degrade if some unexpected assumptions become wrong or imprecise. Therefore, the robustness of adaptive beamforming techniques against environmental and array imperfections is one of the key issues. Compared with traditional methods, robust beamforming brings about much improvement on array performance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to adaptive beamforming that provides increased robustness against the mismatch problems. After generalizing the conventional linearly constrained minimum variance cost function by including a regularization term to penalize differences between the actual and the ideal array responses, we adopt the form of Support Vector Regression (SVR) to increase the beamformer robustness against errors by utilizing \u03b5 -insensitive loss function for the penalty term. In comparison with other robust beamforming techniques especially for high SNR scenarios, simulation results show that the proposed SVR-based beamformer has the desired robust performance both in no-mismatch and mismatch situations regardless of the number of interference signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512437/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11432407","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512437/","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Research on the robustness of array beamforming based on Support Vector Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the robustness of array beamforming based on Support Vector Regression","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA2010421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046458S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503835","isNumber":"5512010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503835","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5512010","articleId":"5512437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5512456,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Meng","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Control and Robotics, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Meng","id":"37533288300"},{"name":"Qingshan She","affiliation":["Institut of Intelligent Control and Robotics, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Qingshan","lastName":"She","id":"37543063400"},{"name":"Yunyuan Gao","affiliation":["Institut of Intelligent Control and Robotics, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yunyuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37537323600"},{"name":"Zhizeng Luo","affiliation":["Institut of Intelligent Control and Robotics, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhizeng","lastName":"Luo","id":"37279737700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5704-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5701-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5702-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5512456","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":693},"abstract":"The application of hidden Markov model (HMM) to recognize gait phase using electromyographic (EMG) signals is described.

On and off-chip sources of power supply noise imbalance in a LNA in a SiP were analyzed. A simultaneous switching noise coupling coefficient for the differential LNA output caused by power supply noise imbalance was simulated through co-modeling a hierarchical on and off-chip PDN. The simulation results were validated by measuring the simultaneous switching noise coupling voltage at the differential LNA output. Further validation of four types of a LNA with different PDN designs demonstrates that simultaneous switching noise coupling to the differential LNA output caused by power supply noise imbalance highly depends on the design of the PDN of the SiP.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Power supplies","Frequency","Differential amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Distributed amplifiers","Power systems","Noise measurement","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential amplifiers","low noise amplifiers","system-in-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply noise imbalance","high frequency differential low noise amplifiers","LNA","system-in-package","off-chip power distribution network","simultaneous switching noise coupling coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-modeling","low noise amplifier (LNA)","power distribution network (PDN)","power supply noise imbalance","simultaneous switching noise (SSN)","system-in-package (SiP)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2010.2047395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/5536890/05512554.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2010.2047395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Power Supply Noise Imbalance on Ultra High Frequency Differential Low Noise Amplifiers in a System-in-Package","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Power Supply Noise Imbalance on Ultra High Frequency Differential Low Noise Amplifiers in a System-in-Package","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512554/","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512554/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11447331","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Power Supply Noise Imbalance on Ultra High Frequency Differential Low Noise Amplifiers in a System-in-Package","sourcePdf":"tadvp-kkoo-2047395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080352S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"5536890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5536890","articleId":"5512554","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5512555,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/5674140/5512555/5512555-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zheng Zhang (S'09) received the B.Eng degree in electronic science and technology, from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2008.

It is well understood that the current practice where servers are connected by a tree hierarchy of network switches cannot meet these requirements. In this paper, we explore a new server-interconnection structure. We observe that the commodity server machines used in today's data centers usually come with two built-in Ethernet ports, one for network connection and the other left for backup purposes. We believe that if both ports are actively used in network connections, we can build a scalable, cost-effective interconnection structure without either the expensive higher-level large switches or any additional hardware on servers. We design such a networking structure called FiConn. Although the server node degree is only 2 in this structure, we have proven that FiConn is highly scalable to encompass hundreds of thousands of servers with low diameter and high bisection width. We have developed a low-overhead traffic-aware routing mechanism to improve effective link utilization based on dynamic traffic state. We have also proposed how to incrementally deploy FiConn.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512560/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512560/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11832665","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scalable and Cost-Effective Interconnection of Data-Center Servers Using Dual Server Ports","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable and Cost-Effective Interconnection of Data-Center Servers Using Dual Server Ports","sourcePdf":"tnet-li-2053718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099384S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5714229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5714229","articleId":"5512560","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5512568,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics (IME), Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5961215/5512568/5512568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Liu received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2007.","From 2006 to 2007, he worked as a Research Engineer with National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Although literature is abundant on 3D-IC floorplanning, none of them consider the areas and positions of signal through-silicon vias (TSVs). In previous research, signal TSVs are viewed as points during the floorplanning stage. Ignoring the areas, positions and connections of signal TSVs, previous research estimates wirelength by measuring the half-perimeter wirelength of pins in a net only. Experimental results reveal that 29.7% of nets possess signal TSVs that cannot be put into the white space within the bounding boxes of pins. Moreover, the total wirelength is underestimated by 26.8% without considering the positions of signal TSVs. The considerable error in wirelength estimation severely degrades the optimality of the floorplan result. Therefore, in this paper, we will propose a two-stage 3-D fixed-outline floorplaning algorithm. Stage one simultaneously plans hard macros and TSV-blocks for wirelength reduction. Stage two improves the wirelength by reassigning signal TSVs. Experimental results show that stage one outperforms a post-processing TSV planning algorithm in successful rate by 57%. Compared to the post-processing TSV planning algorithm, the average wirelength of our result is shorter by 22.3%. In addition, stage two further reduces the wirelength by 3.45% without any area overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2050012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5961215/05512570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2050012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5961215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Through-Silicon Via Planning in 3-D Floorplanning","volume":"19","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5512570/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12175342","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Through-Silicon Via Planning in 3-D Floorplanning","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mtsai-2050012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080459S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5961215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5961215","articleId":"5512570","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5512571,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wu","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5961802/5512571/5512571-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Since DRAM dies should be stacked between the processor die and package substrate, we have to fabricate a large number of through-DRAM through-silicon vias (TSVs) to connect the processor die and package for power and input/output (I/O) signal delivery. Although such through-DRAM TSVs will inevitably interfere with DRAM design and induce non-negligible power consumption overhead, little prior research has been done to study how to allocate these through-DRAM TSVs on the DRAM dies and analyze their impacts. To address this open issue, this paper first presents a through-DRAM TSV allocation strategy that well fits to the regular DRAM architecture. Meanwhile, due to the longer path between power/ground pads and processor die, power delivery integrity issue may become more serious in such 3-D processor-DRAM integrated systems. Decoupling capacitor insertion is the most popular method to deal with power delivery integrity issue in high-performance integrated circuits. This paper further proposes to use 3-D stacked DRAM dies to provide decoupling capacitors for the processor die. This can well leverage the superior capacitor fabrication ability of DRAM to reduce the area penalty of decoupling capacitor insertion on the processor die.

As its most distinctive feature, two pairs of first- and second-order degenerate resonant modes in a ring resonator are simultaneously excited, resulting in a compact dual-mode dual-band bandpass filter with two transmission poles in both passbands. Firstly, two capacitors or parallel-coupled lines are placed at two nonorthogonally excited positions along a ring resonator in order to excite the two first-order degenerate modes and create multiple transmission zeros. Next, a set of perturbations is introduced on the ring to excite the two second-order degenerate modes. In our design, two excitation positions are first placed with between 45\u00b0- and 135\u00b0-separation on a ring. Simulations show that, with a proper arrangement of the excitation angle, two transmission poles in the first passband can be excited and more transmission zeros can be generated. Four and eight open-circuited stubs are loaded symmetrically along the ring, resulting in synchronous excitation of two poles in the second passband. Of the two designed filters with 135\u00b0- and 45\u00b0-separation, the one with 45\u00b0 exhibits much better out-of-band performance with three additional transmission zeros at frequencies lower than the first passband, between the two passbands and higher than the second passband. Finally, two filter prototypes are fabricated and their measured results are found to be in good agreement with theory.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2053590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5662237/05512579.pdf","startPage":"3427","endPage":"3432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2053590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Band Ring-Resonator Bandpass Filter Based on Two Pairs of Degenerate Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512579/","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Band Ring-Resonator Bandpass Filter Based on Two Pairs of Degenerate Modes","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692675","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512579/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Band Ring-Resonator Bandpass Filter Based on Two Pairs of Degenerate Modes","sourcePdf":"tmtt-luo-2053590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078762S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5662237","articleId":"5512579","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512586,"authors":[{"name":"Diogo Caetano Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Diogo Caetano","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37588299200"},{"name":"Ricardo L. de Queiroz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo L.","lastName":"de Queiroz","id":"37295015400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5512586","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Image coding","Predictive models","Image reconstruction","Pixel","Encoding","Video coding","Vectors","Decoding","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","Markov processes","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least-squares directional intra prediction","Markov linear model","least-square estimation","H.264/AVC compression","video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264/AVC intra prediction","image coding","least square prediction"]}],"abstract":"A new intra-prediction mode for the H.264/AVC standard is proposed.

It is now becoming necessary for video distribution systems to be able to generate higher resolution video from lower resolution one for some end users. Current schemes in video up-sampling either only focused on improving visual quality with little or no improvement in objective quality or increasing the up-sampling accuracy by adaptively optimizing interpolation methods. Many such algorithms are typically quite complex and require substantial extra implementation efforts. In this letter, we propose a new hybrid DCT-Wiener-based interpolation scheme for video intra frame up-sampling without referencing the original high resolution video frames. This scheme takes full advantage of interpolation in both DCT domain and spatial domain and seamlessly integrates these two approaches to design an improved up-sampling filter. Experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that noticeable improvement in both objective and visual quality are obtained. With similar complexity, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 4 dB gain in PSNR over fixed parameter Wiener filter-based interpolation, 4 dB gain over popular bicubic interpolation, and 1 dB gain over up-sampling scheme in DCT domain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Wiener filter","Spatial resolution","Video compression","Gain","Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Static VAr compensators","Scalability","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image sampling","interpolation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT-Wiener-based interpolation scheme","video intraframe up-sampling","video frame resizing","video distribution","visual quality","high resolution video frames"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DCT","interpolation","up-sampling","Wiener filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2059700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5545517/05512590.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2059700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Hybrid DCT-Wiener-Based Interpolation Scheme for Video Intra Frame Up-Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Hybrid DCT-Wiener-Based Interpolation Scheme for Video Intra Frame Up-Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512590/","volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512590/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11463975","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Hybrid DCT-Wiener-Based Interpolation Scheme for Video Intra Frame Up-Sampling","sourcePdf":"lsp-wu-2059700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059957S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5545517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5545517","articleId":"5512590","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512591,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Due to the symmetrical ambipolar conduction in graphene, graphene-based mixers can effectively suppress odd-order intermodulations and lead to lower spurious emissions in the circuit. The mixer operation was demonstrated at a frequency of 10 MHz using graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition on a Ni film and then transferred to an insulating substrate.

The results obtained show that: 1) The surface impedance approximation can generate correct horizontal electric field when the distance to the point of observation is larger than about 50, 200, and 500 m for ground conductivities of 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 S/m, respectively. 2) It is necessary to include propagation effects in the magnetic field that is being used as an input in the surface impedance expression when it is being used to calculate the horizontal electric field. 3) Cooray-Rubinstein approximation gives exact results when it is being used to calculate the horizontal electric field aboveground generated by cloud flashes. 4) Cooray's simplified formula connecting the surface horizontal electric field to the underground one gives accurate results, provided that the horizontal electric field at the surface of the ground, which is used as an input, is calculated accurately and the depth of the point of observation is kept much less than the distance to the point of strike.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Horizontal Electric Field Above- and Underground Produced by Lightning Flashes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2010.2051230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5580183/05512610.pdf","startPage":"936","endPage":"943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2010.2051230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Horizontal Electric Field Above- and Underground Produced by Lightning Flashes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5512610/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641692","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Horizontal Electric Field Above- and Underground Produced by Lightning Flashes","sourcePdf":"temc-cooray-2051230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068667S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5580183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5580183","articleId":"5512610","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5512625,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Lei","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5669205/5512625/5512625-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Lei received the B.S. degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2010.","He is currently with the Center for Biometrics and Security Research and National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

The position, spatial frequency and orientation selectivity properties are believed to have an important role in visual perception. This paper proposes a novel face representation and recognition approach by exploring information jointly in image space, scale and orientation domains. Specifically, the face image is first decomposed into different scale and orientation responses by convolving multiscale and multi-orientation Gabor filters. Second, local binary pattern analysis is used to describe the neighboring relationship not only in image space, but also in different scale and orientation responses. This way, information from different domains is explored to give a good face representation for recognition. Discriminant classification is then performed based upon weighted histogram intersection or conditional mutual information with linear discriminant analysis techniques. Extensive experimental results on FERET, AR, and FRGC ver 2.0 databases show the significant advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2060207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5669205/05512625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2060207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669205","startPage":"247","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition by Exploring Information Jointly in Space, Scale and Orientation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition by Exploring Information Jointly in Space, Scale and Orientation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704242","pubMedId":"20643604","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5512625/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition by Exploring Information Jointly in Space, Scale and Orientation","sourcePdf":"tip-lei-2060207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10047S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5669205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5669205","articleId":"5512625","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512630,"authors":[{"name":"Gregorio L\u00f3pez","affiliation":["Telematic Engineering Department, Carlos III Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Telematic Engineering Department, Carlos III University, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5610573/5512630/5512630-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gregorio L\u00f3pez received the Telecommunication Engineering degree in 2008 from Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M), Madrid, Spain, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in telematic engineering.","He has been with the UC3M Network Technology Group led by Dr. J.

One way to mitigate the ITI is to equalize the read channel to a two dimensional (2D) partial-response (PR) target. However, we find that the channel detection on the center track cannot take advantage of the 2D target without good estimation of the data on the sidetracks. Therefore, we propose a multi-track detection technique, where the detection on the center track is aided by the information obtained from the detection of the sidetracks. This technique works with any equalizer capable of equalizing the channel to a 2D target. We apply this method to joint-track equalized and 2D equalized BPMR channels. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique provides a significant performance improvement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-Track Interference Mitigation for Bit-Patterned Magnetic Recording","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2056926","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5605384/05512631.pdf","startPage":"3899","endPage":"3908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2056926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Inter-Track Interference Mitigation for Bit-Patterned Magnetic Recording","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5512631/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588657","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-Track Interference Mitigation for Bit-Patterned Magnetic Recording","sourcePdf":"tmag-cruz-2056926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087066S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5605384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5605384","articleId":"5512631","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512632,"authors":[{"name":"Junghoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Junghoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538756500"},{"name":"Christian Labat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Labat","id":"37548002000"},{"name":"Ameet K.

Intraoperative localization of the implanted seeds provides potential for dose evaluation and optimization during therapy. A reduced-dimensionality matching algorithm for prostate brachytherapy seed reconstruction (REDMAPS) that uses multiple X-ray fluoroscopy images obtained from different poses is proposed. The seed reconstruction problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, and REDMAPS finds a solution in a clinically acceptable amount of time using dimensionality reduction to create a smaller space of possible solutions. Dimensionality reduction is possible since the optimal solution has approximately zero cost when the poses of the acquired images are known to be within a small error. REDMAPS is also formulated to address the \u201chidden seed problem\u201d in which seeds overlap on one or more observed images. REDMAPS uses a pruning algorithm to avoid unnecessary computation of cost metrics and the reduced problem is solved using linear programming. REDMAPS was first evaluated and its parameters tuned using simulations. It was then validated using five phantom and 21 patient datasets. REDMAPS was successful in reconstructing the seeds with an overall seed matching rate above 99% and a reconstruction error below 1 mm in less than 5 s.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2059709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5676464/05512632.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2059709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REDMAPS: Reduced-Dimensionality Matching for Prostate Brachytherapy Seed Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512632/","displayDocTitle":"REDMAPS: Reduced-Dimensionality Matching for Prostate Brachytherapy Seed Reconstruction","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11727993","pubMedId":"20643600","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512632/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REDMAPS: Reduced-Dimensionality Matching for Prostate Brachytherapy Seed Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tmi-lee-2059709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160546S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5676464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5676464","articleId":"5512632","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512633,"authors":[{"name":"Nghia Q.

This study explores a new approximation to the ideal Bayesian observer strategy that allows for object heterogeneity. The new method, called iterative Wiener filtering, is implemented using echo data simulations and a phantom study. We studied five lesion features closely associated with visual discrimination for clinical diagnosis. A series of human observer measurements for the same image data allowed us to quantitatively compare alternative beamforming strategies through measurements of visual discrimination efficiency. Employing the Smith-Wagner model observer, we were able to breakdown efficiency estimates and identify the processing stage at which performance losses occur. The methods were implemented using a commercial scanner and a cyst phantom to explore development of spatial filters for systems with shift-variant impulse response functions. Overall we found that significant improvements were realized over standard B-mode images using a delay-and-sum beamformer but at the cost of higher complexity and computational load.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2059035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5676464/05512633.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2059035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"28","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Filter to Approximate the Bayesian Strategy for Sonographic Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Filter to Approximate the Bayesian Strategy for Sonographic Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512633/","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5512633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11727997","pubMedId":"20643601","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Filter to Approximate the Bayesian Strategy for Sonographic Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tmi-nguyen-2059035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126475S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5676464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5676464","articleId":"5512633","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5512637,"authors":[{"name":"Yugang Niu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yugang","lastName":"Niu","id":"37268475200"},{"name":"Daniel W.

Among all, low-voltage ride-through has been enforced in the field, which is one of the major challenges for WECS. It is necessary to design an integrated controller to protect the converter from overvoltage/overcurrent and to support the grid voltage during faults and recoveries. In this paper, a unified dc-link current control scheme for current-source-converter-based WECS is proposed. The controllers for generator- and grid-side converters are coordinated to provide fault ride-through capability.

Recommendations of mechanical and electrical criteria have to be graduated according to duty categories (as environment parameters for the road tunnels).

The system performs online identification of the capacitor's equivalent series resistance (ESR) in order to detect the life-cycle status and permit preventive maintenance. The ESR detection is based on the capacitor's ac losses calculated from voltage/current measurements using a simple low-cost microcontroller. The unit is designed as small printed circuit board located directly at the capacitor's screw terminals in order to simplify the required temperature sensing and to minimize wiring effort. The minimized energy consumption allows a power supply taken out of the capacitor to be tested. Besides life-cycle monitoring, the unit further facilitates energy-efficient voltage balancing for capacitors in series arrangements avoiding any power resistors typically used in balancing circuits. Instead, the unit controls the capacitor voltage by influencing its power consumption. Each individual monitoring unit (one per each power capacitor of the converter) transfers the ESR results to the converter's main controller and receives control commands via a common optoisolated fieldbus. Alternatively, this data transfer is performed using wireless near-field communication leading to a completely autonomous monitoring unit without any wiring for power supply and data transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Life-Cycle Monitoring and Voltage-Managing Unit for DC-Link Electrolytic Capacitors in PWM Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2059713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5710539/05512646.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2059713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Life-Cycle Monitoring and Voltage-Managing Unit for DC-Link Electrolytic Capacitors in PWM Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5512646/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11793971","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Life-Cycle Monitoring and Voltage-Managing Unit for DC-Link Electrolytic Capacitors in PWM Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-ertl-2059713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098422S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5710539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5710539","articleId":"5512646","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5512647,"authors":[{"name":"Laxman Maharjan","affiliation":["Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6144184/5512647/5512647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Laxman Maharjan (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) was born in Lalitpur, Nepal, on January 2, 1979.

The existing literature have proposed some methods to reduce torque and flux ripple by optimizing the duty ratio of the active vector. However, these methods are usually complicated and parameter dependent. This paper first compares the performances of three duty determination methods in detail and then proposes a very simple but effective method to obtain the duty ratio. The novel method is superior to the existing methods in terms of simplicity and robustness. By appropriately arranging the sequence of the vectors, the commutation frequency is reduced effectively without performance degradation. To further improve the performance of system, a low-pass filter-based voltage model with compensations of amplitude and phase is employed to acquire accurate stator flux estimation. The proposed scheme is able to reduce the torque and flux ripple significantly while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of conventional DTC at the most. Simulations and presented experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Torque Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Reduced Torque Ripple and Commutation Frequency","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2059047","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5677632/05512651.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2059047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5677632","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Direct Torque Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Reduced Torque Ripple and Commutation Frequency","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5512651/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11728036","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Torque Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Reduced Torque Ripple and Commutation Frequency","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2059047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083855S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5677632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"258","xplore-issue":"5677632","articleId":"5512651","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512656,"authors":[{"name":"Vasilis Christos Papamichael","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic School, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasilis Christos","lastName":"Papamichael","id":"37064539300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5512656","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Diversity reception","Bit error rate","Diversity methods","Antenna measurements","Stochastic processes","Signal to noise ratio","Mutual coupling","Cellular phones","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","diversity reception","error statistics","performance evaluation","planar inverted-F antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrix method","selection-combining diversity performance evaluation","multielement antenna systems","effective diversity gain","signal-to-noise ratio reduction","average bit error rate","printed inverted-F antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna diversity","bit error rate (BER)","covariance matrix","effective diversity gain (EDG)","mutual coupling","outage probability","selection combining (SC)"]}],"abstract":"Until now, the application of the covariance matrix method for evaluating the selection-combining (SC) diversity performance is restricted to the case of actual antenna systems comprising two elements.

Partial equalization (PE) is a low-complexity technique for combining the signals of subcarriers to improve the achievable performance of MC-CDMA systems in terms of their bit error probability (BEP) and bit error outage (BEO) in comparison with maximal ratio combining, orthogonality restoring combining, and equal-gain combining techniques. We analyze the performance of the multiuser MC-CDMA downlink and derive the optimal PE parameter expression, which minimizes the BEP. Realistic imperfect channel estimation and frequency-domain (FD) block-fading channels are considered. More explicitly, the analytical expression of the optimum PE parameter is derived as a function of the number of subcarriers, number of active users (i.e., the system load), mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and variance of the channel-estimation errors for the aforementioned FD block-fading channel. We show that the choice of the optimal PE technique significantly increases the achievable system load for the given target BEP and BEO.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5601981/05512675.pdf","startPage":"3818","endPage":"3830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2060217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2060217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Equalization for MC\u2013CDMA Systems in Non-Ideally Estimated Correlated Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Fading","Diversity reception","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","Error probability","Signal restoration","Performance gain","Performance analysis","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MC-CDMA system partial equalization","nonideally estimated correlated fading channel","multicarrier code division multiple access","high data rates","next generation multiuser wireless communication system","low complexity technique","bit error probability","bit error outage","maximal ratio combining","orthogonality restoring combining techniques","equal gain combining techniques","optimal PE parameter expression","frequency domain block fading channel estimation","mean signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","fading channel","multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC\u2013CDMA)","partial equalization (PE)","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Partial Equalization for MC\u2013CDMA Systems in Non-Ideally Estimated Correlated Fading","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5512675/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588260","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Equalization for MC\u2013CDMA Systems in Non-Ideally Estimated Correlated Fading","sourcePdf":"tvt-zabini-2060217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09876S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5601981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5601981","articleId":"5512675","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512676,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5601981/5512676/5512676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Zhou received the B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2008.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel cooperative cross-layer medium access control (CC-MAC) protocol, which combines space-time coding and adaptive modulation at the physical layer and employs truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) at the data-link layer. The transmitter's partner is selected in the previous hop, and the receiver invites a partner to participate in data reception in the current hop, and in this situation, a two-transmitter two-receiver model is constructed. Because distributed space-time coding is applied at the transmitting set (transmitter and its partner), cooperative diversity and coding gain can be obtained. Based on the instantaneous channel state measured at the receiver, an adaptive modulation scheme is adopted to improve the link throughput at the physical layer. In addition, the truncated ARQ scheme is employed to further enhance the throughput performance at the data-link layer. Furthermore, under different system models with or without the truncated ARQ scheme, performances of the average packet error rate (PER) and symbol error rate (SER) with multiple phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation and multiple quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) over Rayleigh fading channel are analyzed. Simulation results verify the correctness of the performance analysis and show that CC-MAC can significantly improve system throughput and energy efficiency compared with other transmission schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2060216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5601981/05512676.pdf","startPage":"4116","endPage":"4127","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2060216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Transmitter Two-Receiver Cooperative MAC Protocol: Cross-Layer Design and Performance Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Two-Transmitter Two-Receiver Cooperative MAC Protocol: Cross-Layer Design and Performance Analysis","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5512676/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588261","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Transmitter Two-Receiver Cooperative MAC Protocol: Cross-Layer Design and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhou-2060216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069379S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5601981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5601981","articleId":"5512676","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5512681,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Di","affiliation":["Laboratory of Applications of Remote Sensing, School of Civil Engineering, Computational Science and Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Di","id":"37299867600"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Biometric Research Center, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177000"},{"name":"David Zhang","affiliation":["Biometric Research Center, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279211300"},{"name":"Quan Pan","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37278540400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4427"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2426"}],"articleNumber":"5512681","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1505},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Skin","Principal component analysis","Electromagnetic wave absorption","Testing","Remote sensing","Biometrics","Face detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image colour analysis","principal component analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral face recognition","visible spectrum","feature band selection","visible light bands","face skin physical absorption characteristics","decision level fusion strategy","hyperspectral face database","RGB color bands"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band selection","face recognition","hyperspectral imaging","principal component analysis (PCA)"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence paper studies face recognition by using hyperspectral imagery in the visible light bands. The spectral measurements over the visible spectrum have different discriminatory information for the task of face identification, and it is found that the absorption bands related to hemoglobin are more discriminative than the other bands. Therefore, feature band selection based on the physical absorption characteristics of face skin is performed, and two feature band subsets are selected.

The experimental results demonstrated that hyperspectral face recognition with the selected feature bands outperforms that by using a single band, using the whole bands, or, interestingly, using the conventional RGB color bands.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2052603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5602001/05512681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2052603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602001","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studies on Hyperspectral Face Recognition in Visible Spectrum With Feature Band Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Studies on Hyperspectral Face Recognition in Visible Spectrum With Feature Band Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588413","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5512681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies on Hyperspectral Face Recognition in Visible Spectrum With Feature Band Selection","sourcePdf":"tsmca-zhang-2052603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085898S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5602001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5602001","articleId":"5512681","onlineDate":"19 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512688,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5512686/5512688/5512688-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Pang (M'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sichuan University, Sichuan, China, in 2000, and the M.S. degree (honors) in communication and information engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan, in 2003.

Nevertheless, the yield loss of memory products caused by deep submicrometer defects and manufacturing uncertainties is still a critical issue. In order to solve the yield issue, built-in self-repair (BISR) has been considered as the most cost-effective solution. However, implementing BISR on flash memories is not trivial. In this paper, we propose BISR schemes for nor flash memory and NAND flash memory, respectively. The BISR schemes perform built-in self-test, built-in redundancy analysis, and on-chip repair. For the BISR scheme of nor flash memory, a typical redundancy architecture is assumed, based on which we analyze three existing algorithms and propose a redundancy analysis (RA) algorithm. On the other hand, for NAND flash memory, an RA algorithm based on an efficient 2-D redundancy architecture is proposed, and considering the widely used page-mode operation in NAND flash memory, a method to discover currently accessed address is also proposed.

The paper builds on an increasing body of work concerned with modeling reconfigurable architectures, and presents a full area and delay model of an FPGA. We use a geometric programming framework to show how transistor sizing and high-level architecture parameter selection can now be solved as a concurrent optimization problem. We validate the model through the use of simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) models and the versatile place and route (VPR) FPGA architecture simulation tool. Not only does the optimization framework allow architectures to be optimized orders of magnitude faster than previous work, but the combined optimization can lead to different architectural conclusions compared to conventional methods by exploring the coupling between the two sets of optimization variables. Specifically, we show that as delay takes more significance in the objective of the optimization, there should be more lookup tables in a logic block, whereas conventional techniques suggest that there should be fewer lookup tables in an FPGA logic block.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2049046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5512686/05512702.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2049046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Architecture Optimization Using Geometric Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Architecture Optimization Using Geometric Programming","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512702/","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11430217","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Architecture Optimization Using Geometric Programming","sourcePdf":"tcad-asmith-2049046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113514S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5512686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5512686","articleId":"5512702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512705,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Viikari","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5508574/5512705/5512705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ville V.

Furthermore several attacks that used a fault to derive secret information have been demonstrated on cryptosystems. Concurrent fault detection is thus of prime interest for such systems. The purpose of this paper is to compare several code-based concurrent fault detection schemes dedicated to the hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard. The protection schemes under comparison are either directly issued from the literature, or built from several complementary solutions for protection of the full implementation. The evaluation of these schemes is performed in terms of costs with particular emphasis on fault injection vs errors detection capabilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test

The framework integrates three strategies independently designed to tackle the problem of SEUs; first a systematic methodology is used to harden the circuit exploiting an enhanced TMR-based technique, coupled with partial dynamic reconfiguration. Then, a robustness analysis is performed to identify possible TMR failures, eventually solved by a specific local re-design of the critical portions of the implementation. We present the overall flow and the benefits of the solution, experimentally evaluated on a realistic circuit.","doi":"10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512757","publicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508193/5512725/05512757.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated flow for the design of hardened circuits on SRAM-based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512757/","displayDocTitle":"An integrated flow for the design of hardened circuits on SRAM-based FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512757/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11432635","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated flow for the design of hardened circuits on SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"214ets10140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102605S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508193","isNumber":"5512725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508193","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5512725","articleId":"5512757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5512768,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Experimental results show that estimation of delay degradation significantly affects path selection, and accurate estimation is important for the test.","doi":"10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512772","publicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508193/5512725/05512772.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On estimation of NBTI-Induced delay degradation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512772/","displayDocTitle":"On estimation of NBTI-Induced delay degradation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11432649","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512772/","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On estimation of NBTI-Induced delay degradation","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"107ets10071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090334S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508193","isNumber":"5512725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508193","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5512725","articleId":"5512772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5512778,"authors":[{"name":"Elena I.

In this paper we present a method of dynamic noise margin (DNM) estimation based on the modeling technique developed that can efficiently estimate failures in bit-cells under parameter variations. The proposed DNM estimation method is fast, and can accurately estimate the SRAM yield.

Stacking entire wafers has attractive benefits, but unfortunately suffers from low compound stack yield, as one cannot prevent to stack a bad die to a good die or vice versa. Matching individual wafers from repositories of pre-tested wafers to each other is a simple yet effective method to significantly increase the compound stack yield. In this paper, we present a mathematical model, which shows that the yield increase depends on (1) the number of stack tiers, (2) the number of dies per wafer, (3) the die yield, and (4) the repository size. Simulation results demonstrate that, for realistic cases, relative yield increases of 0.5% to 10% can be achieved. We also show that the required investment, in terms of a limited increase in either test or package costs, is typically well justified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the cost-effectiveness of matching repositories of pre-tested wafers for wafer-to-wafer 3D chip stacking","publicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512785","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 15th IEEE European Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508193/5512725/05512785.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the cost-effectiveness of matching repositories of pre-tested wafers for wafer-to-wafer 3D chip stacking","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512785/","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11432661","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the cost-effectiveness of matching repositories of pre-tested wafers for wafer-to-wafer 3D chip stacking","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"036ets10022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051231S","chronDate":"24-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508193","isNumber":"5512725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508193","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5512725","articleId":"5512785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5512800,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Abdennadher","affiliation":["Emerging Technologies Department of IT Business, Schneider Electric, INOVALLEE, Saint Ismier, France","Emerging Technologies Department of IT Business, INOVALLEE, Saint Ismier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5512798/5512800/5512800-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karim Abdennadher (S'08) was born in Aix-en-Provence, France, on April 19, 1982.

Commonly used thermal networks tend not to account for an internal heat generation that is essential for accurate temperature predictions. In contrast, the general element proposed in this paper includes the internal heat generation as well as a material thermal anisotropy. To validate the technique, thermal models of an inductor using the equivalent circuit method based around a general cuboidal element and a full 3D finite element analysis was constructed and analyzed. The calculated results from the cuboidal element method show good agreement with the FEM predictions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The goal of the optimization is to reduce the size of inductors satisfying the specifications on inductance values under weak and strong bias-current conditions. The inductance values are computed from the finite-element (FE) method taking magnetic saturation into account. The result of the parameter optimization, which leads to significant reduction in the volume, is realized for test, and the dependence of inductance on bias currents is experimentally measured, which is shown to agree well with the computed values. Moreover, novel methods are introduced for topology optimization to obtain inductor shapes with homogeneous ferrite cores suitable for mass production.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2044986","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5512832/05512839.pdf","startPage":"3393","endPage":"3396","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2044986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Inductors Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Its Experimental Validation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Inductors Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Its Experimental Validation","volume":"46","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11430230","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5512839/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Inductors Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Its Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"tmag-watanabe-2044986-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038422S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5512832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5512832","articleId":"5512839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5512851,"authors":[{"name":"Norio Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Norio","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277509800"},{"name":"Takaya Yamada","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaya","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37537687900"},{"name":"Daisuke Miyagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Miyagi","id":"37269654300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5512851","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Rotors","Stator cores","Magnetic analysis","Topology","Finite element methods","Design optimization","Optimization methods","Forging","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","magnetic devices","permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IPM motor optimal design","topology optimization","magnetic material","magnetic devices","ON-OFF sensitivity method","interior permanent magnet","B-H curve","stator current phase angle","finite element method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjoint variable method","finite-element analysis","IPM motor","topology optimization"]}],"abstract":"The topology optimization by distributing the magnetic material in the design domain, which is called as the ON/OFF method, is attractive for designers of magnetic devices, because an initial conceptual design, that we could not imagined beforehand, may be obtained.

This paper presents an electrokinetic model refinement via a perturbation finite-element method to calculate the grounding resistance of counterpoise wires. The perturbation method is herein developed for refining the electric field distribution in soil starting from simplified models, based on electric field distributions from 2-D models, that evolve towards a 3-D accurate model. The analysis of the distribution of the electric field and of the electric potential around the tower footing allows accurately determining the tower footing resistance. The comparisons between the grounding resistance simulated and calculated analytically of a counterpoise wire are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2045115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5512832/05512985.pdf","startPage":"2839","endPage":"2842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2045115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrokinetic Model Refinement Via a Perturbation Finite-Element Method\u2014From 2-D to 3-D","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5512985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5512985/","displayDocTitle":"Electrokinetic Model Refinement Via a Perturbation Finite-Element Method\u2014From 2-D to 3-D","volume":"46","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11484077","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5512985/","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrokinetic Model Refinement Via a Perturbation Finite-Element Method\u2014From 2-D to 3-D","sourcePdf":"tmag-mferreiradaluz-2045115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079999S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5512832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","xplore-issue":"5512832","articleId":"5512985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5512987,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

Even though the analytical software remains the most used tool, the FEA is widely used to refine the analysis and gives the final design to be prototyped. The power factor, a standard data of motor manufactures data sheet is important because it shows how much reactive power is consumed by the motor. This data becomes important when the motor is connected to network. However, the calculation of power factor is not an easy task. Due to the saturation phenomena the input motor current has a high level of harmonics that cannot be neglected. In this work the FEA is used to evaluate a proposed (not limitative) methodology to estimate the power factor or displacement factor of a small single-phase induction motor.

Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared with the widely used Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) method highlighting a strongly different behaviour of these strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2010.2047250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5512832/05513035.pdf","startPage":"3289","endPage":"3292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2010.2047250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiobjective Gaussian Particle Swarm Approach Applied to Electromagnetic Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Multiobjective Gaussian Particle Swarm Approach Applied to Electromagnetic Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513035/","accessionNumber":"11484159","volume":"46","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiobjective Gaussian Particle Swarm Approach Applied to Electromagnetic Optimization","sourcePdf":"tmag-alotto-2047250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066085S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5512832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5512832","articleId":"5513035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513036,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Aiello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi (DIEES), Universit\u00e1 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Aiello","id":"37299972100"},{"name":"Salvatore Alfonzetti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi (DIEES), Universit\u00e1 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Alfonzetti","id":"37297268500"},{"name":"Nunzio Salerno","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi (DIEES), Universit\u00e1 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Nunzio","lastName":"Salerno","id":"37297266200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5513036","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper an improved placement of the integration surface for the integral equation in the hybrid finite element method-Dirichlet boundary condition iteration (FEM-DBCI) method is achieved by selecting it as lying in the middle of the tetrahedral or hexahedral finite elements.

Stability or reliability of a PUF response is a key concern, especially when the IC containing the PUF is subjected to severe environmental variations. In cryptographic applications, errors in response bits need to be completely corrected and this is often done using costly error correction codes (ECC). In identification and authentication applications however, a complete correction of response bits is not necessary and hence costly ECC schemes can be avoided. On the flip side, a response with faulty bits cannot be post-conditioned by one-way functions, resulting in an increased vulnerability to modeling attacks. We propose a sense amplifier based PUF (SA-PUF) structure that generates random bits with increased reliability, resulting in significantly fewer errors in response bits. This eliminates the need of complex and costly ECC circuitry in cryptographic applications. Further, with the reduced cost of ECC implementation, the use of one-way functions to post-condition the outputs becomes more viable even in identification and authentication applications, thereby increasing their resilience to modeling based attacks. Finally, SA-PUF elements are inherently more resilient to environmental changes as compared to most of the earlier proposed silicon based PUF structures. Simulation data in 65nm bulk CMOS industrial process show that SA-based PUFs have 2.5x-3.5x lower errors compared to other PUF implementations when subjected to similar environmental variations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attack resistant sense amplifier based PUFs (SA-PUF) with deterministic and controllable reliability of PUF responses","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","doi":"10.1109/HST.2010.5513106","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507538/5513098/05513106.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2010.5513106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513106/","xploreNote":"When the article was originally published the author names were omitted in error.

Repeated unilateral authentication is used in scenarios where a prover repeatedly authenticates himself to the same verifier. Our protocol requires the transfer of only one single message for this purpose and reduces the required computations on the prover's side to a minimum which supports efficient implementations. In order to support this, a three pass setup protocol has to performed once.

We analyze the experimental data using a ring oscillator loop delay model, and quantify the quality factors of a PUF such as uniqueness and reliability. The RO-PUF shows an average inter-die Hamming distance of 47.31%, and an average intra-die Hamming distance of 0.86% at normal operating condition.

Moreover, in the emerging nanometer regime of VLSI, accidental faults will occur at very high rates. While straightforward hardware redundancy based concurrent error detection (CED) can detect transient and permanent faults, it entails 100% area overhead. On the other hand, time redundancy based CED can only detect transient faults with minimum area overhead but entails 100% time overhead. In this paper we present a general time redundancy based CED technique called SLICED for pipelined implementations of symmetric block cipher. SLICED SLIdes one encryption over another and compares their results for CED as a basis for protection against accidental faults and deliberate fault attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","xploreNote":"When the article was originally published the author names were omitted in error.

Using a SASEBO-GII FPGA board as a starting point, we evaluate the performance of the 14 remaining SHA-3 candidates with respect to area, throughput, and power consumption.

In our approach, we first remove those easy-to-detect signals whose activation and propagation are easy using functional vectors. The remaining signals are subjected to a N-detect full-scan ATPG tool to identify those which are functionally hard-to-excite and/or propagate. But unlike recognizing hard-to-detect signal(s), behavioral change brought about by these insertion(s) needs to be taken into account to narrow down their implantation locations. So in our third step, detection condition of suspect signals are cross checked against the spec by a suspect-signal-guided equivalence checking set-up. Finally, a region isolation approach is applied on the filtered signals to determine clusters of untestable gates in the circuit. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmarks show that we are able to return a very small set of candidate locations where the stealthy malicious insertion could reside.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513114/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513114/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11417649","conferenceDate":"13-14 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trusted RTL: Trojan detection methodology in pre-silicon designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trusted RTL: Trojan detection methodology in pre-silicon designs","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp12P021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049573S","chronDate":"13-14 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507538","isNumber":"5513098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507538","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5513098","articleId":"5513114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513116,"authors":[{"name":"Xinxin Fan","affiliation":["E&CE Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Fan","id":"37401468000"},{"name":"Guang Gong","affiliation":["E&CE Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37272938000"},{"name":"Ken Lauffenburger","affiliation":["Aava Technology Limited Liability Company, Garland, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Lauffenburger","id":"37546378000"},{"name":"Troy Hicks","affiliation":["Revere Security Corporation, Addison, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Troy","lastName":"Hicks","id":"37544587500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7812-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7811-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7810-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5513116","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1007},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Hardware","RFID tags","Smart cards","Wireless sensor networks","Intelligent sensors","Communication system security","Embedded software","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementations","hummingbird cryptographic algorithm","resource-constrained devices","RFID tags","smart cards","wireless sensor nodes","field-programmable gate array devices","encryption core","decryption core","Xilinx FPGA series Spartan-3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lightweight cryptographic primitive","resource-constrained devices","FPGA implementations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513116","abstract":"Hummingbird is a new ultra-lightweight cryptographic algorithm targeted for resource-constrained devices like RFID tags, smart cards, and wireless sensor nodes.

Illegal copies of IP cores can cause multi-million dollar damages and are thus considered a serious threat. One possible solution to this problem can be digital watermarking schemes for integrated circuits. We propose a new watermarking technique that employs side-channels as building blocks and can easily and reliably be detected by methods adapted from side-channel analysis. The main idea is to embed a unique signal into a side-channel of the device that serves as a watermark. This enables circuit designers to check integrated circuits for unauthorized use of their watermarked cores. The watermark is hidden below the noise floor of the side channel and is thus hidden from third parties. Furthermore, the proposed schemes can be implemented with very few gates and are thus even harder to detect and to remove. The proposed watermarks can also be realized in a programmable fashion to leak a digital signature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513098","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507538/5513098/05513117.pdf","doi":"10.1109/HST.2010.5513117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2010.5513117","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Side-channel based watermarks for integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513117/","displayDocTitle":"Side-channel based watermarks for integrated circuits","htmlLink":"/document/5513117/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 June 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11417652","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Side-channel based watermarks for integrated circuits","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp07P010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052017S","chronDate":"13-14 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5507538","isNumber":"5513098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5507538","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5513098","articleId":"5513117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513119,"authors":[{"name":"CJ Clark","affiliation":["Intellitech"],"firstName":"CJ","lastName":"Clark","id":"37335784600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7812-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7811-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7810-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5513119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":48,"totalDownloads":863},"abstract":"This paper describes an anti-tamper JTAG Tap design which uses SHA256 secure hash and a true random number generator (TRNG) to create a low gate overhead challenge/response based access system for IC test and on-chip internals.

As a new approach an additional actuator was added to generate forces in physical contact while the UAV stays horizontal. A control architecture based on ultrasonic distance sensors and a CMOS-camera is proposed. The performance of the system was proved by several flight tests.

is designed to fulfill the task of formation control of multiple mobile robots. The neural network contains three layers with different neuron model for different layer: the input layer encodes the inputs including sensor and task-related information by leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, the hidden layer uses the approximate coincidence detection coding to fuse the information from the input layer and the spike response model (SRM model) is applied to the output layer to fire spikes to drive the motors. By the leader-follower strategy and the SNN controller, the multiple mobile robots system can realize the formation control. The validity of this controller is testified by the simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMECH.2010.5513153","doi":"10.1109/RAMECH.2010.5513153","startPage":"447","endPage":"452","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508191/5513125/05513153.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513153/","displayDocTitle":"Formation control for multiple mobile robots based on the Spiking Neural Network","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11432528","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513153/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formation control for multiple mobile robots based on the Spiking Neural Network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp73RAM130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080231S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508191","isNumber":"5513125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508191","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513125","articleId":"5513153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5513180,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos A.

In this paper we propose a robust, real-time obstacle avoidance extension of the classic potential field methodology. Our algorithm is specially adapted to share the wheelchair's control with the user avoiding risky situations. This method relies on the idea of virtual forces, generated by the user command (attractive force) and by the objects detected on each ultrasonic sensor (repulsive forces), acting on the wheelchair. The resultant wheelchair's behavior is obtained by the sum of the attractive force and all the repulsive forces at a given position. Experimental results from drive tests in a cluttered office environment provided statistical evidence that the proposed algorithm is effective to reduce the number of collisions and still improve the user's safety perception.","doi":"10.1109/RAMECH.2010.5513193","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics","startPage":"182","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMECH.2010.5513193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513125","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508191/5513125/05513193.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wheelchairs","Intelligent robots","Safety","Artificial intelligence","Mobile robots","Navigation","Control systems","Real time systems","Force sensors","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","handicapped aids","medical robotics","mobile robots","safety","wheelchairs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obstacle avoidance","shared control","intelligent wheelchairs","potential field methodology","ultrasonic sensor","attractive force","repulsive forces","user safety perception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent wheelchairs","obstacle avoidance","potential field"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Shared control for obstacle avoidance in intelligent wheelchairs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513193/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513193/","accessionNumber":"11432567","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared control for obstacle avoidance in intelligent wheelchairs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp33RAM030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05778S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508191","isNumber":"5513125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508191","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5513125","articleId":"5513193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5513231,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Sabato","affiliation":["PARALLEL Informatik AG, Luzern, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Sabato","id":"37546113500"},{"name":"Mehdi Molkaraie","affiliation":["Department Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Molkaraie","id":"37283356500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513231","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belief propagation","Interference constraints","Information rates","Clustering algorithms","Computational modeling","Convergence","Optical recording","Timing","Holography","Memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","convergence of numerical methods","runlength codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized belief propagation algorithm","multidimensional runlength limited constraints","noiseless capacity","Shannon channel capacity","convergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513231","abstract":"The performance of the generalized belief propagation algorithm for computing the noiseless capacity of finite-sized two-dimensional and three-dimensional run-length limited constraints is investigated.

On the other hand, if there exists a universal code using LDPC matrices, we can arbitrary decrease the error probability for all sources whose achievable rate region contains the rate pair of encoders even if the probability distribution of sources is unknown. To this end, we show the existence of a universal Slepian-Wolf source code using LDPC matrices in the case where the source is stationary memoryless.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

In this paper, we address bandwidth-optimal (n, k, d) Exact-Repair MDS codes, which allow for any failed node to be repaired exactly with access to arbitrary d survivor nodes, where k \u2264 d \u2264 n - 1. Under scalarlinear codes which do not permit symbol-splitting, we construct Exact-Repair MDS codes that are optimal in repair bandwidth for the case of k/n \u2264 1/2 and d \u2265 2k - 1. Our codes are deterministic and require a finite-field size of at most 2(n - k). Under vector-linear codes which allow for the break-up of stored symbols into arbitrarily small subsymbols, we show the existence of optimal Exact-Repair codes for the entire admissible range of possible (n, k, d), i.e., k \u2264 n and k \u2264 d \u2264 n - 1. That is, we establish the existence of vector-linear Exact-Repair MDS codes that match the fundamental cutset lower bound. Our approach for both the constructive scalar-linear code design and for the existence of vector-linear codes is based on interference alignment techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513263","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513263.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact-repair MDS codes for distributed storage using interference alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513263/","displayDocTitle":"Exact-repair MDS codes for distributed storage using interference alignment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434364","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513263/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact-repair MDS codes for distributed storage using interference alignment","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064975S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513267,"authors":[{"name":"Chengzhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Chengzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37403928600"},{"name":"Huaiyu Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Huaiyu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37335980600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513267","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","Capacity planning","Performance analysis","Ad hoc networks","Receivers","Radio transmitters","Abstracts","Mobile ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","outage constraint","channel randomness","channel interference","single-hop transport capacity","connectivity metric","node isolation probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513267","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513267","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","abstract":"In this paper we study two basic properties, capacity and connectivity, of Cognitive Radio networks.

While Uniform Gossip works synchronously on complete graphs, weighted gossip algorithms allow asynchronous rounds and converge on any connected, directed or undirected graph. Unlike most previous gossip algorithms, Weighted Gossip admits stochastic update matrices which need not be doubly stochastic. Double-stochasticity being very restrictive in a distributed setting, this novel degree of freedom is essential and it opens the perspective of designing a large number of new gossip-based algorithms. To give an example, we present one of these algorithms, which we call One-Way Averaging. It is based on random geographic routing, just like Path Averaging, except that routes are one way instead of round trip. Hence in this example, getting rid of double stochasticity allows us to add robustness to Path Averaging.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513273.pdf","startPage":"1753","endPage":"1757","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Gossip: Distributed Averaging using non-doubly stochastic matrices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Routing","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Robustness","Wireless sensor networks","Solid modeling","Lattices","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","matrix algebra","stochastic processes","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nondoubly stochastic matrices","weighted gossip-based distributed averaging algorithm","asynchronous round","directed graph","undirected graph","one way averaging","random geographic routing","path averaging","double stochasticity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Gossip: Distributed Averaging using non-doubly stochastic matrices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513273/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434391","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Gossip: Distributed Averaging using non-doubly stochastic matrices","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05075S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":5513280,"authors":[{"name":"Mortuza Ali","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Mortuza","lastName":"Ali","id":"37084596300"},{"name":"Margreta Kuijper","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Margreta","lastName":"Kuijper","id":"37282995700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513280","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513280","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Decoding","Turbo codes","Cyclic redundancy check","Entropy","Australia","Parity check codes","Channel coding","Guidelines","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","channel coding","parity check codes","Reed-Muller codes","Reed-Solomon codes","source coding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","side information","list decoding","channel codes","LDPC codes","turbo codes","virtual noisy channel","Reed Solomon code","BCH code","Reed-Muller code"]}],"abstract":"Existing literature on source coding with side information (SCSI) uses channel codes like LDPC codes and turbo codes and assumes classical unique decoding. In this paper, in contrast to classical decoding, we have taken the list decoding approach and show that the theoretical limit of SCSI can then be achieved. We argue that, as opposed to channel coding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder can effectively be recovered in case of SCSI with a few CRC bits. The CRC bits, which allow the decoder to identify the correct sequence, incur negligible overhead for large block length. More importantly, these CRC bits are not subject to noise since we are dealing with a virtual noisy channel rather than a real noisy channel. Finally, we present a guideline for designing constructive SCSI schemes using Reed Solomon code, BCH code, and Reed-Muller code, which are the known list-decodable codes.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513280","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513280.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source coding with side information using list decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Source coding with side information using list decoding","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513280/","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513280/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source coding with side information using list decoding","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073956S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513304,"authors":[{"name":"Mayank Bakshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Bakshi","id":"37546164300"},{"name":"Michelle Effros","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Effros","id":"37275255700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513304","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513304","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Feedback","Complexity theory","Computer errors","Region 1","Error probability","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-error source coding","limited feedback","side information","information symbols","nonzero probability","Slepian-Wolf bound","asymptotically lossless coding"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of zero error source coding with limited feedback when side information is present at the receiver.

Finally, we illustrate these results with the aid of three simple examples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513304","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513304.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On zero-error source coding with feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"On zero-error source coding with feedback","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434202","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On zero-error source coding with feedback","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066861S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5513310,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chun Wang","affiliation":["School of ECE, Center for Wireless Systems and Applications (CWSA), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chih-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292502400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513310","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513310","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Broadcasting","Wireless networks","Differential equations","Reservoirs","Unicast","Vectors","Performance analysis","Media Access Protocol","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","channel coding","linear programming","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless one-hop intersession network coding","broadcast packet erasure channel approach","wireless network protocols","intersession network coding","unicast sessions","broadcast packet erasure channels","linear programming solver","index-coding capacity","wireline broadcast","binary alphabets","wireless broadcast","high-order alphabets"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513310","startPage":"1893","endPage":"1897","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of wireless 1-hop intersession network coding \u2014 a broadcast packet erasure channel approach","abstract":"Motivated by practical wireless network protocols, this paper answers the following questions: Exactly (or at most) how much throughput improvement one can expect from intersession network coding (INC) in a 1-hop neighborhood over non-coding solutions; and how to achieve (or approach) the capacity. Focusing on a two-stage setting, this work first provides a capacity outer bound for any number of M coexisting unicast sessions and any overhearing events modeled by broadcast packet erasure channels that are time-wise independently and identically distributed. For M \u2264 3, it is shown that the outer bound meets the capacity. To quantify the tightness of the outer bound for M \u2265 4, a capacity inner bound for general M is provided. Both bounds can be computed by a linear programming solver. Numeric results show that for 4 \u2264 M \u2264 5 with randomly chosen channel parameters, the difference between the outer and inner bounds is within 1% for 99.4% of the times. The results in this paper can also be viewed as the generalization of index-coding capacity from wireline broadcast with binary alphabets to wireless broadcast with high-order alphabets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513310/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434219","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of wireless 1-hop intersession network coding \u2014 a broadcast packet erasure channel approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of wireless 1-hop intersession network coding \u2014 a broadcast packet erasure channel approach","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059321S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513311,"authors":[{"name":"Abhik Das","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Abhik","lastName":"Das","id":"37539444500"},{"name":"Sriram Vishwanath","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Vishwanath","id":"37283401100"},{"name":"Syed Jafar","affiliation":["Department of ECES, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Jafar","id":"37269015800"},{"name":"Athina Markopoulou","affiliation":["Department of ECES, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Athina","lastName":"Markopoulou","id":"37283542100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513311","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network coding for multiple unicasts: An interference alignment approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Unicast","Wireless networks","Vectors","Performance analysis","Telecommunication traffic","Multicast communication","Sufficient conditions","Interference channels","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment","multiple unicast connection","directed acyclic graphs","interference networks","linear network coding","systematic code design","three-source three-destination unicast network","source-destination min-cut"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interference alignment","linear network coding","multiple unicasts"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of network coding for multiple unicast connections in networks represented by directed acyclic graphs.

Most prior work on finding the transmission capacity of ad-hoc networks has focused only on one-way communication where a source communicates with destination and no data is sent from destination to the source. In practice, however, two-way or bidirectional data transmission is required to support control functions like packet acknowledgements and channel feedback. This paper develops the concept of transmission capacity for two-way wireless ad-hoc networks, by incorporating the concept of a two-way outage with different rate requirements in both directions. Upper and lower bounds on the two-way transmission capacity are derived for frequency division duplexing, under the assumption that the channel coefficients are independent on different carrier frequencies. The derived bounds are used to derive the optimal solution for bidirectional bandwidth allocation that maximizes the two-way transmission capacity, which is shown to perform better than allocating bandwidth proportional to the desired rate in both directions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513314.pdf","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1692","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-way transmission capacity of wireless ad-hoc networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Transmitters","Frequency conversion","Wireless networks","Capacity planning","Interference constraints","Data communication","Computer science","Resistance heating","Heat engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","data communication","feedback","frequency division multiplexing","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission capacity","wireless ad-hoc networks","active transmitters","receiver","bidirectional data transmission","packet acknowledgements","channel feedback","frequency division duplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Two-way transmission capacity of wireless ad-hoc networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513314/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434222","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-way transmission capacity of wireless ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060759S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513318,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew R Barron","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew R","lastName":"Barron","id":"37272833300"},{"name":"Antony Joseph","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Antony","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37532235400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513318","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"abstract":"Sparse superposition codes are developed for the additive white Gaussian noise channel with average codeword power constraint.

These examples are further enriched by comparisons with the channel capacity under perfect channel-state information at the receiver, and with the spectral efficiency attained by pilot-based transmission.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513329","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513329.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual information of IID complex Gaussian signals on block Rayleigh-faded channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513329/","displayDocTitle":"Mutual information of IID complex Gaussian signals on block Rayleigh-faded channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434270","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513329/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual information of IID complex Gaussian signals on block Rayleigh-faded channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060898S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5513330,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew R Barron","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew R","lastName":"Barron","id":"37272833300"},{"name":"Antony Joseph","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Antony","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37532235400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513330","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian noise","Decoding","Capacity planning","Vectors","Error probability","Modulation coding","TV","Statistics","Additive noise","Quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","codes","decoding","error statistics","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["additive Gaussian noise channel","average codeword power constraint","sparse superposition codes","adaptive successive decoding","error probability","channel capacity","communication reliability"]}],"abstract":"For the additive Gaussian noise channel with average codeword power constraint, sparse superposition codes and adaptive successive decoding is developed.

Our main result is that for storing a data object of total size M using an (n, k) MDS code over a finite field Fq, up to t1 = \u230a(n - k)/2\u230b errors can be detected, with probability of failure smaller than 1/M, by communicating only O(n(n-k) logM) bits to a trusted verifier. Our result constructs small projections of the data that preserve the errors with high probability and builds on a pseudorandom generator that fools linear functions. The transmission rate achieved by our scheme is asymptotically equal to the min-cut capacity between the source and any receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513354.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1952","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security in distributed storage systems by communicating a logarithmic number of bits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Secure storage","Redundancy","Peer to peer computing","Galois fields","Network servers","Network coding","Object detection","Data security","Internet","Web server"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","file organisation","security of data","virtual storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed storage systems security","logarithmic bits number","encoded distributed storage system","linear hashing scheme","MDS code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Security in distributed storage systems by communicating a logarithmic number of bits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434091","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in distributed storage systems by communicating a logarithmic number of bits","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070533S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513355,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Bagheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Bagheri","id":"37317319000"},{"name":"Abolfazl S.

Most known recovery procedures rely in some form on a special property of the sampling matrix, called the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). It has been shown that random Gaussian matrices possess the RIP and allow an efficient reconstruction of the signal, for instance, by linear programming or by other methods, and similar results are known for the ensembles of random binary matrices. We pursue a link between coding theory and compressed sensing, discussing the construction problem of sampling matrices with short sketches. The best known constructions of \u201csmall-bias probability spaces\u201d (aka codes with narrow distance distribution) account for deterministic sampling matrices with sketch length m = O(k\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n log N/log k) while the best randomized constructions require only m = \u03a9(k log(N/k)) samples, where k is the number of essential entries of the signal.

The BasP allows interpretation as a channel-coding problem, and it guarantees error-free reconstruction with a properly chosen measurement matrix and sufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP performs on a given measurement matrix and develop an algorithm to discover the sparsest vectors for which the BasP fails. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of our previous results on finding the most probable error-patterns degrading performance of a finite size Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code in the error-floor regime. The BasP fails when its output is different from the actual error-pattern. We design a CS-Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA) generating a sparse vector, called a CS-instanton, such that the BasP fails on the CS-instanton, while the BasP recovery is successful for any modification of the CS-instanton replacing a nonzero element by zero. We also prove that, given a sufficiently dense random input for the error-vector, the CS-ISA converges to an instanton in a small finite number of steps. The performance of the CS-ISA is illustrated on a randomly generated 120 \u00d7 512 matrix. For this example, the CS-ISA outputs the shortest instanton (error vector) pattern of length 11.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513360","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513360.pdf","startPage":"1978","endPage":"1982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst configurations (instantons) for Compressed Sensing over reals: A channel coding approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Worst configurations (instantons) for Compressed Sensing over reals: A channel coding approach","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513360/","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434097","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst configurations (instantons) for Compressed Sensing over reals: A channel coding approach","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089943S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513361,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Calderbank","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Calderbank","id":"37283818900"},{"name":"Stephen Howard","affiliation":["DSTO Australia, Edinburgh, Australia"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Howard","id":"37301819700"},{"name":"Sina Jafarpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Jafarpour","id":"37296626500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513361","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":230},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513361","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Image reconstruction","Noise measurement","Compressed sensing","Matching pursuit algorithms","Additive noise","Computer science","Electric variables measurement","Context modeling","Measurement standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Muller codes","signal reconstruction","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse reconstruction","Reed-Muller Sieve","deterministic measurement matrix","compressed sensing","codewords exponentiation","quaternary second order Reed Muller code","fc-sparse vector","local detection algorithm","noise","error bounds","expander-based ensembles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deterministic Compressed Sensing","Model Identification","Local Reconstruction","Second Order Reed Muller Codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces the Reed Muller Sieve, a deterministic measurement matrix for compressed sensing.

Earlier work shows how limited receiver cooperation helps mitigate interference. The scenario with transmitter cooperation, however, is more difficult to tackle. In this paper we study the two-user Gaussian interference channel with conferencing transmitters to make progress towards this direction. We characterize the capacity region to within a constant number of bits regardless of channel parameters. Based on the constant-to-optimality result, we show that there is an interesting reciprocity between the scenario with conferencing transmitters and the scenario with conferencing receivers, and their capacity regions are within a constant gap to each other. Hence in the interference-limited regime, the behavior of the benefit brought by transmitter cooperation is the same as that by receiver cooperation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513366.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference mitigation through limited transmitter cooperation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Interference channels","Wireless networks","MIMO","Wireless communication","Downlink","Cellular networks","Base stations","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio networks","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference mitigation","transmitter cooperation","wireless networks","distributed MIMO systems","two-user Gaussian interference channel","receiver cooperation","channel parameter capacity","conferencing receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation through limited transmitter cooperation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513366/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434103","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation through limited transmitter cooperation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107261S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513367,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Additionally, one can repair a failed node by connecting to any d nodes while downloading \u03b2 units of data from each. Dimakis et al. show that the repair bandwidth d\u03b2 can be considerably reduced if each node stores slightly more than the minimum required and characterize the tradeoff between the amount of storage per node and the repair bandwidth. In the exact regeneration variation, unlike the functional regeneration, the replacement for a failed node is required to store data identical to that in the failed node. This greatly reduces the complexity of system maintenance. The main result of this paper is an explicit construction of codes for all values of the system parameters at one of the two most important and extreme points of the tradeoff the Minimum Bandwidth Regenerating point, which performs optimal exact regeneration of any failed node. A second result is a non-existence proof showing that with one possible exception, no other point on the tradeoff can be achieved for exact regeneration.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513367","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"1938","endPage":"1942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit and optimal exact-regenerating codes for the minimum-bandwidth point in distributed storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Explicit and optimal exact-regenerating codes for the minimum-bandwidth point in distributed storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513367/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434104","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit and optimal exact-regenerating codes for the minimum-bandwidth point in distributed storage","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064566S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513370,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan M.

A parallel block-fading channel model is proposed, that incorporates differences in signalling rates, power scaling and scintillation models between the two carriers. Under this framework, we study the outage probability in the large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. First we consider the case when only the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSIR case) and obtain the SNR exponent for general scintillation distributions. Then we consider the case when perfect CSI is known at both the receiver and transmitter, and derive the optimal power allocation strategy that minimises the outage probability subject to peak and average power constraints. The optimal solution involves non-convex optimisation, which is intractable in practical systems. We therefore propose a suboptimal algorithm that achieves the same diversity as the optimal one and provides significant power savings (on the order of tens of dBs) over uniform allocation.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513382","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513382.pdf","startPage":"2048","endPage":"2052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid free-space optical and radio-frequency communications: Outage analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513382/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid free-space optical and radio-frequency communications: Outage analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434120","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513382/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid free-space optical and radio-frequency communications: Outage analysis","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103537S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513383,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Scheduling selects groups of users according to their channels vector directions and channel quality indicator (CQI). However, when scheduling is applied independently in each cell, the inter-cell interference (ICI) power at each user receiver is random and not known in advance since it changes from slot to slot depending on the scheduling decisions of all interfering base stations. In order to cope with this uncertainty, we consider the joint operation of scheduling, MU-MIMO beamforming and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). We develop a game-theoretic framework for this multi-cell decentralized scheduling problem for which we prove existence of Nash equilibria, and we build on stochastic optimization techniques in order to devise good joint scheduling and ARQ schemes.

Acquiring CSI is often prone to errors and a globally-optimal coordination is not possible when the acquired CSI is imperfect. However, when the errors in the acquired CSI are guaranteed to lie within bounded regions, any quality-of-service (QoS) measure of interest will also lie within a bounded region. Motivated by this premise, by employing the notion of robustness in the worst-case sense, some worst-case guarantees on QoS can be offered.

This paper considers the benefit of designing decodable interference signals by allowing common-private message splitting at the transmitter and common message decoding by users in adjacent cells. In particular, we consider a downlink scenario, where base-stations are equipped with multiple transmit antennas, the remote users are equipped with a single antenna, and multiple remote users are active simultaneously via spatial division multiplexing. We solve a network optimization problem of jointly determining the appropriate users in adjacent cells for rate splitting, the optimal beamforming vectors for both common and private messages, and the optimal common-private rates to minimize the total transmit power across the base-stations subject to service rate requirements for remote users. We observe that for fixed user selection and fixed common-private rate splitting, the optimization of beamforming vectors can be performed using a semidefinite programming approach. Further, this paper proposes a heuristic user-selection and rate splitting strategy to maximize the benefit of common message decoding. Simulation results show that common message decoding can significantly improve both the total transmit power and the feasibility region for cell-edge users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11434128","htmlLink":"/document/5513389/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation with joint beamforming and common message decoding in multicell systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation with joint beamforming and common message decoding in multicell systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058503S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5513392,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-pyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37534485000"},{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513392","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Diversity methods","Throughput","Quality of service","Radio transmitters","Interference","Power control","FCC","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","interference","radio transmitters","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity scaling law","cognitive radio system","multiuser diversity gain","secondary transmitters","interference","primary transmission detection","transmit power control","traffic dynamics"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity scaling law by multiuser diversity in cognitive radio systems","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","endPage":"2092","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513392.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513392","startPage":"2088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513392","abstract":"This paper analyzes the multiuser diversity gain in a cognitive radio (CR) system where secondary transmitters opportunistically utilize the spectrum licensed to primary users only when it is not occupied by the primary users.

We derive the average achievable capacity of the secondary network and analyze its asymptotic behaviors to characterize the multiuser diversity gains in the CR system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11434131","htmlLink":"/document/5513392/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Capacity scaling law by multiuser diversity in cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity scaling law by multiuser diversity in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077059S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513393,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Nourani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Nourani","id":"38557345100"},{"name":"Seyed Abolfazl Motahari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Seyed Abolfazl","lastName":"Motahari","id":"38556591400"},{"name":"Amir K.

The relay stores the received signal during the first time-slot and sends a linearly-transformed version over the next time-slot. Using this scheme, it is shown that Interference Alignment can be done with much less complexity. Having very loose constraints on the channel structure, the proposed method calculates a proper choice for the relay gains such that the M-user IC is able to achieve a DOF of M/2. It is also proved that if the relay's output power scales as P/(log P)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n where P is the power of the transmitters, there is no loss in the achieved DOF. This result is true for all positive and negative ranges of t. In other words, in an M-user IC with quasi-static channel gains, it is possible to achieve M/2 DOF through the use of a MIMO relay whose power grows at a rate slower than that of the transmitters. Similarly, a network of low-power users can benefit from our proposed method if the relay power scales faster than the power of the main transmitters. The results of this paper are valuable when being applied to a practical system. While it is very difficult to use Interference Alignment in M-user IC setup, adding a relay can make alignment more affordable by simplifying the transmitter/receiver structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513393.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"409","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-aided Interference Alignment for the quasi-static interference channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference channels","Transmitters","MIMO","Power system relaying","Resource management","Decoding","Interference constraints","Power generation","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay-aided interference alignment","quasistatic interference channel","degrees of freedom","static environment","MIMO relay","channel structure","M-user interference channel","transmitter structure","receiver structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Relay-aided Interference Alignment for the quasi-static interference channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513393/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434132","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-aided Interference Alignment for the quasi-static interference channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071638S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513394,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy Tannious","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Ramy","lastName":"Tannious","id":"37296127000"},{"name":"Aria Nosratinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Nosratinia","id":"37269740500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513394","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Fading","Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters","Protocols","Throughput","Coherence","Interference","Wireless networks","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","fading channels","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARQ retransmission","fading channel","cognitive radio channel","cognitive transmitter","cognitive link"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of user coexistence in cognitive radio networks operating under fading.

Motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation we formulate non-adaptive group testing problems on graphs. Unlike conventional group testing problems each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper we associate a test with a random walk. In this context conventional group testing corresponds to the special case of a complete graph on n vertices. For interesting classes of graphs we arrive at a rather surprising result, namely, that the number of tests required to identify d defective items is substantially similar to that required in conventional group testing problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph G, we show that with m = O(d\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nT\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n(n) log(n/d)) non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective items.

The new scheme combines flexibility and robustness needed for reliable communications with the user terminal, under a limited feedback constraint. The scheme responds to two major developments in the recent literature: One observation is that it is not so important to approximate the channel but rather the rate itself. The second observation is that a fixed codebook at the transmitter is often better when simultaneously the channel state information is more accurate. Both observations are incorporated in the new scheme where the transmit and feedback codebook are strictly separated and user rates are brought to the base station subject to a controlled uniform error. The analysis provides two astonishing results. First, under perfect channel state information at the transmitter RA outperforms zeroforcing beamforming (ZFBF) for a large fraction of the practically relevant signal-to-noise ratio range for the considered operating point. Second, under a limited feedback constraint the quantization error scaling of RA is shown to be doubly exponentially in the number of feedback bits, whereas the quantization error of ZFBF with random vector quantization was shown by Jindal to scale only exponentially. Simulations sustain our analytic results showing the superior performance of the new scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new robust transmission technique for the multiuser MIMO downlink","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513398","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513398.pdf","startPage":"2123","endPage":"2127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new robust transmission technique for the multiuser MIMO downlink","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513398/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434136","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new robust transmission technique for the multiuser MIMO downlink","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081217S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5513400,"authors":[{"name":"Sh.

The numerical results demonstrate that in a 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO DS-CDMA system with two users per chip, high antenna correlation at the transmitter can double the ergodic spectral efficiency compared to the case of uncorrelated transmit antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of large MIMO DS-CDMA systems with imperfect CSI and spatial correlation","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513401","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513401.pdf","startPage":"2098","endPage":"2102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of large MIMO DS-CDMA systems with imperfect CSI and spatial correlation","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513401/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434139","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of large MIMO DS-CDMA systems with imperfect CSI and spatial correlation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078751S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513404,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Mezghani","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Mezghani","id":"37294420600"},{"name":"Josef A.

In particular, high resolution and high sampling rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are often prohibitively challenging to design. Therefore ADCs for such applications should be low-resolution. This paper provides new insights into the problem of optimal signal detection based on quantized received signals for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. It capitalizes on previous works which extensively analyzed the unquantized linear vector channel using graphical inference methods. In particular, a \u201cloopy\u201d belief propagation-like (BP) MIMO detection algorithm, operating on quantized data with low complexity, is proposed. In addition, we study the impact of finite receiver resolution in fading channels in the large-system limit by means of a state evolution analysis of the BP algorithm, which refers to the limit where the number of transmit and receive antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio. Simulations show that the theoretical findings might give accurate results even with moderate number of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513404","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"2113","endPage":"2117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief propagation based MIMO detection operating on quantized channel output","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Belief propagation based MIMO detection operating on quantized channel output","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513404/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434142","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief propagation based MIMO detection operating on quantized channel output","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067207S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513407,"authors":[{"name":"Yuejie Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yuejie","lastName":"Chi","id":"37403197100"},{"name":"Yiyue Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yiyue","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407321300"},{"name":"Robert Calderbank","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Calderbank","id":"37283818900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513407","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"abstract":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems improve the throughput and reliability of wireless communications. Perfect Channel State Information (CSI) is needed at the receiver to perform coherent detection and achieve the optimal gain of the system. In fast fading and low SNR regimes, it is hard or impossible to obtain perfect CSI, which leads the receiver to operate without knowledge of the CSI and perform blind detection. In reality CSI may be available to the receiver but this CSI may be insufficient to support coherent detection. In this paper, we fill the gap between coherent and blind detection by considering a more realistic model where the receiver knows the statistics of the channel, that is Channel Distribution Information (CDI). We propose a new detection algorithm, called Regularized Blind Detection (RBD), where coherent and blind detection can be viewed as special cases in our model. The algorithm estimates CDI from any training symbols that are available and maximizes performance given the estimated CDI. Simulations demonstrate significant improvement in performance over blind detection. Our work can be viewed as a systematic exploration of space between coherent and blind detection with a strong Bayesian statistic flavor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513407.pdf","startPage":"2108","endPage":"2112","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized blind detection for MIMO communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Space exploration","Throughput","Wireless communication","Channel state information","Performance gain","Fading","Statistical distributions","Detection algorithms","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","blind source separation","MIMO communication","radio receivers","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized blind detection","MIMO communication","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO system","wireless communication throughput","wireless communication reliability","channel state information","receiver","SNR regime","perfect CSI","coherent detection","channel distribution information","Bayesian statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Regularized blind detection for MIMO communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434145","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized blind detection for MIMO communications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053918S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513412,"authors":[{"name":"Desmond W.

This paper studies the max-min weighted SIR problem in the downlink, where multiple users are weighted according to priority and are subject to a total power constraint. The difficulty of this nonconvex problem is compounded by the coupling in the transmit and receive beamformers, thereby making it hard to optimize in a distributed fashion. We first show that this problem can be optimally and efficiently computed using a fast algorithm when the channels are rank-one. The optimal transmit and receive power and beamformers are also derived analytically. We then exploit the MIMO uplink-downlink duality to adapt our algorithm to compute a local optimal solution for channels with general rank.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513412","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513412.pdf","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Max-min weighted SIR for MIMO downlink system: Optimality and algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513412/","displayDocTitle":"Max-min weighted SIR for MIMO downlink system: Optimality and algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434150","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513412/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-min weighted SIR for MIMO downlink system: Optimality and algorithms","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065636S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513414,"authors":[{"name":"Debdeep Chatterjee","affiliation":["Wireless Information Networking Group, Department of ECE, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Debdeep","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37404266400"},{"name":"Tan F.

The complex interactions of the queues at the source node and the M relays (RSs) are modeled as an infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP), whose state space involves the joint queue state (QSI) of the queue at the source node and the queues at the M RSs as well as the joint channel state (CSI) of all S-R links and R-D links. As a first step to address the curse of dimensionality, we propose a reduced state MDP formulation. From the associated Bellman's equation, we show that the delay-optimal power control (and link selection algorithm), which are functions of both the CSI and QSI, has a multi-level water-filling structure. Furthermore, using stochastic learning, we derive a distributive online learning algorithm in which each node recursively estimates a per-node potential function based on real-time observations of the local CSI and local QSI only. We show that the combined distributive learning converges almost surely to a global optimal solution for large arrivals. Finally, we show by simulation that the delay performance of the proposed scheme is significantly better than various baselines such as the conventional CSIT-only control and the throughput optimal control (in stability sense).","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513424","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513424.pdf","startPage":"1843","endPage":"1847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay optimal power control and relay selection for two-hop cooperative OFDM systems via distributive stochastic learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513424/","displayDocTitle":"Delay optimal power control and relay selection for two-hop cooperative OFDM systems via distributive stochastic learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445871","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513424/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay optimal power control and relay selection for two-hop cooperative OFDM systems via distributive stochastic learning","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047202S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513429,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan-Yi Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsuan-Yi","lastName":"Chu","id":"37535901600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513429","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference channels","Degradation","Relays","Decoding","Receivers","Frequency","Memoryless systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cognitive radio","Gaussian channels","protocols","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio channels","interference channel","unidirectional destination cooperation","Gel'fand-Pinkser coding","partial-decode-and-forward strategy","relay channel","Gaussian case channel","receiver"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513429","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513429","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","abstract":"This paper considers the capacity gains due to unidirectional destination cooperation in cognitive radio channels.

It is shown through an example that the rate-region can be strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity region. The coding strategy involves block-Markov superposition coding using Marton's scheme as the starting point. If the message rates in the Marton scheme are too high to be decoded at the end of a block, each receiver is left with a list of messages compatible with its output. In the next block, we send resolution information for each receiver to resolve its list. The key observation is that the resolution information of the first receiver is correlated with that of the second. We transmit this correlated information efficiently in the following block using ideas from the Han-Costa coding scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513432/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434074","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rates for the broadcast channel with feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rates for the broadcast channel with feedback","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056743S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513435,"authors":[{"name":"Mihailo Stojnic","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Mihailo","lastName":"Stojnic","id":"37395583000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513435","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Vectors","Equations","Probability","Algorithm design and analysis","Polynomials","Terminology","Industrial engineering","Length measurement","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recovery thresholds","binary compressed sensing","polynomial \u21131 optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","\u21131 optimization"]}],"abstract":"Recently, theoretically analyzed the success of a polynomial \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization algorithm in solving an under-determined system of linear equations.

In this paper we will present large system expressions for the sum rate for three sub-optimum algorithms, namely the Successive Encoding Successive Allocation Method (SESAM), Block Diagonalization and Block Diagonalization with Dirty Paper Coding. In case the large system limit of the sum rate does not exist, we derive lower bounds.

We propose a unified scheme involving beamforming, water-filling, and diversity coding. The core of the new scheme is a joint FEC coding and linear precoding strategy at the transmitter and an iterative detection process at the receiver.

Using singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding at the transmitter, the MIMO channels are transformed into parallel subchannels. To improve the low diversity order, we propose X- and Y-Codes, prior to SVD precoding, to pair subchannels having different diversity orders. Specifically, a pair of channels is jointly encoded using a 2 \u00d7 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same encoding matrices as X-, Y-Codes, which adapt to each channel realization. The optimal encoding matrices for X- and Y-Codes/Precoders are derived analytically to minimize the average error probability. Finally, we see that X-, Y-Codes/Precoders indeed achieve higher diversity gains at very low encoding/decoding complexity for both well- and ill-conditioned channels, respectively, when compared to other precoding schemes in the literature. We also observe that for the Rayleigh fading channel model X- and Y-Codes/Precoders exhibit the best average error performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513455.pdf","startPage":"2143","endPage":"2147","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X- and Y-Codes for MIMO precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Maximum likelihood decoding","Error probability","Diversity methods","Channel state information","Singular value decomposition","Fading","Degradation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Y-codes","X-codes","MIMO precoding","time division duplex","multiple-input multiple-output system","channel state information","singular value decomposition","transmitter","receiver","average error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDD MIMO","precoding","SVD","diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"X- and Y-Codes for MIMO precoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445953","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X- and Y-Codes for MIMO precoding","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109891S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513457,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Luiz Rebelatto","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o Luiz","lastName":"Rebelatto","id":"37546202100"},{"name":"Bartolomeu F.

The design of the network codes that maximizes the diversity order is recognized as equivalent to the design of linear block codes over a nonbinary finite field under the Hamming metric. The proposed scheme offers a much better tradeoff between rate and diversity order. An outage probability analysis showing the improved performance is carried out, and computer simulations results are shown to agree with the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"943","endPage":"947","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513457.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513457","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Block codes","Relays","Decoding","Broadcasting","Base stations","Galois fields","Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","linear codes","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed network coding","nonbinary linear block code","multiuser cooperative communication","generalized dynamic network code","outage probability analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized distributed network coding based on nonbinary linear block codes for multi-user cooperative communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434330","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513457/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513457/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized distributed network coding based on nonbinary linear block codes for multi-user cooperative communications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085783S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5513461,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Yang","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279519300"},{"name":"Jean-Claude Belfiore","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513461","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Decoding","Space time codes","OFDM modulation","Fading","Telecommunications","Statistics","Channel capacity","MIMO","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","communication complexity","diversity reception","fading channels","multiplexing","protocols","space-time adaptive processing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial diversity recovery","distributed space-time processing","relay networks","time-varying distributed rotation","artificial fast fading channel","time diversity","linear-nonlinear relaying strategy","multiple-antenna two-hop layered networks","rotate-and-forward networks","optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","decode-and-forward scheme","single-antenna multiple-relay channel","low signaling complexity","space-time codes"]}],"abstract":"In relay networks, a conventional way to exploit spatial diversity is to introduce distributed space-time processing at the relays. In our work, we show that even simple time-varying distributed rotation can recover spatial diversity. The main idea is to convert the inherent spatial diversity to time diversity by creating an artificial fast fading channel. It turns out that the proposed framework is both tractable from the theoretical point of view and simple from the practical point of view. Furthermore, the framework is quite general and can be applied to a wide range of linear/nonlinear relaying strategies. As applications, we first propose a linear relaying scheme called rotate-and-forward for multiple-antenna two-hop layered networks. It is shown that, in some non-trivial setting, this scheme outperforms existing schemes and achieves the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. The second application is a decode-and-forward scheme based on the same idea in the single-antenna multiple-relay channel. It is shown to achieve the maximum diversity with low signaling complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed rotation recovers spatial diversity","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513461","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513461.pdf","startPage":"2158","endPage":"2162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed rotation recovers spatial diversity","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513461/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445964","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed rotation recovers spatial diversity","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090608S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513464,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Karmakar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Karmakar","id":"37300825300"},{"name":"Mahesh K.

The characterization of the DMT requires the joint eigenvalue distribution of three specially correlated central Wishart random matrices, which is derived using a related result in. The explicit characterization of the DMT, besides providing the theoretical benchmark for evaluating performance of practical cooperative protocols on this channel, reveals several interesting facts such as: a) the HD operation of the relay fundamentally limits relay channel performance in the sense that the DMT of the full-duplex (FD) relay channel can be strictly greater than that of the HD relay channel; b) an extra antenna at the relay node on a HD relay channel does not always improve the achievable diversity order, unlike that on an FD relay channel. While the fundamental DMTs of the two channels (FD and HD) coincide for a range of low multiplexing gains (MG), this range becomes smaller and the gap between the two (HD and FD) at higher MGs become larger with increasing number of antennas at the relay node, thus potentially justifying the extra cost of an FD relay. It is also proved that the DMTs of the HD and FD (n, 1)-relay channels are the same. Finally, it is shown that the DMT of the (1, m) relay channel can be achieved over different ranges of multiplexing gains by the dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) and the quantize-and-forward (QF) protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513464","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513464.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the symmetric MIMO half-duplex relay channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513464/","displayDocTitle":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the symmetric MIMO half-duplex relay channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434367","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513464/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the symmetric MIMO half-duplex relay channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052357S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513465,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Haghi","affiliation":["Information Systems and Security Lab, Advanced Communications Research Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Haghi","id":"38273664200"},{"name":"Reza Khosravi-Farsani","affiliation":["Information Systems and Security Lab, Advanced Communications Research Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Khosravi-Farsani","id":"38276139400"},{"name":"Mohammad R.

In particular, if the channel is symmetric, both receivers are able to achieve the single-user performance regime.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513470","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513470.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in MIMO Gaussian interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in MIMO Gaussian interference channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513470/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445985","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513470/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in MIMO Gaussian interference channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073441S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513471,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Mohan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Mohan","id":"37546645400"},{"name":"Maryam Fazel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Fazel","id":"37269389600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513471","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Nuclear measurements","Minimization methods","Machine learning","Statistics","Matrix decomposition","Singular value decomposition","Collaboration","Filtering","Tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","matrix algebra","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy low-rank matrix recovery","noisy linear measurements","machine learning","reweighted trace minimization","iterative heuristic approach","nuclear norm minimization","restricted isometry property","compressed sensing","error recovery"]}],"abstract":"The problem of recovering a low-rank matrix consistent with noisy linear measurements is a fundamental problem with applications in machine learning, statistics, and control. Reweighted trace minimization, which extends and improves upon the popular nuclear norm heuristic, has been used as an iterative heuristic for this problem.

We quantify its improvement over nuclear norm minimization by proving tighter bounds on the recovery error for low-rank matrices with noisy measurements.

Hence, the diversity, multiplexing, and array gain (DMA) tradeoff is able to cope with the limitations of the original DMT and provide with operational meaning in the sense that the DMA tradeoff of a particular system can be directly translated into a parameterized characterization of its associated outage probability performance.

The achievability of the DMT is proved by showing that a simple Gaussian superposition coding scheme can achieve a rate region which is within a constant (independent of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) number of bits from an upper bound to the capacity region of the ZIC. We also characterize an achievable DMT of the ZIC with No-CSIT and show that in a small region of multiplexing gains (MG), the full CSIT DMT of the ZIC can be achieved with no CSIT at all.

This paper generalizes the notion of incoherence in the existing literature on model selection and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence-termed as the worst-case coherence and the average coherence-among the columns of a design matrix. In particular, it utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an in-depth analysis of a simple one-step thresholding (OST) algorithm for model selection. One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis is that OST is feasible for model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily verifiable property. In addition, the paper also characterizes the model-selection performance of OST in terms of the worst-case coherence, \u03bc, and establishes that OST performs near-optimally in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime for N \u00d7 C design matrices with \u03bc \u2248 O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1/2</sup>\n). Finally, in contrast to some of the existing literature on model selection, the analysis in the paper is nonasymptotic in nature, it does not require knowledge of the true model order, it is applicable to generic (random or deterministic) design matrices, and it neither requires submatrices of the design matrix to have full rank, nor does it assume a statistical prior on the values of the nonzero entries of the data vector.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513474","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513474.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model selection: Two fundamental measures of coherence and their algorithmic significance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513474/","displayDocTitle":"Model selection: Two fundamental measures of coherence and their algorithmic significance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513474/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model selection: Two fundamental measures of coherence and their algorithmic significance","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073226S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513476,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37289884600"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513476","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"abstract":"The tradeoff between diversity, multiplexing, and delay in multihop MIMO relay networks with ARQ is studied, where the random delay is caused by queueing and ARQ retransmission. This leads to an optimal ARQ allocation problem with a per-hop delay or end-to-end delay constraint. The optimal ARQ allocation has to trade off between the ARQ error that the receiver fails to decode in the allocated maximum ARQ rounds and the packet loss due to queueing delay. These two probability of errors are characterized using the diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff (DMDT) (without queueing) and the tail probability of random delay derived using large deviation techniques, respectively. Then the optimal ARQ allocation problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. We show that the optimal ARQ allocation should balance each link performance as well as avoid significant queue delay, which is also demonstrated by numerical examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513476.pdf","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2212","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoffs in MIMO multihop networks with ARQ","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Automatic repeat request","Delay","Relays","Protocols","Information analysis","Decoding","Tail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","convex programming","delays","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","multiplexing","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff","multihop MIMO relay networks","random delay","ARQ retransmission","optimal ARQ allocation","end-to-end delay constraint","ARQ error","receiver","packet loss","queueing delay","error probability","deviation technique","convex optimization","automatic repeat request"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoffs in MIMO multihop networks with ARQ","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446005","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoffs in MIMO multihop networks with ARQ","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047665S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513479,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Elia","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Elia","id":"37295919600"},{"name":"Joakim Jald\u00e9n","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Jald\u00e9n","id":"37284731500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513479","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Decoding","Computational complexity","Power measurement","Gain measurement","Diversity methods","Cost function","Lattices","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","MIMO communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-reliability-complexity limits","outage limited MIMO communications","computational complexity","multiple-input multiple-output communications","complexity regulating policies","encoder-decoder designs","optimal diversity gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","complexity","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","space-time coders-decoders","fundamental limits","lattice reduction","regularization"]}],"abstract":"The work establishes fundamental limits between rate, reliability and computational complexity, for the general setting of outage-limited MIMO communications.

Finally the tradeoff's simple nature, renders it useful for insightful comparison of the rate-reliability-complexity capabilities for different encoders-decoders.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental rate-reliability-complexity limits in outage limited MIMO communications","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513479","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513479.pdf","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental rate-reliability-complexity limits in outage limited MIMO communications","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513479/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental rate-reliability-complexity limits in outage limited MIMO communications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065941S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513482,"authors":[{"name":"Li Peng","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Peng","id":"37531165000"},{"name":"Albert Guill\u00e9n i F\u00e0bregas","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Guill\u00e9n i F\u00e0bregas","id":"37284014200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513482","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Fading","Delay","Measurement","Channel state information","Wireless communication","OFDM","Spread spectrum communication","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","distortion","fading channels","MIMO communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion outage probability","MIMO block-fading channels","analogue source transmission","receiver-only channel state information","end-to-end expected distortion","figure of merit","coding scheme","source-channel separation","expected distortion approach","transmitter informed lower bound"]}],"abstract":"We study analogue source transmission over MIMO block-fading channels with receiver-only channel state information.

The general case is considered where the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) at each receiver scales differently from the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receivers. The achievability of the DMT is proved by showing that a simple Han-Kobayashi coding scheme can achieve a rate region which is within a constant (independent of SNR) number of bits from a set of upper bounds to the capacity region of the IC. In general, only part of the DMT curve with CSIT can be achieved by coding schemes which do not use any CSIT (No-CSIT). A result in this paper establishes a threshold for the INR beyond which the DMT with CSIT coincides with that with No-CSIT. Our result also settles one of the conjectures made in. Furthermore, the fundamental DMT of a class of non-symmetric ICs with No-CSIT is also obtained wherein the two receivers have different numbers of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513484","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513484.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"2213","endPage":"2217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the symmetric MIMO 2-user interference channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the symmetric MIMO 2-user interference channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513484/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446026","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513484/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the symmetric MIMO 2-user interference channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069506S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513485,"authors":[{"name":"Georgy Levin","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Georgy","lastName":"Levin","id":"37267834600"},{"name":"Sergey Loyka","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Loyka","id":"37276601300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513485","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"abstract":"MIMO single-relay fading channels are studied, where the source and destination are equipped with multiple antennas and the relay has a single one. Compact closed-form expressions are obtained for the outage probability under i.i.d. and correlated Rayleigh-fading links. Insightful high-SNR approximations are derived, which show the impact of the number of antennas, correlation, relay noise, relaying protocol, etc. Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is obtained for a broad class of fading distributions, including, as special cases, Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami, Weibull, which may be non-identical, spatially correlated and/or non-zero mean. The DMT is shown to depend not on a particular fading distribution, but rather on its polynomial behavior near zero. It turns out to be the same for the simple \u201camplify-and-forward\u201d protocol and more complicated \u201cdecode-and-forward\u201d one with capacity achieving codes, i.e. the full processing capability at the relay does not help to improve the DMT. However, we also emphasize significant difference between the SNR-asymptotic DMT and the finite-SNR outage performance: while the former is not improved by using an extra antenna on either side, the latter can be significantly improved and, in particular, an extra antenna can be traded-off for a full processing capability at the relay.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513485.pdf","startPage":"2218","endPage":"2222","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and outage probability in MIMO relay channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","Protocols","Weibull fading channels","Closed-form solution","Nakagami distribution","Polynomials","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","MIMO communication","Nakagami channels","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","outage probability","MIMO single-relay fading channels","multiple antennas","Rayleigh-fading links","relaying protocol","relay noise","Rice channels","Nakagami channels","Weibull channels","amplify-and-forward protocol","decode-and-forward","capacity achieving codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and outage probability in MIMO relay channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434400","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and outage probability in MIMO relay channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05097S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513489,"authors":[{"name":"Jarvis Haupt","affiliation":["Rice University, USA"],"firstName":"Jarvis","lastName":"Haupt","id":"37294263500"},{"name":"Rui Castro","affiliation":["Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Castro","id":"37283436800"},{"name":"Robert Nowak","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37265271600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513489","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Extraterrestrial measurements","Sampling methods","Machine learning","Noise measurement","Gaussian noise","Signal analysis","Signal detection","Signal sampling","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","signal detection","signal sampling","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse recovery","adaptive measurements","white Gaussian noise","adaptive sampling","distilled sensing","signal detection","signal localization"]}],"abstract":"It is shown here that adaptivity in sampling results in dramatic improvements in the recovery of sparse signals in white Gaussian noise.

There are numerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels. Recently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for DPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that defines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for channel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent literature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching shaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder works on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high complexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC scheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at both the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit shaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The crucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of the bits at the transmitter, which enables an LDPC decoder to be run first at the receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the proposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an application of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition coding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513493","startPage":"923","endPage":"927","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513493.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dirty paper coding using sign-bit shaping and LDPC codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dirty paper coding using sign-bit shaping and LDPC codes","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513493/","accessionNumber":"11446056","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513493/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dirty paper coding using sign-bit shaping and LDPC codes","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049095S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5513497,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Abediseid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Abediseid","id":"37546158500"},{"name":"Mohamed Oussama Damen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed Oussama","lastName":"Damen","id":"37266498600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513497","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","MIMO","Performance analysis","Maximum likelihood decoding","Computational complexity","Signal to noise ratio","Random variables","Fading","Symmetric matrices","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiplexing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice sequential decoder","coded MIMO channel","complexity analysis","nested lattice codes","optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance limits and computational complexity of lattice sequential decoder for coded MIMO channel are analyzed.

We apply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to generate a list of channel estimates (LCE) that maximizes the a posteriori probabilities of the transmitted data, given the received signal and the soft feedback from the channel decoder. The LCE is refined over each iteration of data detection and decoding to facilitate improved channel estimation and thus yields superior detection performance. It is shown that, even with a small list size, the proposed MCMC-LCE detector outperforms the coherent detector in which data detection is performed based on a single channel estimate (SCE). As opposed to the noncoherent detectors which impose stringent constraints on the fading distribution, the MCMC-LCE detector is applicable to general fading distributions. It also offers a low complexity that is linear in the coherent length of the channel and the list size.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513499.pdf","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2242","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative data detection and decoding using list channel estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative data detection and decoding using list channel estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo","htmlLink":"/document/5513499/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11445874","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative data detection and decoding using list channel estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069167S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5513508,"authors":[{"name":"Mayank Bakshi","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Bakshi","id":"37546164300"},{"name":"Sidharth Jaggi","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sidharth","lastName":"Jaggi","id":"37283939600"},{"name":"Michelle Effros","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Effros","id":"37275255700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513508","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1467},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513508","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Computational complexity","Reed-Solomon codes","Decoding","Channel coding","Source coding","Computer errors","Costs","Memoryless systems","Rate-distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","concatenated codes","error statistics","information theory","Reed-Solomon codes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated polar codes","information-theoretic problem","error probability","short polar code","high-rate Reed-Solomon code","point-to-point channel coding","multiple-input multiple output channel coding","network source coding problem"]}],"abstract":"Polar codes have attracted much recent attention as one of the first codes with low computational complexity that provably achieve optimal rate-regions for a large class of information-theoretic problems. One significant drawback, however, is that for current constructions the probability of error decays sub-exponentially in the block-length more detailed designs improve the probability of error at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity. In this work we show how the the classical idea of code concatenation - using \"short\" polar codes as inner codes and a \"high-rate\" Reed-Solomon code as the outer code - results in substantially improved performance. In particular, code concatenation with a careful choice of parameters boosts the rate of decay of the probability of error to almost exponential in the block-length with essentially no loss in computational complexity. We demonstrate such performance improvements for three sets of information-theoretic problems - a classical point-to-point channel coding problem, a class of multiple-input multiple output channel coding problems, and some network source coding problems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513508","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513508.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenated Polar codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Concatenated Polar codes","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513508/","accessionNumber":"11434206","publicationDate":"June 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenated Polar codes","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055995S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513510,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Gupta","affiliation":["Samsung Telecommunications of America, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37309188500"},{"name":"Robert Nowak","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37265271600"},{"name":"Benjamin Recht","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Recht","id":"37265897700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513510","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Dynamic range","Adaptive algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing","Gaussian noise","Telecommunication computing","Electric variables measurement","Noise measurement","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","encoding","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample complexity","1-bit compressed sensing","sparse classification","high-dimensional sparse vector","noise-corrupted 1-bit measurements","O(d log(D)) measurements","word length 1 bit"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of identifying the support set of a high-dimensional sparse vector, from noise-corrupted 1-bit measurements.

This is the wiretap channel model introduced by Wyner in 1975. The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for Alice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in terms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security is measured in terms of the ratio of Eve's equivocation about the message to its a priori entropy.

However, his proof of this result is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument.

The question addressed in this paper is whether an even smaller number of samples is sufficient when there exists prior knowledge about the distribution of the unknown vector, or when only partial recovery is needed. An information-theoretic lower bound with connections to free probability theory and an upper bound corresponding to a computationally simple thresholding estimator are derived.

Recently, it has been shown that a convex program, named Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), can recover the low-rank matrix when the data matrix is corrupted by gross sparse errors. We further prove that the solution to a related convex program (a relaxed PCP) gives an estimate of the low-rank matrix that is simultaneously stable to small entry-wise noise and robust to gross sparse errors. More precisely, our result shows that the proposed convex program recovers the low-rank matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted, with an error bound proportional to the noise level. We present simulation results to support our result and demonstrate that the new convex program accurately recovers the principal components (the low-rank matrix) under quite broad conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first result that shows the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), optimal for small i.i.d. noise, can be made robust to gross sparse errors; or the first that shows the newly proposed PCP can be made stable to small entry-wise perturbations.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513535","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Principal component analysis","Data engineering","Noise robustness","Data mining","Mathematics","Asia","Error analysis","Noise level","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable principal component pursuit","data matrix","gross sparse errors","convex program","principal component analysis"]}],"publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513535.pdf","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513535","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable Principal Component Pursuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513535/","displayDocTitle":"Stable Principal Component Pursuit","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434278","htmlLink":"/document/5513535/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable Principal Component Pursuit","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059907S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5513543,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiyin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shuiyin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538548600"},{"name":"Cong Ling","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Ling","id":"37275770000"},{"name":"Damien Stehl\u00e9","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Stehl\u00e9","id":"37418526000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513543","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Maximum likelihood decoding","Performance analysis","MIMO","Educational institutions","Detectors","Mathematics","Statistics","Maximum likelihood estimation","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomized lattice decoding","sphere decoding","maximum-likelihood performance","exponential complexity","lattice reduction-aided decoding","Klein randomized algorithm","Babai nearest plane algorithm","random rounding"]}],"abstract":"Sphere decoding achieves maximum-likelihood (ML) performance at the cost of exponential complexity; lattice reduction-aided decoding significantly reduces the decoding complexity, but exhibits a widening gap to ML performance as the dimension increases.

This paper considers the problem where each receiver knows its channels from all the transmitters and feeds back this information using a limited number of bits to all other terminals. In particular, channel quantization over the composite Grassmann manifold is proposed and analyzed. It is shown, for K-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels, that when the transmitters use an interference alignment strategy as if the quantized channel estimates obtained via this limited feedback are perfect, the full sum degrees of freedom of the interference channel can be achieved as long as the feedback bit rate scales sufficiently fast with the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, this is only one extreme point of a continuous tradeoff between the achievable degrees of freedom region and user feedback rate scalings which are allowed to be non-identical. It is seen that a slower scaling of feedback rate for any one user leads to commensurately fewer degrees of freedom for that user alone.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513544","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"619","endPage":"623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment under limited feedback for MIMO interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment under limited feedback for MIMO interference channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513544/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434314","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513544/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment under limited feedback for MIMO interference channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090393S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513550,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ali","lastName":"Maddah-Ali","id":"38277817700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513550","dbTime":"88 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"abstract":"We consider compound multiple-antenna broadcast channels with M transmit antennas and K single-antenna receivers, where the channel of receiver r takes one of J\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n complex vectors.

We assume that both the transmitters use a linear beamforming scheme for signaling and the users treat interference as noise. The links are assumed to be spatially correlated and the focus is on understanding the structure of the beamforming vectors that maximize the average sum-rate as a function of the statistics of all the channels and the SNR level at both the transmitters. Building on recent work that studies Pareto optimality in a similar context, we show that (from the class of linear beamforming schemes) a rank-1 beamformer is always optimal when both the transmitters are of low-SNR. In general, the rank of the optimal beamforming matrix is a complicated function of the SNRs and channel statistics. Nevertheless, it is shown that the high-SNR optimal rank-1 beamformer is the generalized eigenvector of the two links as seen from each transmitter.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"2278","endPage":"2282","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513551.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical beamformer design for the two-antenna interference channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513551/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical beamformer design for the two-antenna interference channel","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445957","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical beamformer design for the two-antenna interference channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050621S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5513553,"authors":[{"name":"Vasanthan Raghavan","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Vasanthan","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37285687800"},{"name":"Venugopal Veeravalli","affiliation":["University of Illinois, USA"],"firstName":"Venugopal","lastName":"Veeravalli","id":"37275175200"},{"name":"Stephen Hanly","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Hanly","id":"37269071600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513553","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"A spatially correlated broadcast setting with M antennas at the base station and M users (each with a single antenna) is considered. We assume that the users have perfect channel information about their links and the base station has only statistical information about each user's link. The base station employs a linear beamforming strategy with one spatial eigen-mode allocated to each user. The goal of this work is to understand the structure of the beamforming vectors that maximize the ergodic sum-rate achieved by treating interference as noise. In the M = 2 case, we first fix the beamforming vectors and compute the ergodic sum-rate in closed-form as a function of the channel statistics. We then show that the optimal beamforming vectors are the dominant generalized eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the two links. It is difficult to obtain intuition on the structure of the optimal beamforming vectors for M > 2 due to the complicated nature of the sum-rate expression. Nevertheless, in the case of asymptotic M, we show that the optimal beamforming vectors have to satisfy a set of fixed-point equations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513553.pdf","startPage":"2268","endPage":"2272","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear beamforming for the spatially correlated MISO broadcast channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Broadcasting","Covariance matrix","Base stations","Statistics","Vectors","Interference","Rayleigh channels","Equations","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","interference (signal)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear beamforming strategy","spatially correlated MISO broadcast channel","beamforming vectors","ergodic sum-rate","fixed-point equations","covariance matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Linear beamforming for the spatially correlated MISO broadcast channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513553/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434332","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear beamforming for the spatially correlated MISO broadcast channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062754S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5513555,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Karzand","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Karzand","id":"38558598700"},{"name":"Emre Telatar","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Telatar","id":"38559367700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513555","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":909},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Decoding","Polarization","Channel coding","Memoryless systems","Rate-distortion","Arithmetic","Error probability","Noise level","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","combined source-channel coding","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar codes","q-ary source coding","channel coding technique","binary-input memoryless channel symmetric capacity","symmetric rate distortion bound","binary representation alphabet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513555","abstract":"Polar coding is a recent channel coding technique invented by Arikan to achieve the 'symmetric capacity' of binary-input memoryless channels.

For non-causal case, we establish an achievable rate region using Gel'fand-Pinsker type coding scheme at the nodes informed of CSI, and Compress-and-Forward (CF) scheme at the relay. Using Shannon's strategy and CF scheme, an achievable rate region for causal case is obtained. As an example, the Gaussian version of SD-RCPM is considered, and an achievable rate region for Gaussian SD-RCPM with non-causal perfect CSI only at the source, is derived.

Existing coding strategies, i.e., complete-decode-forward and compress-forward are shown to be bounded away from the cut-set upper bound at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). It is known that the gap between the compress-forward rate and the capacity upper bound is a constant at high SNR, and that between the complete-decode-forward rate and the upper bound increases with SNR at high SNR. In this paper, a functional-decode-forward coding strategy is proposed. It is shown that for L \u2265 3, complete-decode-forward achieves the capacity when SNR \u2264 0 dB, and functional-decode-forward achieves the capacity when SNR \u2265 0 dB. For L = 2, functional-decode-forward achieves the capacity asymptotically as SNR increases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"664","endPage":"668","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513576.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Theorems for the AWGN multi-way relay channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513576/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Theorems for the AWGN multi-way relay channel","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446011","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Theorems for the AWGN multi-way relay channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13022S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513577,"authors":[{"name":"Ayfer \u00d6zg\u00fcr","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ayfer","lastName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","id":"37400270700"},{"name":"Suhas Diggavi","affiliation":["UCLA, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Suhas","lastName":"Diggavi","id":"37269046100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513577","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"abstract":"Recently, it has been shown that a quantize-map-and-forward scheme approximately achieves (within a constant number of bits) the Gaussian relay network capacity for arbitrary topologies.

Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed to date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of convolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism which explains why \u201cconvolutional-like\u201d or \u201cspatially coupled\u201d codes perform so well. In essence, the spatial coupling of the individual code structure has the effect of increasing the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble to its maximum possible value, namely the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. For this reason we call this phenomenon \u201cthreshold saturation\u201d. This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One significant advantage of such a construction is that one can create capacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius which is increasing in the blocklength. Our proof makes use of the area theorem of the BP-EXIT curve and the connection between the MAP and BP threshold recently pointed out by M\u00e9asson, Montanari, Richardson, and Urbanke. Although we prove the connection between the MAP and the BP threshold only for a very specific ensemble and only for the binary erasure channel, empirically the same statement holds for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More generally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar collapse of thresholds occurs once individual components are coupled sufficiently strongly. This might give rise to improved algorithms as well as to new techniques for analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513587","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513587.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold saturation via spatial coupling: Why convolutional LDPC ensembles perform so well over the BEC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Threshold saturation via spatial coupling: Why convolutional LDPC ensembles perform so well over the BEC","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513587/","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446060","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513587/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold saturation via spatial coupling: Why convolutional LDPC ensembles perform so well over the BEC","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084978S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513589,"authors":[{"name":"Jossy Sayir","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Jossy","lastName":"Sayir","id":"37284748100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513589","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Probability distribution","Parity check codes","Algorithm design and analysis","Statistical analysis","Information analysis","Iterative decoding","Sum product algorithm","Frequency estimation","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","error correction","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","parity check codes","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EXIT chart approximation","role model","extrinsic information transfer function","statistical method","a-posteriori distribution","mixed information","message alphabet size","probability distribution","rank-only message passing decoder","Bayesian post-processing estimator","nonbinary low-density parity-check decoder"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EXIT chart approximations using the role model approach","startPage":"694","endPage":"698","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513589.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513589","abstract":"Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) functions can be measured by statistical methods if the message alphabet size is moderate or if messages are true a-posteriori distributions.

This connection is established via the entropy rate of some random walk that is associated with this pseudo-codeword, this random walk being an object of interest by itself.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connecting the Bethe entropy and the edge zeta function of a cycle code","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513594","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513594.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Connecting the Bethe entropy and the edge zeta function of a cycle code","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513594/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445877","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connecting the Bethe entropy and the edge zeta function of a cycle code","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069299S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5513595,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lentmaier","affiliation":["Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lentmaier","id":"37283339900"},{"name":"Gerhard P.

The liftings are designed to eliminate dominant trapping sets of the base code by removing the short cycles which form the trapping sets. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the cyclic permutations assigned to the edges of a cycle c of length \u2113(c) in the base graph such that the inverse image of c in the lifted graph consists of only cycles of length strictly larger than \u2113(c). The proposed method is universal in the sense that it can be applied to any LDPC code over any channel and for any iterative decoding algorithm. It also preserves important properties of the base code such as degree distributions. The proposed method is applied to both structured and random codes over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The error floor improves consistently by increasing the lifting degree, and the results show significant improvements in the error floor compared to the base code, a random code of the same degree distribution and block length, and a random lifting of the same degree. Similar improvements are also observed when the codes designed for the BSC are applied to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513605","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513605.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lowering the error floor of LDPC codes using cyclic liftings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Lowering the error floor of LDPC codes using cyclic liftings","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513605/","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434211","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513605/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowering the error floor of LDPC codes using cyclic liftings","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064761S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5513606,"authors":[{"name":"Yihong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37075723500"},{"name":"Sergio Verd\u00fa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verd\u00fa","id":"37274351500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513606","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional properties of MMSE","abstract":"We show that the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) of estimating the input based on the channel output is a concave functional of the input-output joint distribution, and its various regularity properties are explored.

In some cases even with a small message set, these decoders can guarantee correction of a higher number of errors than BP and min-sum. We provide particularly good 3-bit decoders for 3-left-regular LDPC codes. They significantly outperform the BP and min-sum decoders, but more importantly, they achieve this at only a fraction of the complexity of the BP and min-sum decoders.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513620","startPage":"769","endPage":"773","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513620.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel decoders surpassing belief propagation on the binary symmetric channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513620/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel decoders surpassing belief propagation on the binary symmetric channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11434258","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513620/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel decoders surpassing belief propagation on the binary symmetric channel","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106165S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513621,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406726800"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"},{"name":"Xinmei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xinmei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281379300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513621","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","Parity check codes","Galois fields","Equations","Quantum cascade lasers","Two dimensional displays","Chaos","Concrete","Iterative decoding","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","finite fields","maximum distance separable code","generalized Reed-Solomon code","parity-check matrices","sum-product algorithm","low-density parity-check","decoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we first propose a general framework for constructing quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes based on a two-dimensional (2-D) maximum distance separable (MDS) code. Two classes of QC-LDPC codes are defined, whose parity-check matrices are transposes of each other. We then use a 2-D generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) code to give a concrete construction. The decoding parity-check matrices have a large number of redundant parity-check equations while their Tanner graphs have a girth of at least 6. The minimum distances of the codes are very respectable as far as LDPC codes are concerned. We further show that many existing constructions of QC-LDPC codes based on finite fields in the literature can be unified under this construction. Experimental studies show that the constructed QC-LDPC codes perform well with the sum-product algorithm (SPA).","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513621","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513621.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"839","endPage":"843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional generalized Reed-Solomon codes: A unified framework for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes constructed based on finite fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional generalized Reed-Solomon codes: A unified framework for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes constructed based on finite fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513621/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434259","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513621/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional generalized Reed-Solomon codes: A unified framework for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes constructed based on finite fields","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061269S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513622,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e8al, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Roy","id":"37411465800"},{"name":"Christian Cardinal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e8al, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Cardinal","id":"37266589500"},{"name":"David Haccoun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e8al, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Haccoun","id":"37276818400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513622","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Feedback","Iterative algorithms","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","AWGN channels","Computer simulation","Shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","iterative decoding","orthogonal codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive convolutional codes","time-invariant LDPC convolutional codes","time-invariant low-density parity-check convolutional codes","coding rate","recursive convolutional doubly orthogonal encoders","RCDO encoders","Tanner graph","threshold decoder","iterative decoder convergence behaviour"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","capacity","convolutional codes","doubly-orthogonal conditons","iterative decoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an attractive alternative to construct time-invariant Low-Density Parity-Check Convolutional Codes (LDPC-CC) of coding rate-b/c from a simple recursive systematic convolutional encoder design.

Therefore, RCDO encoders can be decoded using simply a cascade of the same threshold decoder. The convergence behavior of the iterative decoder is then controlled by the position and by the number of forward and feedback connections that constitute the encoder.

Whereas nested lattice codes have been proposed recently for continuous-input channels, in this paper we focus on the construction of nested linear codes for joint channel-network coding problems based on algebraic photograph LDPC codes. In particular, over the past few years several constructions of codes have been proposed that are based on random lifts of suitably chosen base graphs. More recently, an algebraic analog of this approach was introduced using the theory of voltage graphs. In this paper we illustrate how these methods can be used in the construction of nested codes from algebraic lifts of graphs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513628/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11434280","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513628/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic constructions of graph-based nested codes from protographs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic constructions of graph-based nested codes from protographs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097091S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513629,"authors":[{"name":"Maja Ostojic","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Ostojic","id":"37545590000"},{"name":"Hans-Andrea Loeliger","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hans-Andrea","lastName":"Loeliger","id":"37269552300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513629","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Linear code","Message passing","Tree graphs","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Information technology","Code standards","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitree decoding","multitree-aided LDPC decoding","general binary linear codes","maximum-likelihood performance","low-density parity check codes","standard sum-product message passing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513629","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513629.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitree decoding and multitree-aided LDPC decoding","abstract":"New decoding algorithms for linear codes are proposed.

However, in this paper, we show that every LDPC-CC with RPCM can be associated with an equivalent Tanner graph which can avoid the infinite memory order and undesired short length cycles but still implements the same constraints specified by the RPCM. Together with the iterative decoding based on belief propagation with proper scheduling, simulation results indicate that LDPC-CC with RPCM can also provide satisfactory decoding performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Convolutional codes","Iterative decoding","Pipelines","Delay","Belief propagation","Very large scale integration","Polynomials","Guidelines","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","decoding","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC convolutional codes","rational parity check matrices","low density parity check convolutional codes","decoding latency/complexity","infinite memory order","bit error rate performance","Tanner graph","belief propagation","satisfactory decoding performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513631","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513631","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513631.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513631","startPage":"789","endPage":"793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding of LDPC convolutional codes with rational parity-check matrices from a new graphical perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoding of LDPC convolutional codes with rational parity-check matrices from a new graphical perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513631/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513631/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445924","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding of LDPC convolutional codes with rational parity-check matrices from a new graphical perspective","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079364S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513632,"authors":[{"name":"Xuepeng Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuepeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37384963800"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513632","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Modulation coding","Detectors","Signal detection","Computational complexity","System performance","Convergence","Sum product algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","message passing","modulation coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity joint detection-decoding algorithm","nonbinary LDPC-coded modulation systems","hard-decision decoding","message-passing strategy","signal detector","computational complexity","q-ary sum-product algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a low-complexity joint detection-decoding algorithm for nonbinary LDPC coded-modulation systems.

In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the input signal from the output of an additive white Gaussian channel whose gain is fixed, but unknown. The input distribution is known, and the estimation process consists of two algorithms. First, a channel estimator blindly estimates the channel gain using past observations. Second, a mismatched MMSE estimator, optimized for the estimated channel gain, estimates the input signal. We analyze the regret, i.e., the additional mean square error, that is raised in this process. We derive upper-bounds on both absolute and relative regrets. Bounds are expressed in terms of the Fisher information. We also study regret for unbiased, efficient channel estimators, and derive a simple trade-off between Fisher information and relative regret. This trade-off shows that the product of a certain function of relative regret and Fisher information equals the signal-to-noise ratio, independent of the input distribution. The trade-off relation implies that higher Fisher information results to smaller expected relative regret.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513634","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513634.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513634","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"1408","endPage":"1412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On regret of parametric mismatch in minimum mean square error estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"On regret of parametric mismatch in minimum mean square error estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513634/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445933","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On regret of parametric mismatch in minimum mean square error estimation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043576S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513635,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Chile, Chile"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Silva","id":"37290443000"},{"name":"Shrikanth S.

First, it can be used with any exponential family distribution over the cliques in the graph. Second, it can impose additional constraints on the marginal distributions. We use this second property to impose pair-wise marginal distribution constraints in some check nodes of the LDPC Tanner graph. These additional constraints allow decoding the received codeword when the BP decoder gets stuck. In this paper, we first present the new decoding algorithm, whose complexity is identical to the BP decoder, and we then prove that it is able to decode codewords with a larger fraction of erasures, as the block size tends to infinity. The proposed algorithm can be also understood as a simplification of the Maxwell decoder, but without its computational complexity. We also illustrate that the new algorithm outperforms the BP decoder for finite block-size codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree-structure expectation propagation for decoding LDPC codes over binary erasure channels","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513636","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513636.pdf","startPage":"799","endPage":"803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Tree-structure expectation propagation for decoding LDPC codes over binary erasure channels","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513636/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434301","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-structure expectation propagation for decoding LDPC codes over binary erasure channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048064S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513638,"authors":[{"name":"Brian K.

An explicit formulation is also given for the transmit covariance matrices, at each frequency, that reach the boundary of the rate region. From the compact expression of these matrices, suboptimal iterative algorithms emerge that allow the multiple access users to derive autonomously the transmit covariance matrices. This comes at the sole expense of a small amount of signalling overhead, which is constant irrespectively of the number of antennas. Simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical derivations and suggest rather good behavior of the suboptimal self-organization algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513642.pdf","startPage":"2303","endPage":"2307","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organized spectrum sharing in large MIMO multiple-access channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Covariance matrix","Base stations","Transmitting antennas","Frequency","Fading","Bandwidth","Iterative algorithms","Receiving antennas","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","iterative methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self organized spectrum sharing","MIMO multiple access channels","covariance matrices","base station","suboptimal iterative algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-organized spectrum sharing in large MIMO multiple-access channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445946","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organized spectrum sharing in large MIMO multiple-access channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069228S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513646,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In the framework of interference alignment, each receiver maintains an interference subspace. The transmitters shape their transmissions such that all the interference seen at a particular receiver falls into its interference subspace, hence allowing the remaining receiver space to be used for reception of the useful signal. In contrast to previously proposed iterative interference alignment algorithms for the general interference channel, our proposed technique not only minimizes the interference power that is spilled outside the interference subspace, but also minimizes the signal power that is spilled over into the interference subspace. A weighted optimization technique is proposed to tradeoff between the relative importance associated with the leakage interference and the leakage signal powers. It is proven that the algorithm converges monotonically, and simulation results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms other known algorithms in terms of throughput. Further discussions on generalizing the algorithm are also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513646.pdf","startPage":"2293","endPage":"2297","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative algorithm for joint signal and interference alignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Transmitters","Interference channels","Signal to noise ratio","Signal design","Shape","Throughput","Bandwidth","Distributed algorithms","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","signal processing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference subspace channel","transmitters","receiver","receiver space","signal reception","iterative interference alignment algorithms","weighted optimization technique","leakage interference","leakage signal powers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"An iterative algorithm for joint signal and interference alignment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513646/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434335","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative algorithm for joint signal and interference alignment","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059768S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5513647,"authors":[{"name":"Pasquale Memmolo","affiliation":["Universit\u00e1 Degli Studi di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Memmolo","id":"37546555700"},{"name":"Marco Lops","affiliation":["Institut National Polytechnique Toulouse/IRIT & DAEIMI, University of Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Lops","id":"37268086700"},{"name":"Antonia M.

We propose a partial zero-forcing precoding strategy based on a shared-private rate splitting scheme at the transmitter, in which each transmitter communicates part of its message to the other transmitter, and subsequently partially pre-subtracts the interfering signal using a zero-forcing precoder. We prove an outer bound and show that the proposed strategy is asymptotically sum-capacity achieving in a very weak interference regime, where both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) go to infinity while their ratio in dB scale is kept fixed. In this case, every cooperation bit results in one-bit gain in sum capacity. We also consider a different asymptotic regime where the transmit power constraints and the channel gains are fixed while the noise powers go down to zero. In this case, if one compares with the achievable sum rate with interference treated as noise, one cooperation bit can in fact result in more than one-bit gain in achievable sum rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513651.pdf","startPage":"2283","endPage":"2287","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial zero-forcing precoding for the interference channel with partially cooperating transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Radio transmitters","Decoding","Gaussian noise","Signal to noise ratio","Electronic mail","H infinity control","Interference constraints","Radio broadcasting","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","Gaussian channels","interference (signal)","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial zero forcing precoding","Gaussian interference channel","signal-to-noise ratio","interference-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Partial zero-forcing precoding for the interference channel with partially cooperating transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513651/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445967","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial zero-forcing precoding for the interference channel with partially cooperating transmitters","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057967S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5513659,"authors":[{"name":"Augusto Aubry","affiliation":["Universit\u00e1 Degli Studi di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Aubry","id":"37393675700"},{"name":"Antonia M.

Finally, we also investigate the low-SNR regime, specifically analyzing the minimum required energy per information bit and the wideband slope region.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513659","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513659.pdf","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-access channel capacity region with incomplete channel state information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513659/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-access channel capacity region with incomplete channel state information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445976","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513659/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-access channel capacity region with incomplete channel state information","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072743S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5513662,"authors":[{"name":"Eitan Yaakobi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Yaakobi","id":"37546078500"},{"name":"Tuvi Etzion","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Tuvi","lastName":"Etzion","id":"37283334100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513662","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High dimensional error-correcting codes","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513662.pdf","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1182","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513662","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Redundancy","Multidimensional systems","Error correction","Shape","Linear code","Arm","Computer science","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-correcting codes","multidimensional codes","spheres"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513662","abstract":"In this paper we construct multidimensional codes with high dimension.

It is revealed that the numbers of feedback bits of both links should scale linearly with the transmit power at the relay, while the number of feedback bits from the relay to the BS needs to grow with the transmit power at the BS.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513696","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513696.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited feedback design for MIMO-relay assisted cellular networks with beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513696/","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback design for MIMO-relay assisted cellular networks with beamforming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434193","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513696/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback design for MIMO-relay assisted cellular networks with beamforming","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095441S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513701,"authors":[{"name":"Chinmay S.

To further aid the decoding, we will build our codes so that they consist of four generalized Alamouti blocks which allows decoding with reduced complexity. As far as we know, the resulting codes are the first having both reduced decoding complexity, and at the same time allowing one to give a proof of the NVD property.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513709","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513709.pdf","startPage":"1080","endPage":"1084","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast-decodable MIDO codes from crossed product algebras","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast-decodable MIDO codes from crossed product algebras","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513709/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434233","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513709/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast-decodable MIDO codes from crossed product algebras","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081005S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513712,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37546829100"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513712","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"abstract":"Space-time code designs based on a partial interference cancellation (PIC) group decoding has been recently proposed. The PIC group decoding complexity depends on the group size and is between the lowest linear receiver complexity and the highest ML decoding complexity. The symbol rate for a space-time code achieving full diversity with the PIC group decoding is also between those for the linear receivers and the ML decoding. In this paper, we propose a new decoding that is between the PIC group decoding and the ML decoding. With the proposed new decoding, we obtain a new design criterion for space-time codes to achieve full diversity, which is also between the one with the PIC group decoding and the one with the ML decoding. We then present some designs that satisfy the new criterion and in the meantime have higher symbol rates than that for the PIC group decoding.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513712.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1075","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On space-time code design with a conditional PIC group decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Decoding","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Block codes","Additive white noise","Signal to noise ratio","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","receivers","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time code design","PIC group decoding","partial interference cancellation group decoding","linear receiver","ML decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"On space-time code design with a conditional PIC group decoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513712/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434249","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On space-time code design with a conditional PIC group decoding","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091405S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513714,"authors":[{"name":"Pulkit Grover","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pulkit","lastName":"Grover","id":"37398027100"},{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513714","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":770,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5021},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Bandwidth","Coupling circuits","Additive white noise","Cochlear implants","Coils","Gaussian noise","Circuit noise","Fading","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","inductors","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Shannon","wireless information","power transfer","coupled-inductor circuit","frequency-selective channel","additive white Gaussian noise","Tesla"]}],"abstract":"The problem considered here is that of wireless information and power transfer across a noisy coupled-inductor circuit, which is a frequency-selective channel with additive white Gaussian noise.

In addition to the challenge of transmitting in a channel with time selective fading, energy harvesters provide a perpetual but unreliable energy source. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy allocation over a finite horizon, taking into account a time varying channel and energy source, so as to maximize the throughput. Two types of side information are assumed to be available: causal side information of the immediate past channel condition and harvested energy, and full side information. We obtain structural results for the optimal energy allocation, via the use of dynamic programming and convex optimization techniques. In particular, if unlimited energy can be stored in the battery with harvested energy, we prove the optimality of a water-filling energy allocation solution with multiple, non-decreasing water levels.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513719","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513719.pdf","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal energy allocation for wireless communications powered by energy harvesters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513719/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal energy allocation for wireless communications powered by energy harvesters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11445917","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513719/","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal energy allocation for wireless communications powered by energy harvesters","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059946S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513721,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshmi Prasad Natarajan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, IISc, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Lakshmi","lastName":"Prasad Natarajan","id":"37087249467"},{"name":"B.

Specifically, we focus on the interleaved concatenation of an outer channel code with error-correction capabilities and an inner marker code with synchronization capabilities. To limit the decoding latency, marker code-based synchronization is performed only once per received packet, i.e., iterations with the outer decoder are not allowed. We first numerically evaluate, through mutual information analyses, the ultimate rate achievable by this concatenated scheme when standard bit-level synchronization is performed. Then, we introduce a novel symbol-level synchronization algorithm that works on groups of consecutive bits, and show that it improves the achievable rate. Besides the achievable rate analyses, which allow us to optimize the marker code, we also report error-rate simulation results that confirm the superiority of symbol-level synchronization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513742/","accessionNumber":"11434339","displayDocTitle":"Marker code optimization and symbol-level synchronization for insertion/deletion channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Marker code optimization and symbol-level synchronization for insertion/deletion channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0001007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050645S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513746,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Kalai","affiliation":["Microsoft Research New England, UK"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Kalai","id":"37374782500"},{"name":"Michael Mitzenmacher","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mitzenmacher","id":"37266774000"},{"name":"Madhu Sudan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research New England, UK"],"firstName":"Madhu","lastName":"Sudan","id":"37326262800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513746","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Capacity planning","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","entropy","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary deletion channel capacity","deletion probability","standard binary entropy","asymptotic bounds"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513746","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513746.pdf","startPage":"997","endPage":"1001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tight asymptotic bounds for the deletion channel with small deletion probabilities","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the capacity C of the binary deletion channel for the limiting case where the deletion probability p goes to 0.

It is shown that a natural scheme that combines secret dirty-paper coding with Gaussian superposition coding achieves the secrecy capacity region. To prove this result, a channel-enhancement approach and an extremal entropy inequality of Weingarten et al. are used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential and common messages","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513775","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513775.pdf","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential and common messages","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5513775/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446044","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential and common messages","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091228S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513777,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Kosut","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Kosut","id":"37395775800"},{"name":"Lang Tong","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Lang","lastName":"Tong","id":"37276976900"},{"name":"David Tse","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tse","id":"37274371600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513777","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Throughput","Linear code","Vectors","Error correction","Wireless networks","Probability distribution","Technological innovation","Routing","Transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polytope codes","network coding","linear codes","code vectors","codewords","internal nodes","class planar networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Coding","Byzantine Attack","Network Error Correction","Nonlinear Codes"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polytope codes against adversaries in networks","abstract":"Network coding is studied when an unknown subset of nodes in the network is controlled by an adversary. To solve this problem, a new class of codes called Polytope Codes is introduced. Polytope Codes are linear codes operating over bounded polytopes in real vector fields. The polytope structure creates additional complexity, but it induces properties on marginal distributions of code vectors so that validities of codewords can be checked by internal nodes of the network. It is shown that a cut-set bound for a class planar networks can be achieved using Polytope Codes. It is also shown that this cut-set bound is not always tight, and a tighter bound is given for an example network.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513777","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513777.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513777","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2427","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Polytope codes against adversaries in networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446069","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polytope codes against adversaries in networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053399S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513781,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37533999600"},{"name":"Vincent K.

The traditional interference alignment on the signal space is infeasible for K > 3 and perfect channel state information (CSI) is required for all the alignment schemes in the literature, which is impractical in practice. Furthermore, the structured lattice, widely used in the practical communications, can create a structured interference space compared with random Gaussian symbols. However, the existing alignment schemes on the lattice codes either require infinite SNR or require symmetric interference channel coefficients. Furthermore, they all assume perfect CSI knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approximate lattice alignment scheme for general complex interference channels in the general SNR regimes as well as a two-stage decoding algorithm to decode the desired signal from the approximated structured interference space. We derive the achievable data rate based on the approximate lattice alignment scheme and formulated the precoder, equalizer as well as the interference quantization design as a mixed integer and continuous optimization problem. By exploiting specific problem structures and incorporating CSI errors in the design, we derive low complexity robust solutions. We show that the proposed scheme has significant gain compared with the existing baselines.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513781","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508195/5513230/05513781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5513230","startPage":"2298","endPage":"2302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust approximate lattice alignment design for K-pairs quasi-static MIMO interference channels with imperfect CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5513781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust approximate lattice alignment design for K-pairs quasi-static MIMO interference channels with imperfect CSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5513781/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11446073","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5513781/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust approximate lattice alignment design for K-pairs quasi-static MIMO interference channels with imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0002298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065315S","chronDate":"13-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508195","isNumber":"5513230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508195","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5513230","articleId":"5513781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5513782,"authors":[{"name":"Ersen Ekrem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ersen","lastName":"Ekrem","id":"37395816700"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7892-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7890-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7891-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"5513782","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Transmitters","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian MIMO broadcast channels","multiple-input multiple-output channel","common messages","confidential messages","capacity region","private messages"]}],"abstract":"We study the two-user Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel with common and confidential messages.

The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that possible delay failures due to process variations and/or voltage scaling are predicted in advance and addressed by employing an elastic clocking technique. The prediction mechanism exploits the dependence of delay of arithmetic units upon input data patterns and identifies specific inputs that activate the critical path. Under iso-yield conditions, the proposed design operates at a lower scaled down Vdd without any performance degradation, while it ensures a superlative yield under a design style employing nominal supply and transistor threshold voltage. Simulation results show power savings of upto 29%, energy per computation savings of upto 25.5% and yield enhancement of upto 11.1% compared to the conventional adders and multipliers implemented in the 70nm BPTM technology. We incorporated the proposed modules in the execution unit of a five stage DLX pipeline to measure performance using SPEC2000 benchmarks [9].

The salient contributions from this paper are: (1) Product-level variation analysis for multi-core processors must focus on throughput, rather than just FMAX, and (2) Multi-core processors are inherently more variation tolerant than single-core processors due to the larger impact of memory latency and bandwidth on overall throughput. To elucidate these two points, multi-core and single-core processors have a similar chip-level FMAX distribution (mean degradation of 9% and standard deviation of 5%) for multi-threaded applications. In contrast to single-core processors, memory latency and bandwidth constraints significantly limit the throughput dependency on FMAX in multi-core processors, thus reducing the throughput mean degradation and standard deviation by 50%. Since single-threaded applications running on a multi-core processor can execute on the fastest core, mean FMAX and throughput gains of 4% are achieved from the nominal design target.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513049/5514251/05514262.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '07)","doi":"10.1145/1283780.1283792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1283780.1283792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of die-to-die and within-die parameter variations on the throughput distribution of multi-core processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Multicore processing","Analytical models","Microprocessors","Clocks","Frequency","Delay","Bandwidth","Degradation","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["die-to-die parameter variation","within-die parameter variation","throughput distribution","multicore processors","statistical performance simulator","maximum clock frequency","compact analytical throughput model","salient contributions","product-level variation analysis","memory latency","multithreaded application","bandwidth constraints","throughput mean degradation","standard deviation","single-threaded application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FMAX distribution","multi-core","parameter fluctuations","parameter variations","throughput distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of die-to-die and within-die parameter variations on the throughput distribution of multi-core processors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514262/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"11463568","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of die-to-die and within-die parameter variations on the throughput distribution of multi-core processors","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"37090050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050807S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5513049","isNumber":"5514251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513049","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5514251","articleId":"5514262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5514265,"authors":[{"name":"Meeta Sharma Gupta","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University"],"firstName":"Meeta Sharma","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37398247500"},{"name":"Krishna K.

To retain the excellent energy efficiency while reducing performance loss, we propose to apply subthreshold and near-threshold techniques to chip multi-processors. We show that an architecture where several slower cores are clustered together with a shared faster L1 cache is optimal for energy efficiency, because processor cores and memory operate best at different supply and threshold voltages.

Our analysis show that, body-doping reduction combined with back-gate biasing is the most efficient FD/SOI device design for low-leakage and robust SRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514275/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514275/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11463579","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of Thin-BOX FD/SOI devices for low-power and stable SRAM in sub-50nm technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of Thin-BOX FD/SOI devices for low-power and stable SRAM in sub-50nm technologies","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"37090020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066398S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5513049","isNumber":"5514251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513049","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5514251","articleId":"5514275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5514278,"authors":[{"name":"Asha Balijepalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Asha","lastName":"Balijepalli","id":"37298465800"},{"name":"Saurabh Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37289905800"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277285000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-709-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5514278","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes","Transistors","Semiconductor device modeling","Space technology","Process design","Voltage","CMOS technology","Circuits","Robustness","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","nanoelectronics","Schottky barriers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact modeling","carbon nanotube transistor","process-design exploration","nanoscale integration","optimal process","physical modeling","Schottky-barrier CNT","MOS-type CNT","CMOS technology","SB-CNT","layout parasitics","power reduction","fixed energy consumption","size 22 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNT","modeling","optimum delay","process variability","schottky-barrier","surface potential"]}],"abstract":"Carbon nanotube transistor (CNT) is promising to be the technology of choice for nanoscale integration. In this work, we develop the first compact model of CNT, with the objective to explore the optimal process and design space for robust low-power applications. Based on the concept of the surface potential, the new model accurately predicts the characteristics of a CNT device under various process and design conditions, such as diameter, chirality, gate dielectrics, and bias voltages. With the physical modeling of the contact, this model covers both the Schottky-barrier CNT (SB-CNT) and MOS-type CNT. The proposed model does not require any iteration and thus, significantly enhances the simulation efficiency to support large-scale design research. Using this model, we benchmark the performance of a FO4 inverter with CNT and 22nm CMOS technology. The following key insights are extracted: (1) even with the SB-CNT and realistic layout parasitics, the circuit speed can be more than 10X that of 22nm CMOS; (2) The diameter range of 1-1.5nm exhibits the maximum tolerance to contact materials and process variations; (3) a CNT circuit allows better scaling of the supply voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dd</sub>\n) for power reduction.

Overall, the new model enables efficient design research with CNT, revealing tremendous opportunities for both high-speed and low-power applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact modeling of carbon nanotube transistor for early stage process-design exploration","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '07)","doi":"10.1145/1283780.1283783","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513049/5514251/05514278.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1283780.1283783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Compact modeling of carbon nanotube transistor for early stage process-design exploration","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514278/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"11463582","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact modeling of carbon nanotube transistor for early stage process-design exploration","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"37090002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06345S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5513049","isNumber":"5514251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513049","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5514251","articleId":"5514278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5514279,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Joshi","affiliation":["IBM T.

By leveraging spatial and temporal heat slacks, our schemes enable lowering of on-chip unit temperatures by changing the workload in a timely manner with Operating System(OS) and existing hardware support.","doi":"10.1145/1283780.1283826","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 international symposium on Low power electronics and design (ISLPED '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513049/5514251/05514320.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1283780.1283826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-aware task scheduling at the system software level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514320/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-aware task scheduling at the system software level","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514320/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"11463622","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-aware task scheduling at the system software level","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"37090213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059546S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5513049","isNumber":"5514251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513049","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5514251","articleId":"5514320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5514324,"authors":[{"name":"Sizhong Chen","affiliation":["Electrical Computer, and Systems Engineering-Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY"],"firstName":"Sizhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277600900"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical Computer, and Systems Engineering-Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-709-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5514324","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Detectors","Signal design","Wireless communication","MIMO","CMOS technology","Energy efficiency","Algorithm design and analysis","Throughput","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-output signal detection","wireless MIMO communication systems","multiple input multiple output systems","complexity reduction techniques","64-QAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","VLSI","detection","low power","spatial multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"Energy-efficient realization of soft-output signal detection is of great importance in emerging high-speed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.

We also propose a novel OFDMA-PON architecture that satisfies these requirements and is capable of exceeding 10 Gb/s upstream transmission over a single wavelength. It is first analytically shown that optical carrier suppression at the optical network units (ONUs) combined with coherent detection at the optical line terminal (OLT) successfully eliminates both in- and cross-polarization beating noise that would otherwise be generated at the OLT and would fundamentally limit upstream transmission performance. A centralized light source OFDM-based PON architecture with source-free ONUs and OLTside coherent detection is then presented and experimentally verified to achieve 20 Gb/s/\u03bb transmission over a class B+ optical distribution network (20 km SSMF with an additional 1:32 optical split.) By thus providing very high-speed, flexible, colorless upstream transmission, the proposed architecture is an attractive candidate for next-generation PON systems capable of cost-efficiently delivering heterogeneous services.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5514386/05514391.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access PON (OFDMA-PON) for colorless upstream transmission beyond 10 Gb/s","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Passive optical networks","Optical network units","High speed optical techniques","Optical fiber networks","Optical noise","Performance analysis","Optical detectors","Noise generators","Light sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiple access PON","colorless upstream transmission","upstream architectures","optical carrier suppression","optical network units","optical line terminal","in-polarization beating noise","cross-polarization beating noise","optical distribution network","heterogeneous services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), passive optical networks (PON), Source-free, carrier suppression, multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access PON (OFDMA-PON) for colorless upstream transmission beyond 10 Gb/s","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5514391/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11445176","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access PON (OFDMA-PON) for colorless upstream transmission beyond 10 Gb/s","sourcePdf":"781jsac0610cvijetic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068394S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5514386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5514386","articleId":"5514391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5514392,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-min Lin","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5514386/5514392/5514392-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Min Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing-Hua University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2003.

We analytically and experimentally study the receiver sensitivity to OFDMA signals and the radio frequency (RF) signal's performance. By corroborating simulation results with experimental results, we discuss the determination of crucial system parameters, such as the optimal broadband-to-radio power ratio, and the exploitation of a notch filter for removing RF interference. Experimental results show that the integrated 10 Gb/s OFDMA and three 20 MHz RF signals are successfully transported both downstream and upstream over a 20 km single-mode-fiber PON. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that QPSK-encoded WiMAX format RF signals are transmitted/relayed upstream with E-O-E conversion at each optical network unit (ONU), and received error-free at the optical line terminal after cascading 32 ONU's.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5514386/05514392.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Next-generation OFDMA-based passive optical network architecture supporting radio-over-fiber","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","Passive optical networks","Optical network units","Broadband antennas","Optical receivers","RF signals","Radio frequency","Frequency conversion","Central office","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optical modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next-generation OFDMA","passive optical network architecture","radio-over-fiber","next-generation orthogonal frequency division multiple access","local broadband OFDMA data","multiple remote antennas","WDM lasers","receiver sensitivity","radio frequency signal","optimal broadband-to-radio power ratio","notch filter","single-mode-fiber PON","QPSK-encoded WiMAX","optical network unit","optical line terminal","ROFPON","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","frequency 20 MHz","distance 20 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA), passive optical network (PON), radio over fiber (RoF), radio frequency (RF), optical fiber communication, optical modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Next-generation OFDMA-based passive optical network architecture supporting radio-over-fiber","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5514392/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11445177","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Next-generation OFDMA-based passive optical network architecture supporting radio-over-fiber","sourcePdf":"791jsac0610lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5514386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5514386","articleId":"5514392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5514393,"authors":[{"name":"C.

OFDM signal has high spectral efficiency, high tolerance to the fiber chromatic dispersion and the high flexibility on both multiple services provisioning and dynamic bandwidth allocation. In this paper we study the use of OFDM signals for optical access networks, including carrier distributed PON, heterogeneous optical wired/wireless network and a 100 Gb/s OFDM-PON. We first quantify the performance of the OFDM signal when subjected to the noise produced by two different Rayleigh backscattering (RB) components that are present in the carrier-distributed PON. Then, based on these results, we also study the possibility of using OFDM for signal remodulation in a long-reach (LR)-PON. We propose carrier-distributed OFDM PONs using a dual-feeder fiber architecture and wavelength-shifting to mitigate the RB noise. Afterwards, we propose heterogeneous optical wired/wireless access networks, combining 10 Gb/s PON and 10 Gb/s OFDM radio-over-fiber (ROF) network.

All schemes are evaluated and compared using computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5514386/05514397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514386","startPage":"838","endPage":"848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the efficiency of online upstream scheduling and wavelength assignment in hybrid WDM/TDMA EPON networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving the efficiency of online upstream scheduling and wavelength assignment in hybrid WDM/TDMA EPON networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11445172","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5514397/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the efficiency of online upstream scheduling and wavelength assignment in hybrid WDM/TDMA EPON networks","sourcePdf":"838jsac0610kanonakis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061996S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5514386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5514386","articleId":"5514397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5514406,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These are mainly due to the large number of new vulnerabilities and architectural weaknesses introduced by the extensive use of ICT and networking technologies into such complex systems. The analysis of the effects of these new threats is a mandatory activity to ensure the security of critical installation relying on SCADA systems. In this paper, after describing an experimental platform developed for studying the effects of ICT attacks against SCADA systems, we present some attack scenarios successfully exploited in this experimental platform, taking as reference the SCADA system of a typical Turbo-Gas Power Plant. Moreover we present a brief overview of the possible countermeasures for enhancing the security of SCADA systems.","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2010.5514494","publicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Human System Interaction","startPage":"679","endPage":"686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2010.5514494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514476","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508866/5514476/05514494.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Human System Interaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","SCADA systems","Power system security","Information security","Process control","Terrorism","System testing","Protocols","Power system protection","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined cycle power stations","power engineering computing","power generation protection","SCADA systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCADA vulnerabilities","SCADA countermeasures","turbo-gas power plant","SCADA systems","security threats","ICT attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scada Systems","ICT Security","Experimental Platforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An experimental platform for assessing SCADA vulnerabilities and countermeasures in power plants","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514494/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514494/","accessionNumber":"11445833","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental platform for assessing SCADA vulnerabilities and countermeasures in power plants","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"p679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068218S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508866","isNumber":"5514476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508866","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5514476","articleId":"5514494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5514529,"authors":[{"name":"Janusz Kolbusz","affiliation":["Department of Distributed Systems, University of Information Technology and Management, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Kolbusz","id":"37543168900"},{"name":"Janusz Korniak","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Information Technology and Management, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Korniak","id":"37543169000"},{"name":"Stanislaw Paszczynski","affiliation":["Department of Distributed Systems, University of Information Technology and Management, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Paszczynski","id":"37543170700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7560-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7561-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"5514529","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Communication system traffic control","Character generation","Computer networks","Application software","Information technology","Information management","Technology management","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic anomalies","self similar traffic model","anomaly detection method","multilayer on-off model","traffic source","traffic flow","traffic generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network traffic model","self-similarity","network anomaly"]}],"abstract":"The self-similarity becomes one of the method of anomaly detection.

Being different from traditional computation in second order algorithms, the proposed method simplifies Hessian matrix computation, by removing Jacobian matrix computation and storage. Matrix multiplications are replaced by vector operations. The proposed computation not only makes the training process faster, but also reduces the memory cost significantly. Based upon the improvement, second order algorithms can be applied for application with unlimited number of patterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Human System Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508866/5514476/05514571.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"181","publicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Human System Interaction","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2010.5514571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2010.5514571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and efficient and training of neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Neurons","Jacobian matrices","Pattern matching","USA Councils","Costs","Computer networks","Signal processing","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hessian matrices","Jacobian matrices","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix multiplication","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network training","Hessian matrix computation","Jacobian matrix computation","Jacobian matrix storage","matrix multiplications","Levenberg Marquardt algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network training","Levenberg Marquardt algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast and efficient and training of neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514571/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11445802","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and efficient and training of neural networks","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"p175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105096S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508866","isNumber":"5514476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508866","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5514476","articleId":"5514571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5514573,"authors":[{"name":"Dann Barnes","affiliation":["University of Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Dann","lastName":"Barnes","id":"37545172700"},{"name":"Milos Manic","affiliation":["University of Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Manic","id":"37277736800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7560-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7561-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"5514573","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Personal digital assistants","Application software","Military computing","Clustering algorithms","Marketing and sales","Smart phones","Unsupervised learning","Multidimensional systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","feature extraction","language translation","natural language processing","neural nets","unsupervised learning","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STRICR-FB","size translation rotation invariant character recognition method","feature vector construction","Kohonen winner take all","unsupervised learning","multidimensional space vectors","Hiragana characters","neural network","Matlab","image processing toolbox","MS Mincho font set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Character recognition","feature extraction","neural networks","pattern recognition"]}],"abstract":"Character recognition is an active field of research. Applications include point of sale systems, tablet computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones, and military applications. Recognizing Asian characters has been pursued since 1984, and difficulties exist in Japanese due to the complexity and numbers of Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana characters. It is further complicated by differences in size, translation, and rotation. This paper contributes an original approach to constructing feature vectors. The presented Size-Translation-Rotation-Invariant Character Recognition and Feature vector Based STRICR-FB algorithm is based on the Kohonen Winner Take All (WTA) type of unsupervised learning. The algorithm clusters a multidimensional space vectors uniquely derived from the Hiragana characters. The STRICR-FB methodology creates a neural network by design and not by training. This alleviates typical training problems like instability and no convergence. Furthermore, an upper bound degree of closeness is determined by the distance between the two closest unique feature vectors. The STRICR-FB algorithm was implemented in Matlab and uses the Image Processing Toolbox to process the images. The algorithm was tested on the MS Mincho font set. It demonstrated a recognition rate of 90% independent of size, translation, and rotation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STRICR-FB, a novel Size-Translation-Rotation-Invariant Character Recognition method","publicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Human System Interaction","doi":"10.1109/HSI.2010.5514573","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd International Conference on Human System Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508866/5514476/05514573.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HSI.2010.5514573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"STRICR-FB, a novel Size-Translation-Rotation-Invariant Character Recognition method","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514573/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11445804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STRICR-FB, a novel Size-Translation-Rotation-Invariant Character Recognition method","confLoc":"Rzeszow, Poland","sourcePdf":"p163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053473S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508866","isNumber":"5514476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508866","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5514476","articleId":"5514573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5514591,"authors":[{"name":"Bohdan Kozarzewski","affiliation":["University of Information Technology and Management, Rzeszow, Poland"],"firstName":"Bohdan","lastName":"Kozarzewski","id":"37542657600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7560-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7561-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-2246"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2254"}],"articleNumber":"5514591","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514591","abstract":"Neural network based system is proposed as a tool supporting time series forecasting.

Time domain features of each beat in the ECG signal such as T wave amplitude, Q wave and ST level deviation, which are indicative of MI, are extracted. For localization, lead-wise principal components analysis (PCA) is done on the data extracted from ST-T region and Q wave region of each beat. The resulting principal components are used as features for localization of seven types of myocardial infarction. For detection, it is found that the sensitivity and specificity of BPNN for beat classification is 97.5 % and 99.1% respectively. For localization, PCA based features using back propagation neural network classifier resulted in a beat classification accuracy of 93.7%. The proposed method due to its simplicity and high accuracy over the PTB database can be very helpful in correct diagnosis of MI in a practical scenario.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2010.5514664","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513048/5514659/05514664.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2010.5514664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection and Localization of Myocardial Infarction Using Back Propagation Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection and Localization of Myocardial Infarction Using Back Propagation Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11495103","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5514664/","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection and Localization of Myocardial Infarction Using Back Propagation Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"03-05-001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05093S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513048","isNumber":"5514659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513048","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5514659","articleId":"5514664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5514691,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

AMO and multilevel LINC (ML-LINC) transmitters improve their efficiency over LINC by switching the supplies of the power amplifiers (PAs) among a discrete set of voltages. This allows them to minimize the occurrence of large outphasing angles. However, it is also possible to generate a discrete set of amplitudes by varying the duty cycle of the waveform that drives the PAs. The chief advantage of this discrete pulse width modulation (DPWM) is hardware simplicity, as it eliminates the need for a fast, low-loss switching network and a selection of power supply voltages. We demonstrate this concept with a 48-MHz, 20-W peak output power AMO transmitter using a four-level DPWM. At peak output power, the measured power-added efficiency is 77.7%. For a 16-QAM signal with a 6.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio, the AMO prototype improves the average efficiency from 17.1% to 36.5% compared to the standard LINC system.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514707","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05514707.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5514707","startPage":"264","endPage":"267","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5514707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric multilevel outphasing transmitter using class-E PAs with discrete pulse width modulation","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5514707/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11452985","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric multilevel outphasing transmitter using class-E PAs with discrete pulse width modulation","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066295S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5514707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5514717,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

For the entities like, protein, gene and disease, we determine whether the statement refers to biomarker relationship (i.e., assertion classification). Finally, we identify the biomarker relationship among the bio-medical entities (i.e., semantic relationship classification). The system, Biomarker Information Extraction Tool (BIET) implements Machine Learning-based biomarker extraction using support vector machines (SVM). The system is trained and tested on a corpus of oncology related PubMed/MEDLINE literatures hand-annotated with biomarker information. We investigate the effectiveness of different features for this task and examine the amount of training data needed to learn the biomarker relationship with the entities. Our system achieved an average F-score of 86% for the task of biomarker information extraction comparing to the human annotated dataset (i.e. gold standard) scores.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2010.5514717","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513048/5514659/05514717.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2010.5514717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Biomarker Information Applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514717/","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Biomarker Information Applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11510130","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514717/","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Biomarker Information Applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"01-01-006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072506S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513048","isNumber":"5514659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513048","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5514659","articleId":"5514717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5514723,"authors":[{"name":"Eli Reese","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Reese","id":"37295584200"},{"name":"Donald Allen","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Allen","id":"37530676900"},{"name":"Cathy Lee","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Cathy","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280406400"},{"name":"Tuong Nguyen","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tuong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38490905500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5514723","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","MMICs","Gallium nitride","Silicon carbide","Distributed amplifiers","Frequency","Circuit topology","Thermal conductivity","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","MMIC power amplifiers","network topology","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband power amplifier MMIC","wideband circuit topologies","frequency 2 GHz to 18 GHz","power 11 W","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["broadband power amplifiers","MMIC power amplifiers","Gallium Nitride","Silicon Carbide"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514723","abstract":"The application of GaN on SiC technology to wideband power amplifier MMICs is explored.

The proposed optimized FLNN is tested through several experiments, including real-time identification of some nonlinear dynamic systems. Finally, we develop a comparison between the results with the previous counterpart optimized FLNN based LMS, BP, and some evolutionary (GA, PSO, CLPSO) training algorithms.

This is an improved version of previously reported InGaP/GaAs HBT capable of operating with supply voltages up to 32 V. Generation 2 HVHBT technology maintains the same high level of efficiency and compatibility with Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) techniques but has higher gain, higher power density and greater tolerance to load mismatch and input overdrive. Two discrete power transistors, 120 W and 220 W, were developed using Generation 2 HVHBT technology for 2.1 GHz WCDMA/LTE applications. Both 2x120 W and 2x220 W Doherty amplifiers were designed to demonstrate gain approaching 14 dB and efficiency in excess of 55% at 6 dB operating back-off.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Voltage","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Base stations","High power amplifiers","Driver circuits","Gallium arsenide","Power transistors","Multiaccess communication","Gain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5514775","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05514775.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5514775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation 2 High Voltage Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor technology for high efficiency base station power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generation 2 High Voltage Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor technology for high efficiency base station power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514775/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation 2 High Voltage Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor technology for high efficiency base station power amplifiers","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TH4D4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024285S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5514775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5514778,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlan Xia","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chunlan","lastName":"Xia","id":"37534165900"},{"name":"Anyuan Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Anyuan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37528554500"},{"name":"Dong C.

Experiments show that our GPU implementation can achieve a frame rate about 48 fps from RF signals of 206 \u00d7 2172 samples to an image with a size of 256 \u00d7 512.

The proposed scheme is composed of two parts: a multi-body model of the semi-active suspension system and a genetic algorithm-based fuzzy logic controller. With the fast development of computers, multi-body model and multi-body systems dynamics are applied to a broad variety of engineering problems. In this work, ADAMS software is utilized to complete the multi-body model of a full car semi-active suspension system. In order to control the suspension system efficiently, a fuzzy logic controller is developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The kernel of the fuzzy logic controller is a set of linguistic control rules. The conventional fuzzy control rules are established by the knowledge and experience of expertise or skilled operator. In other words, the rules are dependent on the knowledge and the experience of expertise, and may not be optimal. So, in this paper, a fuzzy logic controller is developed to generate the rule table automatically based on the improved genetic algorithm. To verify the performance of the genetic algorithm-based controller, simulations were simulated with random road profile at two different speeds, 25m/sec and 35m/sec, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control system in comparison with the passive suspension response. It was shown that this developed fuzzy logic controller based on genetic algorithm enhances the performance of the full car suspension system significantly. This control system is suitable for the multi-body model and can be extended to other applications of the mechanical systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5514808","startPage":"1478","endPage":"1483","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5514808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05514808.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of fuzzy logic controller for multi-body model of semi-active suspension based on genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514808/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of fuzzy logic controller for multi-body model of semi-active suspension based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514808/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11434061","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of fuzzy logic controller for multi-body model of semi-active suspension based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp279P0667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119622S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5514808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5514825,"authors":[{"name":"Fernanda Hembecker","affiliation":["Bioinformatics Laboratory, Federal University of Technology of Paran\u00e1 (UTFPR), Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernanda","lastName":"Hembecker","id":"38254220700"},{"name":"Heitor Silverio Lopes","affiliation":["Bioinformatics Laboratory, Federal University of Technology of Paran\u00e1 (UTFPR), Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Heitor Silverio","lastName":"Lopes","id":"37285825200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4712-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4713-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"CD","value":"2151-7614"}],"articleNumber":"5514825","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"The protein folding problem is a central issue in Bioinformatics.

Twenty-seven representative office chairs are derived from 100 collected as the experimental samples by using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Moreover, a morphological analysis is applied to extract 7 product form elements from these sample office chairs. The concept of Kansei Engineering and a best-performing NN model are chosen to examine the complex relationship between 7 design elements and 15 consumers' perceptions of EpV attributes which are identified and categorized into aesthetic, functional, and environmental dimensions. With the NN model, an office chair design database is built consisting of 960 different combinations of design elements, together with their associated EpV attributes. The application of the design database provides product designers with the best combination of product form elements for examining the aesthetic, functional, and environmental-friendly attributes to an office chair design, and facilitating the eco-product form deign process.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5514832","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05514832.pdf","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1450","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5514832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to eco-product form design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to eco-product form design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11434007","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5514832/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to eco-product form design","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp273P0640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082774S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5514832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5514863,"authors":[{"name":"Karsten Kuhlmann","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Kuhlmann","id":"37319918700"},{"name":"Arne F.

The modulated signal is fixed into several time divisions and then be integrated and encoded to a set of parallel control signal for multilevel converter. Furthermore, the pulse density adjustment circuit dynamically adjusts the power delivery according to over-current detection. Under the protection scheme, the amplifier is able to completely eliminate audio holes and continue working well without sacrificing total-harmonic-distortion (THD) and power efficiency. The experiment results show that the losses of THD and power efficiency are within 10dB and 2% which significantly improves audio holes effect.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Pulse amplifiers","Power system protection","Power amplifiers","Pulse width modulation converters","Power transistors","Space vector pulse width modulation","Circuits","Voltage","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","amplifiers","harmonic distortion","overcurrent protection","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM-based multilevel class-D amplifier","integrated overcurrent protection system","pulsewidth modulation","multilevel converter","time division adder","parallel control signal","pulse density adjustment circuit","overcurrent detection","total harmonic distortion","audio hole effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["over-current protection system","class-D amplifier","PWM","multilevel converter","audio holes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5514872","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05514872.pdf","startPage":"1394","endPage":"1398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5514872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM-based multilevel class-D amplifier with integrated over-current protection system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5514872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PWM-based multilevel class-D amplifier with integrated over-current protection system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514872/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5514872/","accessionNumber":"11433869","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM-based multilevel class-D amplifier with integrated over-current protection system","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp263P0324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049728S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5514872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5514908,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Cruz","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciies, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Cruz","id":"37391871900"},{"name":"Nuno Borges Carvalho","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciies, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno Borges","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"37264877100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5514908","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"abstract":"This paper presents a comprehensive behavioral model of a band-pass sampling receiver working throughout its input bandwidth.

Starting with a feedback loop principle model of a PA, an appropriate structure is deduced. This structure was then optimized to form a 2HLANN based model capable of predicting the nonlinear behavior and the memory effects of PAs. The validation of the proposed model in mimicking the behavior of a DUT is carried out in terms of its accuracy in predicting the output spectrum, dynamic AM/AM and AM/PM and the NMSE. In addition, the 2HLANN model was used to linearize two 250 Watt PEP Doherty PAs (DPAs) driven with 20 MHz bandwidth signals. The linearization of these DPAs using the 2HLANN enabled attaining an output power of 46.8 dBm and an average efficiency of up to 47.5% coupled with an ACPR higher than 50 dBc. When compared to some published behavioral and DPD schemes, the 2HLANN model demonstrated an excellent modeling accuracy and linearization capability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5514964/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Behavioral modeling and digital predistortion of power amplifiers with memory using two hidden layers artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavioral modeling and digital predistortion of power amplifiers with memory using two hidden layers artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WE2F1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038292S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5514964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5514984,"authors":[{"name":"E.

As for the step, the microstrip is modeled by an equivalent transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguide. An equation relating the optimum microstrip width to the SIW width is derived using a curve fitting technique. It is shown that when the step is properly sized, it provides a return loss superior to 20 dB. Three design examples are presented using different substrate permittivity and frequency bands between 18 GHz and 75 GHz. An experimental verification is also presented. The presented technique allows to design transitions covering the complete single-mode SIW bandwidth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5515088","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05515088.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5515088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WE3A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031653S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5515088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5515104,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00e9mi Corbi\u00e8re","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","Thales Systemes A\u00e9roport\u00e9s, Elancourt, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Corbi\u00e8re","id":"38243161200"},{"name":"Bruno Louis","affiliation":["Thales Systemes A\u00e9roport\u00e9s, Elancourt, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Louis","id":"37542279700"},{"name":"Jean-Guy Tartarin","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Guy","lastName":"Tartarin","id":"37364533900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5515104","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"abstract":"In this paper, a new structure based on variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) in SiGe technology with high linearity (Pin1dB > 8 dBm) and high dynamic range (> 30 dB) under 3.3 V is presented.

This paper proposes a new computer vision system for automatic steel surface inspection. The system analyzes the images sequentially acquired from steel bar to detect different kinds of defects on the steel surface. Several image processing strategies are used to detect and outline the defects. The detected defects are then classified into different defect types by using a hierarchical neural network classifier. Some manual detection results by field experts are used to verify the correctness of the proposed detection. In defect classification, the results show that the relevance vector machine (RVM) has better accuracy than the back propagation neural network (BPN). The proposed algorithm was found capable of detecting defects on steel surface rapidly and precisely.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computer vision system for automatic steel surface inspection","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515197","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05515197.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A computer vision system for automatic steel surface inspection","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5515197/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11433965","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computer vision system for automatic steel surface inspection","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp314P0654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0493S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5515197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5515203,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawei Luo","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37537081200"},{"name":"Jiachen Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jiachen","lastName":"Guo","id":"37535595300"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37538196200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4712-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4713-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7622"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-7614"},{"format":"CD","value":"2151-7614"}],"articleNumber":"5515203","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sequences","Biology computing","Chemicals","Application software","DNA computing","Computer graphics","Data mining","Performance analysis","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","biological techniques","DNA","genetic algorithms","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphical representation","similarity-dissimilarity analysis","DNA sequences","graphic representation","characteristic matrix","JZ-curve","gene sequences","biological information"]}],"abstract":"The JZ-curve, a new graphical expression of the gene sequence, is introduced.

Glaucoma can be diagnosed through measurement of neuro-retinal optic cup-to-disc ratio (CDR). Correctly determining the optic disc region of interest (ROI) will produce a smaller initial image which takes much lesser time taken to process compared to the entire image. The earlier ROI localization in the ARGALI system used a grid based method. The new algorithm adds a preprocessing step before analyzing the image. This step significantly improves the performance of the ROI detection. A batch of 1564 retinal images from the Singapore Eye Research Centre was used to compare the performance of the two methods. From the results, the earlier and new algorithm detects the ROI correctly for 88% and 96% of the images respectively. The results indicate potential applicability of the method for automated and objective mass screening for early detection of glaucoma.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05515221.pdf","startPage":"1686","endPage":"1689","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optic disc region of interest localization in fundus image for Glaucoma detection in ARGALI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Blindness","Head","Degenerative diseases","Image analysis","Cameras","Computer vision","Algorithm design and analysis","Tomography","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","medical image processing","neurophysiology","vision defects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optic disc region of interest localization","fundus image","glaucoma detection","automatic cup-to-disc ratio measurement system","permanent blindness","neuro-retinal optic cup-to-disc ratio","ARGALI system","grid based method","preprocessing step","1564 retinal images","objective mass screening"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["glaucoma","retinal fundus image","region of interest"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optic disc region of interest localization in fundus image for Glaucoma detection in ARGALI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5515221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11448244","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optic disc region of interest localization in fundus image for Glaucoma detection in ARGALI","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp318P0399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083824S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5515221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5515248,"authors":[{"name":"Vesna Radisic","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vesna","lastName":"Radisic","id":"37296529400"},{"name":"Kevin M.K.H.

In most of the application fields, the coprocessor should be small-area, low-power, low-cost and high-availability, which can not only provide various candidate encryption algorithms, but also with acceptable performance according to the application requirement. In the view of this context, we propose a kind of new system architecture for security coprocessor based on reconfiguration, scalability and tightly coupled structure ideas, which can achieve various encryption operations with easy upgrade and reconfiguration. On the other hand, the security coprocessor can also mitigate the contention of data bus and raise the transfer data rate through the optimized internal data bus network. The new architecture can greatly reduce the area and power consumption of the security coprocessor, and improve the adaptability, flexibility and security of the whole system. At the end of this paper, a security coprocessor is implemented in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS technology to verify the ideas of the paper, where different encryption algorithms are realized through changing the content of instruction set registers. The core area of the improved security module is 56 K gates at 100 MHz with an average power of 83 mW. Comparing with traditional work, we achieve equal security function with lower power, smaller size and easier reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515381","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05515381.pdf","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable and scalable architecture for security coprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515381/","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable and scalable architecture for security coprocessor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11433788","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5515381/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable and scalable architecture for security coprocessor","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp345P0622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048252S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5515381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5515382,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ma","affiliation":["School of automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ma","id":"37536697400"},{"name":"Kejie Huang","affiliation":["School of automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kejie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086894983"},{"name":"Jianqiang Yan","affiliation":["School of automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086893119"},{"name":"Kaihua Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China","Oracle Corporation, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaihua","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086895152"},{"name":"L.

The new algorithms take full advantage of some known channel information (for example, the length of channel impulse response L which can be estimated easily and explicitly by systems) to reduce computational complexity, the impact of noise and interference. Special time-domain training sequences were designed to accomplish these algorithms in simple and efficient ways. Firstly, the paper derived a precise mathematical model and the coarse CFO acquisition in which the influence of unknown multipath Channel Impulse Response (CIR) can be removed. Then mathematics seal solution Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection for coarse CFO is formulated instead of EM iteration detection. Secondly, time-domain CIR estimation algorithm is formulated with the advantage of noise and residual CFO reduction. Moreover, the new CIR estimator adopts matrix dimension reduction algorithm to reduce computational complexity. Thirdly, to improve the CFO acquisition performance, improved Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed as fine CFO acquisition.

Two cases are discussed, the high demanding applications and the constrained switching frequency applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515585","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05515585.pdf","startPage":"2328","endPage":"2338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5515585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design methodology and FPGA-based controllers for Power Electronics and drive applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design methodology and FPGA-based controllers for Power Electronics and drive applications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5515585/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11434002","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design methodology and FPGA-based controllers for Power Electronics and drive applications","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp439DIL1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157858S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5515585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5515670,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Wen Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Wen Hung","id":"37087860951"},{"name":"Cheng-Tsung Lin","affiliation":["DynaPack Company Limited, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Tsung Lin","id":"37087984702"},{"name":"Jhih-Han Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jhih-Han Chen","id":"37087858038"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5045-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5046-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5515670","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pi control","Brushless DC motors","Torque","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sensor systems","Feedback","Timing","DC motors","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","DC motor drives","feedback","feedforward","machine control","PI control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable sampling PI control","variable sampling torque compensation","BLDC motors drives","brushless DC motor","feedback timing","torque load estimator","feedforward compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["variable sampling","torque compensation","BLDC motor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515670","abstract":"This paper discusses the variable sampling phenomenon what occurs in many system, such as brushless DC motor with Hall sensors.

A novel circuit breaker topology is proposed in this paper, which is improved by using the current-commutation of hybrid circuit breakers for reference. By making use of soft-switching and current-commutation forced by resonance, the new topology can not only successfully realize the soft turn-on and fast turn-off but also can be applied in the situation of higher voltage level. The topology is presented and mathematical model is built by mode analysis. Finally, the normal turn-on and turn-off experiment was taken on a prototype.

Since the historic flight of Cosmos 669 in 1974, and the first THz telescope with cryo-cooled detectors operated on board Salyut 6 in 1978, satellite instruments have performed both direct detection and heterodyne spectroscopy measurements in the interstellar medium, in external galaxies, in the atmospheres of planets and comets and in the Earth's stratosphere. Seven-teen orbital instruments containing THz sensors or sources have either completed their mission objectives or are currently operational. They originate in Russia, Japan, Europe and the US and cover applications in astrophysics and cosmology; planetary and small solar system body science; and pollution, ozone and climate monitoring on the Earth. At least a dozen serious future mission proposals are under consideration, including new areas of meteorology, terrestrial planet finding and planetary radar spectroscopy. It is truly a golden age for THz space science and applications. This talk will review past, present and future space instruments carrying infrared, millimeter wave and terahertz components and their science objectives.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Terrestrial atmosphere","Atmospheric measurements","Extraterrestrial measurements","Pollution measurement","Spectroscopy","Planets","Submillimeter wave measurements","Telescopes","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace instrumentation","artificial satellites","submillimetre wave detectors","terahertz spectroscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral measurements","terahertz instruments","Earth atmosphere","AD 1974","Cosmos 669","terahertz telescope","cryo-cooled detectors","Salyut 6","AD 1978","heterodyne spectroscopy measurements","interstellar medium","terahertz sensors","meteorology","terrestrial planet finding","planetary radar spectroscopy","infrared space instruments","millimeter-Wave space instruments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5515761","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05515761.pdf","startPage":"816","endPage":"819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5515761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THz for space: The golden age","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"THz for space: The golden age","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515761/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5515761/","accessionNumber":"11452785","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THz for space: The golden age","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058984S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5515761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5515797,"authors":[{"name":"Guogong Wang","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Guogong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278826700"},{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37538096200"},{"name":"Margaret Szymanowski","affiliation":["RF Division, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Margaret","lastName":"Szymanowski","id":"37545431700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5515797","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":593},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Base stations","Power transistors","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Multiaccess communication","Plastic packaging","Mutual coupling","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","MOS integrated circuits","power amplifiers","power transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doherty amplifier","TD-SCDMA base station application","single packaged dual-path integrated LDMOS power transistor","Doherty power amplifier","dual path two-stage IC","LDMOS technology","freescale HV7IC technology","frequency 1.88 GHz to 1.92 GHz","frequency 2.01 GHz to 2.025 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","LDMOS","Doherty amplifier","TD-SCDMA"]}],"abstract":"A Doherty power amplifier designed for TDSCDMA base station applications using a dual path two-stage IC with LDMOS technology has been demonstrated with excellent performance.

EEG signals were recorded at University of California, Irvine (UCI) from 7 volunteer subjects imagining two syllables, /ba/ and /ku/, without speaking or performing any overt actions. Our goal is to classify these imagined syllables and based on the resulting accuracy assess the feasibility of this task. In this research, the EEG data are preprocessed to reduce the effects of artifacts and noise, and autoregressive (AR) coefficients are extracted as features for imagined syllable classification using a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Initial results suggest that it is possible to identify imagined speech.","doi":"10.1109/ICBBE.2010.5515807","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5513048/5514659/05515807.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBBE.2010.5515807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imagined Speech Classification with EEG Signals for Silent Communication: A Preliminary Investigation into Synthetic Telepathy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Electroencephalography","Electrodes","Data mining","Muscles","Decoding","Electric variables measurement","Feature extraction","Noise reduction","Brain computer interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","brain-computer interfaces","decoding","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","signal classification","speech coding","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech classification","EEG signals","synthetic telepathy","electroencephalography","imagined speech","decoding","electrical brain waves","autoregressive coefficients","feature extraction","k-nearest neighbor classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Imagined Speech Classification with EEG Signals for Silent Communication: A Preliminary Investigation into Synthetic Telepathy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5515807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11495389","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imagined Speech Classification with EEG Signals for Silent Communication: A Preliminary Investigation into Synthetic Telepathy","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"03-04-046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044685S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513048","isNumber":"5514659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513048","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5514659","articleId":"5515807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5515822,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Rongi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Rongi","id":"37542362700"},{"name":"A.

by integrating an absorptive single-pole four-throw (SP4T) switch together with a 4\u00d74 Butler matrix using 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS process. The fabricated absorptive SP4T switch shows a measured insertion loss of 4.5 dB at 60 GHz and isolation higher than 31 dB from 57 to 63 GHz. The return losses of the deactivated output ports also maintain better than 14 dB due to the absorptive configuration. The entire insertion loss of the integrated beam former IC was around 7.5 dB at 60 GHz, among which 3 dB is attributed to Butler matrix. The overall phase error was within \u00b112%. The calculated array factor from the measured S-parameters shows that the beam-forming network generates four beams at \u00b114\u00b0, \u00b154\u00b0.

of periodic structures based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. In the periodic structures of interest, the unit cell is a circularly-shaped SIW section, which can be extended to any shape. In the beginning, the propagation constants of both even and odd modes of the SIW periodic structures are accurately extracted with the help of a numerical thru-line (TL) calibration technique, which utilizes two periodic structure sections having different cell numbers as calibration standards. Then, two design examples are showcased to validate the analysis results. The first example is a planar crossover structure using the circularly-shaped SIW coupling section. The other is a bandpass filter that is designed by making use of the stopband characteristics of the proposed SIW periodic structures. Good agreement is observed between simulation and measurement for both examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5515909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11452814","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5515909/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Accurate analysis of finite periodic substrate integrated waveguide structures and its applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate analysis of finite periodic substrate integrated waveguide structures and its applications","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046839S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5515909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5515989,"authors":[{"name":"Zach Griffith","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific Company (TSC), Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zach","lastName":"Griffith","id":"37270329500"},{"name":"Wonill Ha","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific Company (TSC), Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wonill","lastName":"Ha","id":"37284426400"},{"name":"Peter Chen","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific Company (TSC), Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280842700"},{"name":"Dae-Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific Company (TSC), Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dae-Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279314000"},{"name":"Bobby Brar","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific Company (TSC), Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bobby","lastName":"Brar","id":"37305004500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5515989","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indium phosphide","mHEMTs","Transistors","Microstrip","Thin film circuits","MMICs","Substrates","MIMICs","Frequency","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","microstrip components","MMIC amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-stage amplifier","mHEMT","thin-film microstrip environment","millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuit amplifier","high electron mobility transistor","frequency 206 GHz to 294 GHz","size 35 nm","InP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["InP metamorphic high electron mobility transistor (InP mHEMT)","E-mode transistor","millimeter Wave","MMIC","low-loss dielectric layer","multiple interconnect layers","thin-film microstrip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5515989","abstract":"We present a compact, 3-stage millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifier with an operating frequency of 206-294 GHz, formed by common-source configured 35 nm L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</sub>\n InP mHEMTs and a multi-layer thin-film microstrip (TFM) wiring environment.

The amplifier has been designed in a commercially available 0.35\u03bcm CMOS process. Powered by 1.5V, it consumes 16.5\u03bcW and has a gain of 66+dBs and a bandwidth of 10 KHz. Its gain and linearity are not sensitive to power supply variations, making it suitable for feeding by a paper battery when recording brain neural signals from moving flies. The designed amplifier is capable of driving a 10pF capacitive load therefore it can be directly connected to an oscilloscope or an ADC input.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5516098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5516098/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11495143","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power Low-Distortion Amplifier for Fly Neural Recordings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power Low-Distortion Amplifier for Fly Neural Recordings","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"02-04-009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066037S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5513048","isNumber":"5514659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5513048","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5514659","articleId":"5516098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5516104,"authors":[{"name":"J.-G.

Main difficulty is that the vehicle-tire dynamics is a nonlinear process. Secondly, controls of antilock, traction, yaw stability and braking force distribution operate for different objectives. Therefore, the integrated brake controller has to satisfy multiple objectives subject to constraints imposed by the nonlinear vehicle-tire dynamics. This paper presents a method of reinforcement synthesis to automatically synthesize an integrated brake control policy. The control objectives are expressed by a cost function and the reinforcement synthesis algorithm adapts the controller, a radial basis function network (RBFN), to minimize the cost. With sufficient training, the RBFN would be optimized for performing integrated brake control. The obtained controller is investigated for critical tests of a vehicle simulating on CarSim. Results show that reinforcement synthesis can work out a useful integrated brake controller.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5516740","startPage":"29","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th

The neural network controller comprises two similar adaptive linear neurons (ADALINE), and it has been designed to extract fundamental frequency components from non-sinusoidal and unbalanced currents instead of conventional low pass filter. Reactive power compensation is done without sensing load currents, which gives simplicity in control with less number of current sensors. The performance of the APF with the proposed neural network compensation algorithm is found to be considerably effective and adequate to compensate harmonics and reactive power. The results show excellent behaviors and performances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5516896/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11433888","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5516896/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based shunt active filter for harmonic and reactive power compensation under non-ideal mains voltage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based shunt active filter for harmonic and reactive power compensation under non-ideal mains voltage","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp069P0824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060063S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5516896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5516907,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang-Jin Koh","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA","Intel Corp., Hillsboro, Oregon"],"firstName":"Kwang-Jin","lastName":"Koh","id":"37393642300"},{"name":"Gabriel M.

The comparative experiments of both local FD and curvature analysis show that the features difference of adjacent scales has characteristics of larger inter-class Hausdorff distance with the scale increase, while local FD performs better than curvature analysis with larger Hausdorff distance value.

In general, it is difficult to adopt a model-based design to achieve this control objective due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances and parameter variations. In order to cope with this problem, a DAFNNC strategy is investigated without the requirement of prior system information. In this model-free control topology, a FNN controller is directly designed to imitate a predetermined model-based stabilizing control law, and then the stable control performance can be achieved by only using joint position information. The DAFNNC law and the adaptive tuning algorithms for FNN weights are established in the sense of Lyapunov stability analyses to ensure the stable control performance. Numerical simulations of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by DC servomotors are given to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. In addition, the superiority of the proposed control scheme is indicated in comparison with proportional-differential control (PDC), fuzzy-model-based control (FMBC), T-S type fuzzy-neural-network control (T-FNNC), and robust-neural-fuzzy-network control (RNFNC) systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5516980","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05516980.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5516980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control for robot manipulator by using only position measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5516980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Direct adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control for robot manipulator by using only position measurements","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11433971","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5516980/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control for robot manipulator by using only position measurements","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp126P0363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075293S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5516980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5516984,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ran","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Li Ran","id":"37532384800"},{"name":"Wu Junfeng","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Wu Junfeng","id":"37544724700"},{"name":"Wang Haiying","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Wang Haiying","id":"37444673200"},{"name":"Li Gechen","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Li Gechen","id":"37542084300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5045-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5046-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"5516984","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2563},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","Battery charge measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Equivalent circuits","Frequency measurement","Time measurement","Electrodes","Kinetic theory","Voltage","Shape measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","least squares approximations","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium-ion rechargeable battery","electrochemical impedance spectroscopy theory","inductive arc","capacitive arc","low-frequency region","nonlinear least square fitting procedure","equivalent series capacitance","state of charge values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS)","state-of-charge(SOC)","predict"]}],"abstract":"For the purpose of predicting the state of charge of Lithium-ion rechargeable battery accurately, we introduced the method of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to solve the problem.

MPSO takes advantage of multiple sub-swarms with mixed search behavior to maintain the swarm diversity, and introduces cooperative mechanism to prompt the information exchange among sub-swarms. Moreover, MPSO adopts an adaptive reinitializing strategy guided by swarm diversity, which can contribute to the global convergence of the algorithm. Through the mixed local search behavior modes, the cooperative search and the reinitializing strategy guided by swarm diversity, MPSO can maintain appropriate diversity and keep the balance of local search and global search validly.

Typically, quarter-wavelength stubs for the second and third harmonics are placed at selected distances from the drain in order to create the required harmonic impedances inside the RF-power transistor. This paper presents an analogous technique using lumped-elements networks. This technique not only allows the networks to be adjusted for the frequency of operation, but also allows operation at lower frequencies (e.g., VHF and HF) where transmission-line networks are impractical. The new technique is verified by experiment with a second-harmonic class-E power amplifier. This amplifier operates at 900-MHz achieving 10-W output power and 73% drain efficiency with either type of network.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Frequency","Power amplifiers","Hafnium","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Signal processing","Power engineering and energy","Impedance","Transmission lines","Power generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517047","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517047.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lumped-element output networks for high-efficiency power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lumped-element output networks for high-efficiency power amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517047/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lumped-element output networks for high-efficiency power amplifiers","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TUPC1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031168S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5517047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5517056,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As a result, it is known that the novel method is very accurate as an HTS LIM optimization technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5517100","publicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5508196/5514667/05517100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2010.5517100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514667","startPage":"527","endPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of HTS Linear Induction Motor using GA and the Finite Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of HTS Linear Induction Motor using GA and the Finite Element Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517100/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11433921","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5517100/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of HTS Linear Induction Motor using GA and the Finite Element Method","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"rp096P0506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057451S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5508196","isNumber":"5514667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5508196","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5514667","articleId":"5517100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5517104,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These results demonstrate the capability of 256 nm InP DHBT technology to enable sophisticated single-chip heterodyne receivers and exciters for operation at THz frequencies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517225.pdf","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1129","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THz MMICs based on InP HBT Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Indium phosphide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","DH-HEMTs","Integrated circuit interconnections","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Integrated circuit technology","Submillimeter wave technology","Bipolar transistors","Monolithic integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency dividers","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","MMIC","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["THz MMIC","HBT technology","double-heterojunction bipolar transistor","terahertz monolithic integrated circuits","microstrip lines","high-density thin-film interconnects","TMIC low noise","driver amplifiers","voltage controlled oscillators","dynamic frequency dividers","double-balanced Gilbert cell mixers","size 256 nm","frequency 808 GHz","voltage 4 V","InP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Submillimeter-wave","terahertz","TMIC","indium phosphide (InP) DHBT bipolar transistor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"THz MMICs based on InP HBT Technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5517225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11452979","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THz MMICs based on InP HBT Technology","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083966S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5517228,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The new approach is based on the power wave renormalization of admittance parameters of a matched filter with a complex load to unitary load. When the port reference is changed from a complex load to a real load, a set of new expressions of admittance parameters can be obtained for the same filter. By introducing a piece of dispersive transmission line to the original matched filter, the poles of the original admittance parameters are retained, which greatly facilitates the extraction of the new admittance parameters, and consequently the synthesis of the coupling matrix. The approach is applicable to the synthesis of an optimal channel filter of a diplexer and a multiplexer, where the load presented at a port of the filter is a frequency variant complex load in a wide frequency range.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517318","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517318.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct synthesis of general Chebyshev bandpass filters with a frequency variant complex load","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Direct synthesis of general Chebyshev bandpass filters with a frequency variant complex load","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517318/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct synthesis of general Chebyshev bandpass filters with a frequency variant complex load","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WE1B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076861S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5517318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5517408,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As the PA is a band-pass system, the model that processes the complex envelope of the input signal is restricted to the generation of only the first zone output components. It is shown here that such restriction has been interpreted in a too conservative way in the conventional Volterra series based models. Alternatively, we propose a new model formulation which incorporates the band-pass restriction in a more suitable way, significantly increasing the flexibility of the Volterra-based PA models in general.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power system modeling","Kernel","Telecommunications","Signal processing","Signal generators","Nonlinear systems","Communication industry","Circuit simulation","Power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","power amplifiers","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar oriented Volterra model","power amplifier characterization","low pass equivalent Volterra series","band pass system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modeling","nonlinear systems","power amplifiers","Volterra series"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517544","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517544.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A polar-oriented Volterra model for power amplifier characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A polar-oriented Volterra model for power amplifier characterization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517544/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5517544/","accessionNumber":"11453112","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A polar-oriented Volterra model for power amplifier characterization","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058007S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5517561,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Alternative wideband matching and output connection schemes for Doherty amplifiers are evaluated for their efficiency performance both at full output power, as well as, in power back-off operation.

It is shown that, by using a re-optimized load line, the efficiency can be increased from 37.5% to 47% at nominal 28.5 dBm output power, while maintaining the same excellent linearity of the original PA. The quiescent current consumption is also reduced down to 40 mA at all power levels, enabling up to 49% average dc power savings without dynamic biasing. Under 2:1 VSWR, 7% to 11% higher PAE is demonstrated at 28 dBm, achieving significant ACPR reduction as well. The methodology to tradeoff the linearization capability of DPD to optimize efficiency at a specified power and linearity is discussed in detail.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517640.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"807","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency improvement of a handset WCDMA PA module using Adaptive Digital Predistortion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telephone sets","Multiaccess communication","Predistortion","Linearity","Gallium arsenide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Power generation","Optimization methods","Power amplifiers","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","heterojunction bipolar transistors","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive digital predistortion","WCDMA handset","quiescent current consumption","VSWR","HBT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Amplifier","Digital Predistortion","GaAs HBT","WCDMA","Efficiency","Decresting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency improvement of a handset WCDMA PA module using Adaptive Digital Predistortion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5517640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453081","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency improvement of a handset WCDMA PA module using Adaptive Digital Predistortion","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049708S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5517652,"authors":[{"name":"Reinel Marante","affiliation":["Dpto.

The results show that both techniques perform equally well for back-off levels \u2264 6.5 dB. At higher back-off levels, the efficiency improvements achieved by supply modulation outperform load modulation. At 10 dB back-off, supply, and load modulation provide a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 68%, and 58%, respectively. Using measured intrinsic waveforms, it is shown that PAE degradations in load modulation can be mainly attributed to parallel losses rather than series losses, which are dominant in supply modulation. The harmonic contents of the intrinsic waveforms, in both techniques, are equally strong in back-off and peak power operations. There is, therefore, a great potential for further efficiency enhancement by circuit-level optimization of harmonic terminations for back-off.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International

To the authors' best knowledge, this T-ILFT achieves the highest operation frequency for injection-locked-based frequency multipliers, reported to date.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517773","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517773.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 85-95.2 GHz transformer-based injection-locked frequency tripler in 65nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An 85-95.2 GHz transformer-based injection-locked frequency tripler in 65nm CMOS","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11452911","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5517773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 85-95.2 GHz transformer-based injection-locked frequency tripler in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041044S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5517777,"authors":[{"name":"Ildu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ildu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291701800"},{"name":"Bumman Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bumman","lastName":"Kim","id":"37276226900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5517777","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":935},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Peak to average power ratio","WiMAX","Transmitters","Linearity","Bandwidth","Linearization techniques","Design optimization","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication standards","transmitters","UHF power amplifiers","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3-stage Doherty power amplifier","envelope tracking","IEEE 802.16e","world interoperability for microwave access","WiMAX","peak to average power ratio","quiescent bias point","load modulation","saturated operation","ADS simulation","Matlab simulation","linear base-station transmitter","frequency 2.655 GHz","bandwidth 20 MHz"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.655 GHz 3-stage Doherty power amplifier using envelope tracking technique","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","endPage":"1499","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517777.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517777","startPage":"1496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517777","abstract":"We demonstrates an optimized design of a highly efficient 3-stage Doherty PA for the 802.16e Mobile world interoperability for microwave access(WiMAX) application at 2.655-GHz. The `3-stage' Doherty PA is the most efficient architecture among the various Doherty PAs for a high peak to average power ratio(PAPR) signal. However, due to the low quiescent bias point of the peaking PA, it has an improper load modulation problem, which causes over saturated operation of the carrier PA and insufficient peak power. We have solved the problem using a gate envelope tracking(ET) technique. Using the ADS and Matlab simulations, the behavior of the 3-stage Doherty PA employing the ET technique is presented. For the WiMAX signal with a 7.8 ~ 8.5 dB PAPR and 20-MHz instantaneous bandwidth, the measured efficiency of the proposed 3-stage Doherty PA has been maintained 56.7% at an average output power of 43.3 dBm, a 7.2 dB backed-off output power from peak output power level. These experimental results clearly show that the 3-stage Doherty with ET technique has a superior efficiency with high peak power. The PAs accompanied with the DPD are very good candidates for the highly efficient and linear base-station transmitter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11453056","htmlLink":"/document/5517777/","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 2.655 GHz 3-stage Doherty power amplifier using envelope tracking technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.655 GHz 3-stage Doherty power amplifier using envelope tracking technique","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049868S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5517779,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoguo Cui","affiliation":["Yunyang Medical College, Shiyan, China","College of Computer, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoguo","lastName":"Cui","id":"37529526000"},{"name":"Caibi Peng","affiliation":["Taihe Hospital of Yunyang Medical College, Shiyan, China"],"firstName":"Caibi","lastName":"Peng","id":"37536558500"},{"name":"Dong C.

Measuring using a CDMA IS-95 signal at 900 MHz, it achieves 49.3% efficiency at 26.6-dBm output power level while passing the adjacent and alternate channel power ratio requirements without using any pre-distortion or calibration.

The results of a full-wave EM simulation of the harvesting antenna are rigorously handled by EM theory to produce a Norton equivalent circuit of the antenna in the presence of an incident field. In turn, this allows a full nonlinear analysis of the rectifier to be carried out, thus providing an accurate evaluation of the conversion efficiency. For validation purposes we consider a circularly polarized rectifying antenna (rectenna) designed to harvest energy from RF sources (such as mobile phones and/or base stations) at GSM 1800 standard frequencies. The computed and measured performance of a prototype rectenna compare very favorably in different real-world scenarios including near- and far-field situations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAD procedure for predicting the energy received by wireless scavenging systems in the near- and far-field regions","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517916","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05517916.pdf","startPage":"1768","endPage":"1771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"CAD procedure for predicting the energy received by wireless scavenging systems in the near- and far-field regions","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5517916/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11452925","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAD procedure for predicting the energy received by wireless scavenging systems in the near- and far-field regions","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039441S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5517920,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungwook Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Hyungwook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37310769700"},{"name":"Youngchang Yoon","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Youngchang","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37539938400"},{"name":"Ockgoo Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Ockgoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37266832400"},{"name":"Kyu Hwan An","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Kyu Hwan","lastName":"An","id":"37305827000"},{"name":"Dong Ho Lee","affiliation":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Cedar Rapids, IA, USA","Skyworks, Cedar Rapids, IA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Dong Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085360800"},{"name":"Woonyun Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Design Center, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Woonyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37536466800"},{"name":"Chang-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Design Center, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Chang-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280404200"},{"name":"Joy Laskar","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Joy","lastName":"Laskar","id":"37280282800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5517920","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":896},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","GSM","Impedance matching","Capacitors","CMOS technology","Power generation","Network-on-a-chip","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","capacitors","cellular radio","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-integrated CMOS RF power amplifier","GSM-EDGE dual-mode application","variable capacitor","EDGE modulation signal","error vector magnitude","EVM","PAE","matching network","switching mode","linear mode","size 0.18 mum","frequency 1.76 GHz","efficiency 28.1 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear PA","power amplifiers","power combining","switching PA","variable capacitor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5517920","abstract":"A fully integrated power amplifier operating at switching and linear mode is implemented using 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology.

With the use of an active load and a cascode HBT, a fine tuning range of gain up to 2.8 dB over 1.3 to 1.5 GHz and a coarse tuning range of gain up to 23 dB across 0.7 to 1.5 GHz have been successively achieved. Since the frequency response including lower and higher band-edge frequencies as well as gain level can be tuned independently, the amplifier is considered to greatly contribute to realizing the next generation reconfigurable wireless transceivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5517933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5517933/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11452758","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An L-band gain and bandwidth tunable low-noise differential amplifier using varactor-tuned bias circuits and active loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An L-band gain and bandwidth tunable low-noise differential amplifier using varactor-tuned bias circuits and active loads","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057798S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5517933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5517940,"authors":[{"name":"Charles F.

The PA is fabricated using a 400 W push-pull laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) field-effect transistor (FET) for an ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. The drain current of a single LDMOS FET is 9.5 A at P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SAT</sub>\n. The drain voltages used in the control are set to 40 V and 20 V. Measurement results indicate a power-added efficiency (PAE) in the case of dynamic drain voltage control of 34%, which is 15% higher than PAE at a drain voltage of 40 V. This is the highest output power of a PA with a dynamic drain voltage control to the best of our knowledge.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-efficiency 400 W power amplifier with dynamic drain voltage control for 6 MHz OFDM signal","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5518036","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05518036.pdf","startPage":"936","endPage":"939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5518036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"High-efficiency 400 W power amplifier with dynamic drain voltage control for 6 MHz OFDM signal","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518036/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11452761","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-efficiency 400 W power amplifier with dynamic drain voltage control for 6 MHz OFDM signal","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053078S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5518036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5518084,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

Five morphologic features and three texture features are extracted from each breast ultrasound image. The AP clustering with an empirical value of \"preference\" is used as the primary classification to classify tumors into five clusters with each cluster enjoying specific and similar features and holding a certain probability to be malignant. Then, five clusters are further classified into benign and malignant according to their feature distribution. The proposed system is validated by experiments of 132 cases (including 67 benign tumors and 65 malignant ones) with its performance compared with those of popular methods such as the back propagation artificial neural network (ANN), the self-organizing mapping ANN and the support vector machine (SVM). Results show that the proposed system which needs no training procedure performs well in the ultrasonic classification of breast tumors with the highest accuracy of 94.7%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

A novel envelope shaping method is applied for high power-added efficiency (PAE) over a broad output power range. Experimental comparison with the Doherty and saturated PAs with the supply modulator is carried out. For the 8 dB crest factor WCDMA 1FA signal, the Doherty PA supported by the modulator presents the improved PAE over the broad output power region compared to the standalone Doherty PA. In addition, it achieves better PAE than the saturated PA with the supply modulator due to the lower crest factor envelope signal applied to the Doherty PA. At the maximum average output power, back-off by 8 dB from the peak power, the Doherty amplifier employing bias adaptation shows the PAE of 50.9%, while the comparable saturated PA with supply modulator and standalone saturated Doherty amplifier and saturated PA provide the PAEs of 42.3%, 49.7%, and 35.0%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5518222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5518222","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1089","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503841/5514662/05518222.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5514662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doherty amplifier with envelope tracking for high efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Doherty amplifier with envelope tracking for high efficiency","conferenceDate":"23-28 May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518222/","accessionNumber":"11452805","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518222/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doherty amplifier with envelope tracking for high efficiency","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046867S","chronDate":"23-28 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5503841","isNumber":"5514662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5503841","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5514662","articleId":"5518222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5518238,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoung-Jun Kim","affiliation":["Center of Distributed Sensor Network, Department of Nanobio Materials and Electronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Jun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406291400"},{"name":"Jong-In Song","affiliation":["Center of Distributed Sensor Network, Department of Nanobio Materials and Electronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-In","lastName":"Song","id":"37277430600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6058-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6056-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7732-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6057-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"CD","value":"0149-645X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0149-645X"}],"articleNumber":"5518238","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Stimulated emission","Optical noise","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical mixing","Radio frequency","RF signals","Delay lines","Signal generators","Local oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre amplifiers","phase noise","radio-over-fibre","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise optimization","all-optical frequency upconverter","optical interleaver","semiconductor optical amplifier","radio-over-fiber applications","SOA","optical radio frequency","optical intermediate frequency signal","optical local oscillator signal","frequency 25 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["all-optical frequency converter","photonic frequency converter","frequency conversion","wavelength conversion","phase noise","single sideband (SSB)","radio-over-fiber (RoF)","semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)"]}],"abstract":"An all-optical frequency upconverter using an optical interleaver and a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) has been experimentally demonstrated for radio-over-fiber (RoF) applications.

The aim of the method is to enable the use of reconstruction filters with wider passband, or alternatively, a lower switch-rate. The method uses a general representation of the \u03a3\u0394 converters in combination with a differentiable approximation of the quantizer. Based on this, a Monte Carlo-based algorithm is developed around the damped Gauss-Newton iteration. As a result of the suggested algorithm, the residual quantization noise after reconstruction filtering is significantly decreased. Finally, simulations using a bandlimited signal with a Gaussian distribution are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the suggested algorithm when applied with the proposed \u03a3\u0394 modulator representation. The resulting performance is compared to several cases of \u03a3\u0394 converters designed using traditional methods, demonstrating significant improvements in terms of reduced reconstruction normalized mean square error. This implies that the transmitter efficiency can be improved with minor changes in the modulator implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","volume":"57","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"11693108","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518336/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantization Noise Minimization in <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\Sigma\\Delta$</tex></formula> Modulation Based RF Transmitter Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization Noise Minimization in <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\Sigma\\Delta$</tex></formula> Modulation Based RF Transmitter Architectures","sourcePdf":"57tcsi12-ugustavsson-2052512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084888S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5667090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5667090","articleId":"5518336","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5518342,"authors":[{"name":"Senad Bulja","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5518342/5518342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Senad Bulja (S'04\u2013M'07) was born in Kosovska Mitrovica, former Yugoslavia., in 1977.

In order to optimize the design of tunable millimeter-wave devices, accurate values of the dielectric and elastic constants, as well as the loss tangents of LCs, are needed. However, characterization of LCs at millimeter-wave frequencies is a very challenging and demanding task. In this work, a transmission line method is used for the broadband characterization of nematic LCs in the frequency range of 30-60 GHz. For this purpose, a unique LC cell is proposed and using this, five different nematic LCs, including E7, K15, E44, E63, and MDA-00-3506, are measured and the values of their electrical and mechanical parameters are extracted. The extraction of these parameters from the measurements involves an optimization using two finite-element computer programs recently developed by the authors for the prediction of the local alignments of LC molecules and the wave propagation within the test cell. The highest values of the dielectric birefringence and the highest values of the loss tangents are recorded for E44 and MDA-00-3506. The loss tangent for all the LCs shows a general downward trend as the frequency increases, which is a useful characteristic in the development of reconfigurable millimeter-wave devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","volume":"58","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"11692676","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518342/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of Dielectric Properties of Nematic Liquid Crystals at Millimeter Wavelength","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of Dielectric Properties of Nematic Liquid Crystals at Millimeter Wavelength","sourcePdf":"tmtt-bulja-2054332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08207S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5662237","articleId":"5518342","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5518348,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Tang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5961802/5518348/5518348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Tang (S'07) received the B.S. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. and M.Phil. degrees from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2008 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.","He is a visiting Researcher of Chongqing Three Gorges University, China.

While the focus of much of the prior art is on supply noise in oscillators, this paper illustrates that supply noise in other building blocks also contribute significantly to PLL output jitter. Analytical expressions for supply-noise sensitivities are derived for each of the circuit blocks used in the PLL and insight into the mechanism through which supply noise appears at the PLL output is provided. Efficient supply-regulation schemes that combine a split-tuned PLL architecture with an optimized low-dropout regulator to achieve better than -22 dB of worst case supply-noise sensitivity for the whole PLL are presented. Fabricated in a 0.18 \u03bcm digital CMOS process, the prototype PLL occupies an area of 0.18 \u03bcm and operates from a 1.8 V supply. At 1.5 GHz, the total power consumption is 3.3 mW, of which 0.54 mW is consumed in the regulators.

We propose two new cooperative spectrum sensing strategies, called amplify-and-relay (AR) and detect-and-relay (DR), aiming at improving the detection performance with the help of other eligible SUs so as to agilely vacate the channel to the primary network when the neighboring PUs switch to active state. AR and DR strategies are periodically executed during the spectrum sensing phase which is arranged at the beginning of each MAC frame. Based on AR and DR strategies, we derive the closed-form expressions of false alarm probability and detection probability for both single-relay and multi-relay models, with or without channel state information (CSI). Simulation results show that our proposed strategies achieve better performance than a non-cooperative (or non-relay) spectrum sensing method and an existing cooperative detection method. As expected, we observe that the detection performance improves as the number of eligible relay SUs increases, and furthermore, it is better for the known-CSI case than that of the unknown-CSI case.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2060468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5689326/05518367.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2060468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"56","endPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Strategies for Cognitive Radio Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Strategies for Cognitive Radio Mesh Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518367/","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5518367/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759840","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Strategies for Cognitive Radio Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-chen-2060468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083758S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5689326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5689326","articleId":"5518367","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5518372,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Irving, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280262200"},{"name":"Theodoros A.

However, the design of the power supply is challenging due to the changing nature of the load presented by mobile pickups. An inverter driving a traditional single-phase system must be designed with only the peak power in mind, as the reactive load of the pickups is essentially constant due to the relatively constrained pickup movement and will normally be compensated when the system is designed. This is not possible for an inverter driving a polyphase track, as the reactive load will vary with the lateral position of the pickup, just as a portion of the real load that must be supplied by each phase will also vary. This paper presents a simple but accurate method of determining the real and reactive load on each phase of the track as the pickup moves, allowing the inverter to be correctly designed with appropriate component ratings.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2060455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5765746/05518424.pdf","startPage":"2274","endPage":"2282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2060455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-State Flat-Pickup Loading Effects in Polyphase Inductive Power Transfer Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518424/","displayDocTitle":"Steady-State Flat-Pickup Loading Effects in Polyphase Inductive Power Transfer Systems","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11988558","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518424/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-State Flat-Pickup Loading Effects in Polyphase Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-kissin-2060455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086004S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5765746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5765746","articleId":"5518424","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5518428,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Huan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5518428/5518428-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Huan Lee (S'09) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1977.

In this paper, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HepG2) is treated by a single-electrode plasma jet device. Further investigation by using flow cytometric analysis demonstrates that plasma treatment increases the percentage of apoptotic cells being associated with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Moreover, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay shows that the cyclin B1 and Cdc2 are decreased at the transcription level after plasma treatment, while the expression of the p21 Cdk inhibitor, as well as that of tumor suppressor p53, is enhanced. On the other hand, the levels of certain pro- or antiapoptotic genes are checked, and the experimental results suggest that the plasma induces apoptosis by shifting the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio to trigger HepG2 cell apoptosis. The results of the present investigation indicate that the plasma jet device may have potential therapeutic activities, such as sterilization of living tissue and tumor therapy of the postoperative treatment process.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2010.2056393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5568513/05518431.pdf","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2010.2056393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5568513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mechanism of Plasma Inducing Cell Apoptosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518431/","displayDocTitle":"On the Mechanism of Plasma Inducing Cell Apoptosis","volume":"38","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523196","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518431/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mechanism of Plasma Inducing Cell Apoptosis","sourcePdf":"tps-lu-2056393-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097532S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5568513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5568513","articleId":"5518431","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5518436,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Dore","affiliation":["Imperial College London, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/5602001/5518436/5518436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessio Dore (S'07) received the M.Sc.

New research trends for reaching this goal are based on neurophysiological observations of human brain structure and functioning. A learning technique that is used to provide the SS with the so-called Autobiographical Memory is presented here by drawing inspiration from a bio-inspired model of the interactions occurring between the system and the user. Starting from the hypothesis that user's actions have a direct influence on the internal system state variables and vice versa, a statistical voting algorithm is proposed for inferring the cause/effect relationships among users and the system. The main contribution of this paper lies in proposing a general framework that is able to allow the SS to be aware of its present state as well as of the behavior of its users and to be able to predict the expected consequences of user actions.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2052600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and

The jumping parameters are modeled as a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. Based on a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the stochastic analysis theory, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive some novel sufficient conditions, which guarantee the exponential stability of the equilibrium point in the mean square. The proposed LMI-based criteria are quite general since many factors, such as noise perturbations, Markovian jump parameters, and mixed time delays, are considered. In particular, the mixed time delays in this paper synchronously consist of constant, time-varying, and distributed delays, which are more general than those discussed in the previous literature. In the latter, either constant and distributed delays or time-varying and distributed delays are only included. Therefore, the results obtained in this paper generalize and improve those given in the previous literature. Two numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results and demonstrate that the stability criteria used in the earlier literature fail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11862704","pubMedId":"20656658","volume":"41","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5518439/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exponential Stability of Stochastic Neural Networks With Both Markovian Jump Parameters and Mixed Time Delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Stability of Stochastic Neural Networks With Both Markovian Jump Parameters and Mixed Time Delays","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhu-2053354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095739S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5730604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5730604","articleId":"5518439","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5518442,"authors":[{"name":"Edit Varga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Edit","lastName":"Varga","id":"37543597800"},{"name":"Alexei Orlov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Orlov","id":"37270346300"},{"name":"Michael T.

However, obtaining a rigorous understanding of the possible MIMO gains in multihop networks is still an open topic. One grand challenge is that multihop wireless networks are interference limited and that the interference introduces coupling across various layers of the protocol stack, including the physical (PHY), medium access control (MAC), network, and transport layers. The fundamental differences between multihop networks and point-to-point settings dictate that leveraging the MIMO gains in multihop networks requires a domain change from high-SNR regimes to interference-limited regimes. In this paper, we develop a cross-layer optimization framework for effective interference management toward understanding fundamental tradeoffs among possible MIMO gains in multihop networks. We first take a bottom-up approach to develop a MIMO-pipe model based on PHY interference and extract a set of {(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ri</i>\n, SINR\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i>\n) }, where each pair (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ri</i>\n, SINR\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i>\n) corresponds to a meaningful stream multiplexing configuration for individual MIMO links [with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ri</i>\n being the rate and SINR\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i>\n being the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement]. Using this link abstraction model, we study MIMO-pipe scheduling for throughput maximization. Based on continuous relaxation via randomization, we study the structural property of the optimal scheduling policy. Our findings reveal that, in an optimal strategy, it suffices for each MIMO link to use one stream configuration only (although each individual MIMO link can have multiple stream configurations). In light of this structural property, we then formulate MIMO-pipe scheduling as a combinatorial optimization problem, and by using a multidimensional 0-1 knapsack approach, we devise centralized approximation algorithms for both the dense network model and the extended network model, respectively. Next, we also develop a contention-based distributed algorithm, in which links update their contention probability based on local information only, and characterize the convergence and the performance of the distributed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2060376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5601981/05518451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2060376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601981","startPage":"3966","endPage":"3978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-Pipe Modeling and Scheduling for Efficient Interference Management in Multihop MIMO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-Pipe Modeling and Scheduling for Efficient Interference Management in Multihop MIMO Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588234","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5518451/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-Pipe Modeling and Scheduling for Efficient Interference Management in Multihop MIMO Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2060376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117185S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5601981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5601981","articleId":"5518451","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5518452,"authors":[{"name":"Raghavendra V.

Developers of WSNs face challenges that arise from communication link failures, memory and computational constraints, and limited energy. Many issues in WSNs are formulated as multidimensional optimization problems, and approached through bioinspired techniques. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a simple, effective, and computationally efficient optimization algorithm. It has been applied to address WSN issues such as optimal deployment, node localization, clustering, and data aggregation. This paper outlines issues in WSNs, introduces PSO, and discusses its suitability for WSN applications.

The proposed compensation maintains the fast load transient response of the conventional Type III compensator; while the Type III compensator response is synthesized by adding a high-gain low-frequency path (via error amplifier) with a moderate-gain high-frequency path (via bandpass filter) at the inputs of PWM comparator. As such, smaller passive components and low-power active circuits can be used to generate two zeros required in a Type III compensator.

Two prototype chips are fabricated in a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process with constant Gm/C biasing technique being applied to one of the designs. Measurement result shows that converter output is settled within 7 \u03bcs for a load current step of 500 mA. Peak efficiency of 97% is obtained at 360 mW output power, and high efficiency of 86% is measured for output power as low as 60 mW.

Analog switching errors and timing jitter are known limitations to the dynamic range in these types of switching audio drivers. To overcome these limitations the Class-D architecture chosen in this paper provides a low 667 kHz pulse rate. This architecture is based on a 4th-order digital modulator with pulse-width modulation (PWM) feedback. The modulator loop processes the PWM signals at a high 24 MHz clock rate, and provides pulse edge timing resolution within a single clock period of the high-rate clock. Timing distortion errors due to uniform sampling of the low-rate PWM signals are reduced with the high forward loop gain of the digital modulator feedback loop. The driver receives a 22-bit digital audio input and combines the functionality of a high-fidelity digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with a speaker driver. It achieves 120 dB dynamic range over a 20 kHz bandwidth, provides 88% power efficiency while driving an 8 \u03a9 speaker load, and consumes a total quiescent current of 2.4 mA.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2047426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5518480/05518486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2047426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518480","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 120 dB Dynamic Range 400 mW Class-D Speaker Driver With Fourth-Order PWM Modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 120 dB Dynamic Range 400 mW Class-D Speaker Driver With Fourth-Order PWM Modulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11433053","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5518486/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 120 dB Dynamic Range 400 mW Class-D Speaker Driver With Fourth-Order PWM Modulator","sourcePdf":"45jssc08-mwang-2047426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5518480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5518480","articleId":"5518486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5518487,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Rossi","affiliation":["Advanced Research Centre on Electronic Systems, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5518480/5518487/5518487-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Rossi received the electronics engineering degree from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, and the M.Sc. degree from Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in 2007.

If employed in a PLL, the combined VCO/divider (C-VCO/D) would potentially provide wider tuning range than traditional mm-wave PLLs employing injection locked frequency dividers, thus exploiting the full range available in the 60 GHz band (57 GHz-64 GHz). The behavior of triple push oscillators based on injection locking theory is analyzed to study their various oscillation modes, their stability and the effect of mismatch on the oscillator performance. Design guidelines are provided for boosting the third harmonic power at a given power budget. Using 130 nm IBM CMOS technology, multiple versions of the triple push oscillator are implemented and characterized.

The continuous-time input approach overcomes many of the challenges associated with a pure switched-capacitor architecture. The resistive input load of the two new architectures provides a benign interface to external drive circuitry. The switched-capacitor sampling function is moved to the second stage input which greatly eases the sampling distortion requirements and obviates the need for an explicit front-end sample-and-hold function. The second ADC presented additionally provides inherent anti-alias filtering, allowing the possibility of eliminating costly anti-alias filters. This second architecture also eases the jitter requirements of the ADC clock when compared to switched capacitor pipeline ADCs.

A theoretical model of pulse propagation in SOAs is developed that includes the ASE power and its effect on gain-saturation and gain-recovery. We study the impact of ASE on the nonlinear phase shift, frequency chirp, spectrum, and shape of amplified picosecond pulses at a range of drive currents. We verify our predictions experimentally by launching gain-switched picosecond pulses with 3-mW peak power into a commercial SOA exhibiting 9-ps gain-recovery time at a current of 500 mA. Understanding the impact of ASE on SOAs is important for applications that employs SOAs for all-optical signal processing and as data-network amplifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5518533/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11452525","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Self-Phase Modulation in Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers: Impact of Amplified Spontaneous Emission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Phase Modulation in Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers: Impact of Amplified Spontaneous Emission","sourcePdf":"jqe-pbaveja-2048743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093748S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5518511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5518511","articleId":"5518533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5518543,"authors":[{"name":"Haixian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Applied Mathematics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Haixian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086191113"},{"name":"Zhang Yi","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence Laboratory School of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Yi","id":"37087216814"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6502-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6499-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6501-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-8123"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-8239"}],"articleNumber":"5518543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518543","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Encoding","Shape control","Neurons","Mathematics","Machine intelligence","Laboratories","Computer science","Stationary state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous attractors","dynamic shift mechanism","recurrent neural networks","Gaussian shape","Gaussian weight function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["continuous Attractors","Dynamic Shift Mechanism","Shift Speed","Symmetric Gaussian Function","Recurrent Neural Networks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518538","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2010.5518543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic shift mechanism of continuous attractors in a class of recurrent neural networks","startPage":"339","endPage":"343","pdfPath":"/iel5/5507897/5518538/05518543.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2010.5518543","abstract":"Continuous attractors of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have attracted extensive interests in recent years.

It shows that if the external input is a gaussian shape with its center varying along with time, by adding a slight shift to the weights, the symmetry of gaussian weight function is destroyed. Then, the activity profile will shift continuously without changing its shape, and the shift speed can be controlled accurately by a given constant.

However, motivational aspects like engagement play an important role in effective learning-engaged learners gain more. E-Learning systems could be improved by tracking students' disengagement that, in turn, would allow personalized interventions at appropriate times in order to reengage students. This idea has been exploited several times for Intelligent Tutoring Systems, but not yet in other types of learning environments that are less structured. To address this gap, our research looks at online learning-content-delivery systems using educational data mining techniques. Previously, several attributes relevant for disengagement prediction were identified by means of log-file analysis on HTML-Tutor, a web-based learning environment. In this paper, we investigate the extendibility of our approach to other systems by studying the relevance of these attributes for predicting disengagement in a different e-learning system. To this end, two validation studies were conducted indicating that the previously identified attributes are pertinent for disengagement prediction, and two new meta-attributes derived from log-data observations improve prediction and may potentially be used for automatic log-file annotation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2011","volume":"4","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12047260","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"April-June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5518758/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Disengagement Detection in Online Learning: Validation Studies and Perspectives","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Disengagement Detection in Online Learning: Validation Studies and Perspectives","sourcePdf":"tlt2011020114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105132S","chronDate":"April-June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"5871827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5871827","articleId":"5518758","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":5518762,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Bachour","affiliation":["EPFL-CRAFT, Rolex Learning Center, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/5569067/5518762/5518762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khaled Bachour received the master's degree in computer science from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon.

Our design moves forward the state of the art in several ways while having a simple structure. Specifically, the CE only needs to observe the number of successes and failures associated with each set of channel conditions and communication method. From these two numbers, the CE can derive all of its functionality. First, it can estimate confidence intervals of the packet success rate (PSR) using the Beta distribution. A low computational approximation to the CDF of the Beta distribution is also presented. Second, the designed CE balances the tradeoff between learning and short-term performance (exploration {vs.} exploitation) by applying the Gittins index. Third, the CE learns the radio abilities independently of the operation objectives. Thus, if an objective changes, information regarding the radio's abilities is not lost. Finally, prior knowledge such as capacity, BER curves, and basic communication principles are used to both initialize the CE's knowledge and maximize the learning rate across different channel conditions. The proposed CE is demonstrated to have the ability to learn in a dynamic scenario and quickly approach maximal performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5518773/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527928","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Engine Design for Link Adaptation: An Application to Multi-Antenna Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Engine Design for Link Adaptation: An Application to Multi-Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"2902-tw1009-volos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099244S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5518773","onlineDate":"23 July 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5518774,"authors":[{"name":"Youngju Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngju","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280927300"},{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungeun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407202900"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5518774","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2159},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Femtocell networks","Macrocell networks","Ultrafast electronics","Information geometry","Capacity planning","Interference constraints","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-tier femtocell network","outage constraint","cochannel femtocell deployment","cellular geometry","cross-tier interference","per-tier outage probability","femtocell interference distribution","outage probability analysis","transmission capacity","cochannel two-tier network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell networks","cochannel deployment","outage probability","transmission capacity"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the performance of two-tier femtocell networks with cochannel femtocell deployment while considering cellular geometry and cross-tier interference in downlink.

In the present paper, the non-convex objective function of the power allocation problem aiming at maximizing the sum rate with a total power constraint is reformulated as a difference of two concave functions. A global optimum power allocation is found by applying a branch and bound based algorithm to the new formulation. The algorithm basically splits the feasible region consecutively into subregions where for every subregion the objective function is upper and lower bounded. For a certain partition of the feasible region, a power allocation corresponding to the highest lower bound which is upper bounded by the highest upper bound with some insignificant difference is found as the global optimum. A convex maximization formulation of the optimization problem with a piecewise linearly outer approximated feasible region is essentially applied for finding an upper bound which only requires solving a linear program problem. The simulation results show a significant improvement in the sum rate of the proposed algorithm over the conventional suboptimal techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing power allocation in interference channels using D.C. programming","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05518788.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing power allocation in interference channels using D.C. programming","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518788/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453297","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing power allocation in interference channels using D.C. programming","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p360alshatri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050329S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5518788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5518794,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536304700"},{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Communications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37269898400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7525-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7523-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7524-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5518794","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Power system modeling","Base stations","Frequency conversion","Interchannel interference","Iterative algorithms","Remote sensing","Laboratories","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","integer programming","iterative methods","linear programming","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative power allocation","subcarrier allocation","weighted sum of the minimal user rates","WSMR","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","cellular OFDMA systems","resource allocation","coordinate ascent-based algorithm","convex optimization","duality-based numerical algorithm","mixed integer linear program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","resource allocation","cochannel interference mitigation","spectrum management"]}],"abstract":"We consider the resource allocation (RA) problem of maximizing the weighted sum of the minimal user rates (WSMR) of coordinated cells subject to a total power constraint at each base station (BS) in the downlink of a cellular orthogonal frequency division multi-access (OFDMA) system.

Based on previous works for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, we propose a novel interference reducing self-organizing coordination scheme for a multi antenna OFDM system with space division multiple access (SDMA). The proposed Virtual Subband Algorithm (VSA) tries to maximize the overall network utility by adjusting transmit powers on a per beam granularity and leads to a soft fractional frequency reuse. It uses only small additional information exchange between sectors and infrequent additional long-term feedback. Although reducing interference, VSA follows a completely new approach by having all beams switched-on all the time. Simulations show that in static settings compared to a non-cooperative, highly opportunistic, greedy scheduling scheme, VSA achieves significant gains both in the performance of cell-edge users and in the overall system performance, defined in this paper as the geometric average of user throughputs. Moreover it is shown that cell-edge users benefit even in fast-fading cases, although a gain in system-wide performance cannot be guaranteed.","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05518797.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing distributed inter-cell beam coordination in cellular networks with best effort traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing distributed inter-cell beam coordination in cellular networks with best effort traffic","htmlLink":"/document/5518797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11453254","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing distributed inter-cell beam coordination in cellular networks with best effort traffic","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p295wunder.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049614S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5518797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5518798,"authors":[{"name":"Yalin Evren Sagduyu","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation Inc, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Yalin Evren","lastName":"Sagduyu","id":"37265759700"},{"name":"Randall A.

For random access over collision channels, the jamming problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game in which nodes choose their transmission probabilities under energy and delay constraints. We relax the standard assumption of backlogged nodes and evaluate the Nash equilibrium strategies for random arrivals, which introduces the possibility that jamming attacks fail due to empty packet queues at the transmitters. The maximum feasible throughput is derived depending on whether jammers have the queue state knowledge, or not. We also model the effects of erroneous queue state inference due to random packet traffic and incorporate the channel sensing capability before jamming. The analysis extends from one transmitter-jammer pair transmitting over a single channel at a single access point to multiple transmitters and jammers, and then to an arbitrary number of subchannels at multiple channel access points. In the resulting jamming games, we show that jammers cannot effectively increase the average energy cost and cannot decrease the feasible throughput for transmitters, if they face uncertainty on transmitter queue states. Therefore, medium access is less vulnerable to jamming attacks under increasing traffic uncertainty. This motivates the use of traffic dynamics as a defense mechanism to mitigate denial of service attacks in wireless access.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05518798.pdf","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless jamming attacks under dynamic traffic uncertainty","startPage":"303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Wireless jamming attacks under dynamic traffic uncertainty","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518798/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11453255","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5518798/","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless jamming attacks under dynamic traffic uncertainty","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p303sagduyu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093571S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5518798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5518802,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Ghaffar","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Ghaffar","id":"37392200900"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","affiliation":["Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp","id":"37283390500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7525-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7523-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7524-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5518802","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":877},"abstract":"The downlink performance of cellular networks is known to be strongly limited by inter-cell interference. In order to mitigate this interference, a number of frequency reuse schemes have recently been proposed. This paper discusses a novel fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme combined with interference suppression for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks, which are currently being considered in LTE-A and WiMAX IEEE 802.16m standardization processes. We confine to the case of cell edge users and show that the novel FFR scheme improves the spectral efficiency by allowing one out-of-cell interference. Then the proposed subcarrier and rate allocation ensures interference exploitation by the mobile station (MS) which results in the reduction of power consumption at the base stations (BSs). Interestingly no inter-cell interference coordination but only a priori frequency planning is required in the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05518802.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5518802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional frequency reuse and interference suppression for OFDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Disruption tolerant networking","Relays","Humans","Joining processes","Monitoring","Probability distribution","Protocols","Length measurement","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional frequency reuse","interference suppression","OFDMA networks","cellular networks","intercell interference","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","a priori frequency planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5518802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fractional frequency reuse and interference suppression for OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5518802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453264","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional frequency reuse and interference suppression for OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p273ghaffar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065391S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5518802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5518816,"authors":[{"name":"Mariana Dirani","affiliation":["Altran, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mariana","lastName":"Dirani","id":"37296962600"},{"name":"Zwi Altman","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Zwi","lastName":"Altman","id":"37265512200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7525-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7523-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7524-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5518816","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Interference","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Resource management","System performance","Downlink","Cellular networks","WiMAX","Self-organizing networks","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","learning (artificial intelligence)","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative reinforcement learning","inter-cell interference coordination","OFDMA cellular networks","key radio resource management mechanism","4G networks","LTE","WiMAX","self-organizing networks","cooperative MultiAgent control problem","fuzzy inference system","fuzzy Q-learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inter-Cell Interference Coordination","OFDMA","LTE","Reinforcement Learning","Fuzzy Q-Learning","SON"]}],"abstract":"Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) is commonly identified as a key radio resource management mechanism to enhance system performance of 4G networks.

The problem is posed as a cooperative MultiAgent control problem. Each base station is an agent that dynamically changes power masks on a subset of its bandwidth to control interference it produces to its neighbouring cells. The agent learns the optimal coordinated power allocation strategy using information from its own and its neighbouring cells.

Some of the outcomes of a project in which we have developed a metal enclosed converter station are presented in the paper. Thyristor valves, metal oxide surge arresters, DCCT, PT's, switchgears, connecting-buses, and other components in a converter station have been developed. All of these equipment have been subjected to a long term voltage endurance test at 1.3 pu of their rated voltage at \u00b1125 kV. A control and protection system has also been developed. Fundamental control function has been digitalized to secure reliability, accuracy and flexibility of the dc plant control. A 9.6 MW back-to-back miniplant rated at 16 kV, 600 A has been constructed to gain an operational experience of the new gas insulated converter station. In spite of the rated voltage of the system, all the equipment in the system is rated at 125 kV line to ground voltage and stressed at the voltage using a separate dc bias voltage source. Based on the experiences obtained in the project, a conceptional design of a \u00b1500 kV 5 GW converter station will also be discussed. Technical feasibility and benefits of introducing the gas insulation, metal oxide dc arresters and digitalized control have been investigated through the development of the full scale dc equipment rated at 125 kV and a 9.6 MW back-to-back miniplant which is fully gas insulated and controlled by the digitalized scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","pdfPath":"/iel5/39/5519248/05519275.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","doi":"10.1109/MPER.1983.5519275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPER.1983.5519275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5519248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5519275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Approach to SF<inf>6</inf> Gas Insulated HVDC Converter Station","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Gas insulation","Arresters","Digital control","HVDC transmission","Thyristors","Valves","Surge protection","Switching converters","Testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5519275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","displayDocTitle":"New Approach to SF<inf>6</inf> Gas Insulated HVDC Converter Station","volume":"PER-3","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Approach to SF<inf>6</inf> Gas Insulated HVDC Converter Station","sourcePdf":"PER-vPER-3-n9-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066436S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"5519248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5519275","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5519373,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In such a network, where licensed/primary users (who has the right to use the spectrum) and the unlicensed/secondary users coexist, a secondary spectrum market can be established where the primary network service provider charges the secondary users for the usage of the spectrum, while the secondary users also compete with each other for the access. Several important questions arise regarding the operation of such spectrum market: 1) how the spectrum should be priced; 2) how the secondary users should distributedly access the spectrum based on the spectrum price. To answer these questions, we interpret the available spectrum in the network as the aggregated interference tolerable at the receivers of the primary users, and introduce the notion of a market equilibrium in which the prices of the spectrum/interference are set correctly such that 1) the supply of the spectrum equals the demand of the spectrum, and 2) the secondary network is stable. We also developed an algorithm to distributedly compute such market equilibrium, and proved its convergence.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","startPage":"40","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05519528.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive sharing of the spectrum in cognitive radio network: A market equilibrium framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5519528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5519528/","displayDocTitle":"Competitive sharing of the spectrum in cognitive radio network: A market equilibrium framework","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453283","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive sharing of the spectrum in cognitive radio network: A market equilibrium framework","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p40hong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07786S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5519528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5519533,"authors":[{"name":"Dileep M.

However, a fundamental question arises: Why would licensed primary users of a spectrum band allow secondary users to share the band and degrade performance for them? This incentive issue has been sought to be addressed by designing incentive-compatible auction mechanisms. This, however, does not solve the problem as the auctioneer (usually the primary user) is also an interested party. So, why would the secondary user trust the primary user to not manipulate the auction. We propose that a more appropriate mechanism to solve this incentive problem is a contractual mechanism. In this paper, we consider a simple setting: A single primary transmitter-receiver pair and a single secondary transmitter-receiver pair with a Gaussian interference channel between them. We consider the setting of complete information when channel attenuation coefficients and noise levels at the receivers are common knowledge. We consider when receivers cooperate to do successive-interference cancellation. In contrast to the results of for unlicensed bands, we show that it is possible to achieve socially optimal rate allocations with contract mechanisms in licensed bands.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5519533/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11453284","publicationDate":"May 2010","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5519533/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A contracts-based approach for spectrum sharing among cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contracts-based approach for spectrum sharing among cognitive radios","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p91kalathil.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086536S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5519533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5519534,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Combes","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Combes","id":"37541753200"},{"name":"Zwi Altman","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Zwi","lastName":"Altman","id":"37265512200"},{"name":"Eitan Altman","affiliation":["I.N.R.I.A.

We then propose a coverage-capacity self-optimization scheme based on \u03b1-fair schedulers. The method uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to calculate the optimal \u03b1 in both simple and efficient manner.

Primary users have a license to operate in a certain spectrum band; their access can only be controlled by the Primary Operator and is not affected by any other unlicensed (secondary) user. On the other hand, secondary users (SUs) have no spectrum license, and they attempt to exploit the spectral gaps left free by primary users. This work studies the spectrum access problem in cognitive radio networks from a game theoretical perspective. The problem is modeled as a non-cooperative spectrum access game where secondary users access simultaneously multiple spectrum bands left available by primary users, optimizing their objective function which takes into account the congestion level observed on the available spectrum bands. As a key innovative feature with respect to existing works, we model accurately the interference between SUs, capturing the effect of spatial reuse. We demonstrate the existence of the Nash equilibrium, and derive equilibrium flow settings. Finally, we provide numerical results of the proposed spectrum access game in several cognitive radio scenarios, and study the impact of the interference between SUs on the game efficiency. Our results indicate that the congestion cost functions we propose in this paper lead to small gaps between Nash equilibria and optimal solutions in all the considered network scenarios, thus representing a starting point for designing pricing mechanisms so as to obtain a socially optimal use of the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05519538.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive interference-aware spectrum access in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5519538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","displayDocTitle":"Competitive interference-aware spectrum access in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5519538/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5519538/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11453288","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive interference-aware spectrum access in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p85elias.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101908S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5509122","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5518781","articleId":"5519538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INRIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5519540,"authors":[{"name":"Nikola Vucic","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Vucic","id":"37541775900"},{"name":"Shuying Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Shuying","lastName":"Shi","id":"37291460500"},{"name":"Martin Schubert","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications (MCI), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37265056000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7525-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7523-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7524-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5519540","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":752},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5519540","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless networks","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Broadcasting","Mobile communication","Iterative algorithms","Power control","Signal mapping","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","convex programming","interference (signal)","iterative methods","mobile communication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC programming approach","wireless networks","sum rate maximization","joint resource allocation","interference mitigation","multiantenna processing","signal-to-interference-plus-noise expressions","matrix-based functions","concave interference functions","convex functions","iterative algorithm","NP-hard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC programming","interference mitigation","multiantenna systems","resource management","power control"]}],"endPage":"386","startPage":"380","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5509122/5518781/05519540.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC programming approach for resource allocation in wireless networks","abstract":"We consider the problem of sum rate maximization with joint resource allocation and interference mitigation by multiantenna processing in wireless networks.

It is also very efficient and rather general in terms of allowing interesting extensions, compared with the related results from the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5519540/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11453290","conferenceDate":"31 May-4 June 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DC programming approach for resource allocation in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC programming approach for resource allocation in wireless networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p380vucic.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0534S","chronDate":"May 31 2010-June 4 2010","isNumber":"5518781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5509122","citationCount":"13","articleId":"5519540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5519581,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Giorsetto","affiliation":["Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Giorsetto","id":"37299239000"},{"name":"Kent F.
