If G is an arbitrary factor graph with N nodes, its r-dimensional product contains N/sup r/ nodes. Our algorithm sorts N/sup r/ keys stored in the r-dimensional product of G in O(r/sup r/F(N)) time, where F(N) depends on G. We show that, for any factor graph G, F(N) is, at most, O(N), establishing an upper bound of O(r/sup 2/ N) for the time complexity of sorting N/sup r/ keys on any product network. For product networks with bounded r(e.g. for grids), this leads to the asymptotic complexity of O(N) to sort N/sup r/ keys, which is optimal for several instances of product networks. There are factor graphs for which F(N)=O(log/sup 2/ N), which leads to the asymptotic running time of O(log/sup 2/ N) to sort N/sup r/ keys. For networks with bounded N (e.g. in the hypercube N=2, fixed), the asymptotic complexity becomes O(r/sup 2/). We show how to apply the algorithm to several cases of well-known product networks, as well as others introduced recently. We compare the performance of our algorithm to well-known algorithms developed specifically for these networks, as well as others. The result of these comparisons led us to conjecture that the proposed algorithm is probably the best deterministic algorithm that can be found in terms of the low asymptotic complexity with a small constant.","doi":"10.1109/71.640013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/13843/00640013.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.640013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13843","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized algorithm for parallel sorting on product networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized algorithm for parallel sorting on product networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5813856","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized algorithm for parallel sorting on product networks","sourcePdf":"00640013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050898S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"13843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","articleId":"640013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":640018,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Fang Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Liang-Fang Chao","id":"37300634900"},{"name":"E.

Over the past two years a study has been in progress by Virginia Tech and COMSAT Labs on the effects of multipath fading at L-band. A 1.537 GHz pilot tone from the INMARSAT II F-4 geosynchronous satellite at 55 degrees W was used as a source for long term signal level measurements with a fixed position receiver. The receive antenna was right-hand circularly polarized with hemispherical coverage. Multipath fading in excess of 10 dB was observed on numerous occasions. Since margins for the proposed handheld satcom systems are much less than 10 dB fading to this level will cause severe link degradation. The most practical solution to the problem is replacement of the conventional omnidirectional antenna with an adaptive array. Experiments at Virginia Tech have been undertaken to determine the feasibility of a multielement small scale diversity antenna for use in combating multipath fading. These studies have shown that a simple four element bi-planar patch array can produce a significant improvement in link reliability over an omnidirectional antenna. Not only was the average signal level improved by 3 to 4 dB, but the maximum fade depth was also reduced from 10 dB or more to under 3 dB. This paper describes the VA Tech experiments and presents some of the preliminary results.","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Ninth International Conference on Antennas and Propagation, ICAP '95 (Conf.

Before inserting the new hidden neuron into the network, only the weights connecting the new hidden neuron to the other neurons are trained (i.e. updated) until there is no significant reduction of the output error. To generate a fault tolerant network, the relevance of synaptic weights is estimated in each cycle.

The common solution to this problem is the use of tapped delay line filters in each spatial channel to facilitate space-time adaptive processing (STAP). The higher performance provided by the STAP architecture comes at the cost of a considerable increase in complexity. This paper presents a simpler technique based on programmable time adjustable sampling (TAS) that provides a limited number of wideband degrees of freedom. Two TAS methods are introduced: TAS-sidelobe canceler (TAS-SLC) is based on the sidelobe canceler, while TAS-minimum variance beamformer (TAS-MVB) is derived from the minimum variance beamformer. TAS is implemented by adjusting the sampling instant at selected array channels. TAS-SLC consists of controlling the sampling in the main channel of the sidelobe canceler With TAS-MVB array complex weights are substituted with TAS time delays. The performance of TAS methods with wideband interference is compared to the conventional sidelobe canceler and minimum variance beamformers. It is shown that TAS-SLC provides better performance than the sidelobe canceler, while TAS-MVB outperforms the minimum variance beamformer.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Interference cancellation","Sampling methods","Adaptive arrays","Narrowband","Interference suppression","Delay lines","Adaptive filters","Costs","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","adaptive signal processing","interference suppression","signal sampling","radar signal processing","radar interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband interference cancellation","adaptive array","complex spatial weights","tapped delay line filters","spatial channel","space-time adaptive processing","STAP architecture","complexity","programmable time adjustable sampling","TAS-sidelobe canceler","TAS-minimum variance beamformer","TAS-MVB array complex weights","TAS time delays","performance","wideband interference","minimum variance beamformer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/7.640256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/13863/00640256.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.640256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sampling-based approach to wideband interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sampling-based approach to wideband interference cancellation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640256/","volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5812107","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sampling-based approach to wideband interference cancellation","sourcePdf":"00640256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031321S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"13863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"5","articleId":"640256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":640260,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Direct identification of the constant-acceleration trajectory model from the Doppler signal requires a 9-dimensional nonlinear optimization. Exploiting symmetry in the sensing geometry, a novel trajectory representation is presented which reduces the nonlinear optimization to one in 3 dimensions, with additional parameters obtained by linear identification.

The phase-only perturbation techniques eliminate the need for element level receivers and support low cost retrofitting of adaptive nulling on phased arrays by using conventional beamsteering circuits to apply the adaptive weights.","doi":"10.1109/7.640274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/13863/00640274.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.640274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"169","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-only LMS and perturbation adaptive algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Phase-only LMS and perturbation adaptive algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640274/","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5818821","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-only LMS and perturbation adaptive algorithms","sourcePdf":"00640274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029971S","chronDate":"Jan 1998","isNumber":"13863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"23","articleId":"640274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":640280,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Faa-Jeng Lin","id":"37086996997"},{"name":"Ho-Ming Su","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ho-Ming Su","id":"37087288470"},{"name":"Hong-Pong Chen","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Pong Chen","id":"37087290237"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"640280","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640280","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Servomechanisms","Rotors","Neural networks","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Real time systems","Adaptive systems","State estimation","Character generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["servomotors","rotors","induction motor drives","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers","digital simulation","circuit analysis computing","computerised control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor servo drive","adaptive rotor","time-constant estimation","indirect filed-oriented induction motor","on-line trained neural network controller","rotor time-constant","real-time","model reference adaptive system","linear model-following controller","estimated plant model","state responses","reference model","augmented signal","neural network controller","model-following error","model-following characteristic","Pentium computer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/7.640280","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/13863/00640280.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"224","endPage":"234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.640280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Induction motor servo drive with adaptive rotor time-constant estimation","abstract":"An indirect filed-oriented induction motor (IM) position servo drive with adaptive rotor time-constant estimation and an on-line trained neural network controller is presented.

Within ACTS the project FRAMES (Future Radio Wideband Multiple Access System) has been set up with an objective to define a proposal for a UMTS radio access system. During the first project year, an assessment of several multiple access schemes against UMTS criteria has been carried out within the FRAMES project. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, a harmonized multiple access platform has been designed consisting of two modes: FMA1, a wideband TDMA with and without spreading and FMA2, a wideband CDMA. In general, both FMA1 and FMA2 can fulfil the UMTS objectives and form the FRAMES input into UMTS standardization. However, FMA1 seems more suitable for bursty types of traffic and in addition to FDD also for asymmetric TDD operation while FMA2 is better suited for moderately varying circuit switched data in public radio environments. The paper describes the FMA concept, the FMA1 frame and burst structure and the service mapping. The joint detection aspects are examined together with the FMA2 frame structure and interfrequency handover.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19970709","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on CDMA Techniques and Applications for Third Generation Mobile Systems (Digest No: 1997/129)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on CDMA Techniques and Applications for Third Generation Mobile Systems (Digest No: 1997/129)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5082/13871/00640351.pdf","startPage":"7/1","endPage":"7/8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19970709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FRAMES multiple access for UTMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"19 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640351/","displayDocTitle":"FRAMES multiple access for UTMS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5630058","conferenceDate":"19-19 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FRAMES multiple access for UTMS","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00640351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024012S","chronDate":"19 May 1997","isNumber":"13871","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5082","citationCount":"15","articleId":"640351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":640617,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Chieh Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan","AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Shih-Chieh Chang","id":"37281063400"},{"name":"Kwang-Ting Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Kwang-Ting Cheng","id":"37275533100"},{"name":"Nam-Sung Woo","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Nam-Sung Woo","id":"37265741200"},{"name":"M.

The approach attempts to identify alternative wires and alternative functions for wires that cannot be routed due to the limited routing resources in FPGA. The alternative wires (in the logic level) that can be routed through less congested areas substitute the unroutable wires without changing the circuit's functionality. Allowing the logic blocks to have alternative functions also increases the chance of successful routing. A redundancy addition and removal technique is used to identify such alternative wires. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. For a set of randomly selected benchmark circuits, on the average, 30-50% of wires have alternative wires. These results indicate that the routing flexibility can be substantially increased by considering these alternative wires. Our prototype system successfully completed routing for two AT&T designs that cannot be handled by an FPGA router alone. The proposed synthesis technique can also be applied to standard cell and gate array designs to reduce the routing area.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00640617.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/13908/00640617.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.640617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.640617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Postlayout logic restructuring using alternative wires","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Routing","Logic circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Programmable logic arrays","Circuit synthesis","Circuit topology","Prototypes","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","integrated circuit layout","network routing","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["postlayout logic restructuring","alternative wire","layout-driven synthesis","field programmable gate array","alternative function","redundancy","FPGA routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Postlayout logic restructuring using alternative wires","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5762353","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Postlayout logic restructuring using alternative wires","sourcePdf":"00640617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039322S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"39","articleId":"640617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":640619,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, traditional FPGA-based logic emulators have poor inter-chip communication bandwidth, commonly limiting gate utilization to less than 20%. Global routing contention mandates the use of expensive crossbar and PC-board technology in a system of otherwise low-cost commodity parts. Even with crossbar technology, current emulators only use a fraction of potential communication bandwidth because they dedicate each FPGA pin (physical wire) to a single emulated signal (logical wire). Virtual wires overcome pin limitations by intelligently multiplexing each physical wire among multiple logical wires, and pipelining these connections at the maximum clocking frequency of the FPGA. The resulting increase in bandwidth allows effective use of low-dimension direct interconnect. The size of the FPGA array can be decreased as well, resulting in low-cost logic emulation. This paper covers major contributions of the MIT Virtual Wires project. In the context of a complete emulation system, we analyze phase-based static scheduling and routing algorithms, present virtual wires synthesis methodologies, and overview an operational prototype with 20 K-gate boards. Results, including in-circuit emulation of a SPARC microprocessor, indicate that virtual wires eliminate the need for expensive crossbar technology while increasing FPGA utilization beyond 45%. Theoretical analysis predicts that virtual wires emulation scales with FPGA size and average routing distance, while traditional emulation does not.","doi":"10.1109/43.640619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/13908/00640619.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.640619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13908","startPage":"609","endPage":"626","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00640619.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic emulation with virtual wires","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Logic emulation with virtual wires","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5762355","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic emulation with virtual wires","sourcePdf":"00640619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077328S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"98","articleId":"640619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":640624,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

It is used to measure the spatial variation of the EO coefficient in x-cut lithium niobate caused by the annealed proton exchange technique. The lithium niobate samples are proton exchanged at different temperatures for varying times. The measurements presented indicate significant degradation of the EO coefficient immediately after the proton exchange process. The samples are annealed at 375/spl deg/C to enable recovery of the EO coefficient. Samples processed in benzoic acid for 30 min at a temperature of 240/spl deg/C show immediate recovery of the EO coefficient upon thermal annealing. Samples processed in benzoic acid for 5 h at a temperature of 180/spl deg/C show a slower recovery of the EO coefficients requiring longer periods of thermal annealing even though the diffusion depth is the same as in the previous case. Samples processed in benzoic acid for 5 h at a temperature of 240/spl deg/C exhibit significant cracking which worsens progressively upon thermal annealing. The EO coefficient cannot be restored in all areas even after a long 8-h anneal step.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protons","Annealing","Lithium niobate","Electrooptical waveguides","Optical waveguides","Temperature","Optical films","Optical interferometry","Optical modulation","Electromagnetic waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium compounds","optical materials","electro-optical devices","ion exchange","annealing","diffusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrooptic coefficient variation","proton exchanged","annealed lithium niobate samples","spatial variation","EO coefficient","x-cut lithium niobate","annealed proton exchange technique","varying times","proton exchange process","benzoic acid","immediate recovery","thermal annealing","diffusion depth","cracking","anneal step","375 C","30 min","5 h","180 C","8 h","LiNbO/sub 3/"]}],"doi":"10.1109/2944.640634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/13897/00640634.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.640634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrooptic coefficient variation in proton exchanged and annealed lithium niobate samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrooptic coefficient variation in proton exchanged and annealed lithium niobate samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640634/","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5754779","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrooptic coefficient variation in proton exchanged and annealed lithium niobate samples","sourcePdf":"00640634.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037879S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"6","articleId":"640634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":640635,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It includes: 1) theoretical consideration on the effects; 2) processing techniques for semiconductor microcavities; and 3) some demonstrations of photonic crystal and microdisk cavity. It was shown that, even with a spectral broadening of electron transition, thresholdless lasing operation and alternation of spontaneous emission rate are expected in a cavity satisfying the single mode condition that only one mode is allowed in the transition spectrum. An ideal three-dimensional (3-D) photonic crystal has the potentiality for realizing this condition. In two-dimensional (2-D) crystals and microdisk cavities, thresholdless operation is also expected, but the alternation of spontaneous emission rate may be negligible due to the insufficient optical confinement. In the experiment, some processing techniques for GaInAsP-InP system were investigated and methane-based reactive ion beam etching was selected because of the smooth sidewalls and adaptability to arbitrary structures. A GaInAsP-InP 2-D photonic crystal constructed by submicron columns was fabricated using this method. Owing to the slow surface recombination of this material, a polarized photoluminescence and peculiar transmission spectra were observed at room temperature (RT), which can be explained by a photonic band calculation. However, some technical improvement is necessary for clear demonstration of photonic bandgap, which is minimally required for device applications. In contrast to this, a GaInAsP-InP microdisk cavity of 2 /spl mu/m in diameter, which corresponds to the cavity volume 2.5 times the single-mode condition, has achieved RT lasing with threshold current as low as 0.2 mA. Further reduction of diameter and realization of continuous-wave (CW) operation will provide a significant regime for the observation of spontaneous emission control effects.","doi":"10.1109/2944.640635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/13897/00640635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.640635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13897","startPage":"808","endPage":"830","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00640635.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic crystals and microdisk cavities based on GaInAsP-InP system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Photonic crystals and microdisk cavities based on GaInAsP-InP system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5754780","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic crystals and microdisk cavities based on GaInAsP-InP system","sourcePdf":"00640635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098003S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"183","articleId":"640635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":640642,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

A low-threshold high-efficiency and stable single-longitudinal-mode operation is obtained when the electrodes of the bent DFB waveguide were uniformly pumped. In a normal configuration where the modulator part is used as an intensity modulator (i.e., AR coating on the modulator side and HR coating on the DFB side), stable single longitudinal mode output power close to 40 mW in free space is obtained with a 0-V bias to the modulator and an extinction ratio of up to 15 dB at 2.5 V. This single mode stability is due to the continuously distributed phase shift implemented in the structure thus reducing the photon pile-up inside the laser cavity as compared to an abruptly quarter-wave phase shifted DFB laser. With a nonuniform injection in the multiple electrodes, it was possible to select one particular single longitudinal mode out of the three neighboring modes inside the broad reflection band of the reflector. A wavelength tuning range of about 3.5 nm was obtained while maintaining an optical output power of more than 2 dBm from each mode. The device has a very low chirp (0.01-nm peak-to-peak) when modulated with a 2.5 Gb/s pseudorandom binary sequence (PRES) data stream and an error-free transmission over 200 km of non-DSF fiber has been demonstrated for all four wavelength channels separated by 100-GHz spacing. Also, when the modulator part of the structure is used as a phase tuning element (i.e., antireflective (AR) coating on the DFB side and HR coating on the modulator side), we have successfully demonstrated high-speed optical packet switching with a fast and wide tunable wavelength range. The optical packets can be modulated at 2.5 Gb/s and may be switched among four wavelength channels in less than one bit period.","doi":"10.1109/2944.640650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"960","endPage":"967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/13897/00640650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.640650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broad-band tunable electroabsorption modulated laser for WDM application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunable circuits and devices","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical modulation","Continuous phase modulation","Intensity modulation","Coatings","Laser tuning","Optical packet switching","Pump lasers","Waveguide lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","electroabsorption","electro-optical modulation","waveguide lasers","distributed feedback lasers","semiconductor lasers","laser tuning","antireflection coatings","optical films","laser modes","integrated optoelectronics","optical pumping","bending","laser cavity resonators","wavelength division multiplexing","packet switching","optical communication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broad-band tunable electroabsorption modulated laser","WDM application","wavelength tunable electroabsorption modulated laser","bent waveguide DFB laser","distributed-feedback laser","low-threshold high-efficiency operation","low-threshold high-efficiency","stable single-longitudinal-mode operation","electrodes","bent DFB waveguide","uniformly pumped","normal configuration","intensity modulator","AR coating","HR coating","DFB side","stable single longitudinal mode output power","free space","extinction ratio","single mode stability","continuously distributed phase shift","photon pile-up","1.55 mum","40 mW","0 V","2.5 V","2.5 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Broad-band tunable electroabsorption modulated laser for WDM application","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5754795","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640650/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broad-band tunable electroabsorption modulated laser for WDM application","sourcePdf":"00640650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062026S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"15","articleId":"640650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":640655,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Cell nuclei are selectively stained with monoclonal antibodies, such as the anti-estrogen receptor antibodies, which are widely applied as part of assessing patient prognosis in breast cancer. The detection system uses a receptive field filter to enhance negatively and positively stained cell nuclei and a squashing function to label each pixel value as belonging to the background or a nucleus. In this study, the detection system assessed all biopsies in an automated fashion. Detection and classification of individual nuclei as well as biopsy grading performance was shown to be promising as compared to that of two experts. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were measured to be 83% and 67.4%, respectively. One major advantage of BASS stems from the fact that the system simulates the assessment procedures routinely employed by human experts; thus it can be used as an additional independent expert. Moreover, the system allows the efficient accumulation of data from large numbers of nuclei in a short time span. Therefore, the potential for accurate quantitative assessments is increased and a platform for more standardized evaluations is provided.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4233.640655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13896","startPage":"128","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/13896/00640655.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided detection of breast cancer nuclei","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided detection of breast cancer nuclei","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5748145","pubMedId":"11020815","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided detection of breast cancer nuclei","sourcePdf":"00640655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041217S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"41","articleId":"640655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":640707,"authors":[{"name":"J.-J.

Unlike the existing preceding methods, such as the TH and trellis precodings, the new preceding (i) may be independent of the ISI channel; (ii) is linear and does not have to implement any modulo operation; (iii) gives the ideal FIR equalization at the receiver for any FIR ISI channel including spectral-null channels; (iv) expands the transmission bandwidth in a minimum amount. The precoding is built on non-maximally decimated multirate filterbanks. Based on multirate filterbank theory, we present a necessary and sufficient condition on an FIR ISI transfer function in terms of its zero set such that there is a linear FIR N/spl times/M precoder so that an ideal FIR equalizer exists, where the integers K and N are arbitrarily fixed. The condition is easy to check. As a consequence of the condition, for any given FIR ISI transfer function (not identically 0), there always exist such linear FIR precoders. Moreover, for almost all given FIR ISI transfer functions, there exist linear FIR precoders with size N/spl times/(N-1), i,e., the bandwidth is expanded by 1/N. In addition to the conditions on the ISI transfer functions, a method for the design of the linear FIR precoders and the ideal FIR equalizers is also given. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theory.","doi":"10.1109/78.640709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13829/00640709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.640709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13829","startPage":"2431","endPage":"2441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New precoding for intersymbol interference cancellation using nonmaximally decimated multirate filterbanks with ideal FIR equalizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New precoding for intersymbol interference cancellation using nonmaximally decimated multirate filterbanks with ideal FIR equalizers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5728514","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New precoding for intersymbol interference cancellation using nonmaximally decimated multirate filterbanks with ideal FIR equalizers","sourcePdf":"00640709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041374S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"111","articleId":"640709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":640712,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

Convergence speed decreases as we increase the norm of the initialization matrix.

These include dynamic node allocation based on the complexity of the function approximation task, guaranteed convergence, and the ability to handle noise in the training data. However, the PROBART network does not generalize very well to untrained data. In this paper, a modified PROBART is proposed to overcome this deficiency. This modification replaces the winner-take-all mode of prediction of the PROBART with a distributed mode of prediction. This distributed mode enables several neurons to cooperate during prediction and, thus, provides better generalization capabilities even in noisy conditions. Computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the modified PROBART neural network using three benchmark nonlinear function approximation tasks. The prediction accuracy of the modified PROBART network compares favorably to the PROBART, fuzzy ARTMAP, and ART-EMAP networks for all these tasks.","doi":"10.1109/78.640717","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00640717.png","startPage":"2533","endPage":"2550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.640717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13829","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13829/00640717.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and generalization of noisy mappings using a modified PROBART neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640717/","displayDocTitle":"Learning and generalization of noisy mappings using a modified PROBART neural network","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5728521","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and generalization of noisy mappings using a modified PROBART neural network","sourcePdf":"00640717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033734S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","articleId":"640717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":640720,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the proposed classifier, a left-to-right HMM module is used first to segment the observation sequence of every exemplar into a fixed number of states. Subsequently, all the frames belonging to the same state are replaced by one average frame. Thus, every exemplar, irrespective of its time-state variation, is transformed into a fixed number of frames, i.e., a static pattern. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural net is then used as the classifier for these time-normalized exemplars. Some experimental results using sonar biologic signals are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid integrated classifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13829/00640720.pdf","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.640720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.640720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=640720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated hybrid neural network and hidden Markov model classifier for sonar signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Sonar","Wavelet transforms","Multilayer perceptrons","Multi-layer neural network","Transient analysis","Frequency","Space technology","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sonar signal processing","hidden Markov models","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated hybrid neural network","hidden Markov model classifier","sonar signals","HMM/NN classifier","time normalization property","discriminative ability","observation sequence","frames","static pattern","multilayer perceptron","time-normalized exemplars","sonar biologic signals","hybrid integrated classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"An integrated hybrid neural network and hidden Markov model classifier for sonar signals","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5736286","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated hybrid neural network and hidden Markov model classifier for sonar signals","sourcePdf":"00640720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040119S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","articleId":"640720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":640722,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Hi Chang","affiliation":["Mobile Multimedia Section, Electron. & Telecommun.

The device provides an accurate characterization of the far-end echo path using only half-duplex near-end speech during conversational calls. The in-service nonintrusive systems of interest are usually based on a class of least-mean-square (LMS) digital adaptive filters (DAFs). The chaotic-based modulation regime exploits a logistic mapping to optimize the convergence rate of the model while preserving the signal bandwidth requirements. Experimental results show that uncoded speech is ineffective in driving the modeling device when noise-to-echo ratios exceed approximately -30 dB and thus invalidates live measurements. The chaotic modulation, however, increased the echo-to-noise ratio and allowed adaptation for far-end noise conditions exceeding 30 dBs higher than that of the uncoded case.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13829/00640729.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00640729.png","startPage":"2600","endPage":"2604","doi":"10.1109/78.640729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.640729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of echo path modeling with chaotic coded speech","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of echo path modeling with chaotic coded speech","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5728530","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of echo path modeling with chaotic coded speech","sourcePdf":"00640729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085034S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","articleId":"640729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":640731,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Many of these, procedures attempt to maximize the joint posterior distribution on the image scene. To implement these methods, approximations to the joint posterior densities are required, because the dependence of the Gibbs partition function on the hyperparameter values is unknown. Here, the authors use recent results in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate the relative values of Gibbs partition functions and using these values, sample from joint posterior distributions on image scenes. This allows for a fully Bayesian procedure which does not fix the hyperparameters at some estimated or specified value, but enables uncertainty about these values to be propagated through to the estimated intensities. The authors utilize realizations from the posterior distribution for determining credible regions for the intensity of the emission source. The authors consider two different Markov random field (MRF) models-the power model and a line-site model. As applications they estimate the posterior distribution of source intensities from computer simulated data as well as data collected from a physical single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) phantom.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Computed tomography","Layout","Image reconstruction","Monte Carlo methods","Image sampling","Uncertainty","Markov random fields","Application software","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","Bayes methods","parameter estimation","single photon emission computed tomography","Monte Carlo methods","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully Bayesian estimation","Gibbs hyperparameters","emission computed tomography data","image regularization","Gibbs prior models","joint posterior distribution maximization","estimated intensities","Markov random field models","computer simulated data","physical SPECT phantom","nuclear medicine","medical diagnostic imaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Bayes Theorem","Computer Simulation","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Markov Chains","Models, Statistical","Monte Carlo Method","Phantoms, Imaging","Tomography, Emission-Computed","Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"]}],"previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00640741.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.640741","startPage":"516","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/13907/00640741.pdf","doi":"10.1109/42.640741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Bayesian estimation of Gibbs hyperparameters for emission computed tomography data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Fully Bayesian estimation of Gibbs hyperparameters for emission computed tomography data","accessionNumber":"5762755","pubMedId":"9368107","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","volume":"16","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Bayesian estimation of Gibbs hyperparameters for emission computed tomography data","sourcePdf":"00640741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044671S","chronDate":"Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"72","articleId":"640741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":640743,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This approach requires dedicated hardware and increases the cost (and in some cases the scanning time) required to produce a clinical SPECT image. Furthermore, if short focal-length fan-beam collimators are used for transmission imaging, the projection data may be truncated, leading to errors in the attenuation coefficient map. Our goal is to obtain information about the attenuation distribution from only the measured emission data by exploiting the fact that only certain attenuation distributions are consistent with a given emission dataset. Ultimately this consistency information will either be used directly to compensate for attenuation or combined with the incomplete information from fan-beam transmission measurements to produce a more accurate attenuation coefficient map. In this manuscript the consistency conditions (which relate the measured SPECT data to the sinogram of the attenuation distribution) are used to find the uniform elliptical attenuation object which is most consistent with the measured emission data. This object is then used for attenuation correction during the reconstruction of the emission data. The method is tested using both simulated and experimentally acquired data from uniformly and nonuniformly attenuating objects. The results show that, for uniform elliptical attenuators, the consistency conditions of the SPECT data can be used to produce an accurate estimate of the attenuation map without performing any transmission measurements. The results also show that, in certain circumstances, the consistency conditions can prove useful for attenuation compensation with nonuniform attenuators.","doi":"10.1109/42.640743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical

duration of a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging scan can be reduced if the transmission scan of one patient which is used for emission correction can be synthesized by using the reference transmission scan of another patient. In this paper, we propose a new intersubjects PET emission scan registration method and PET transmission synthesis method by using the boundary information of the body or brain scan of the PET emission scans. The PET emission scans have poor image quality and different intensity statistics so that we preprocess the emission scans to have a similar histogram and then apply the point distribution model (PDM) to extract the contours of the emission scan. The extracted boundary contour of every slice is used to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) surface of the reference set and the target set. Our registration is 3-D surface-based which uses the normal flow method to find the correspondence vector field between two 3-D reconstructed surfaces. Since it is difficult to analyze internal organs using PET emission scan imaging without correction, we assume that the deformation of internal organ is homogeneous. With the corresponding vector field between the two emission scans and the transmission scan of the reference set, we can synthesize the transmission scan of the target set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/640744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1997","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5762758","pubMedId":"9368110","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional PET emission scan registration and transmission scan synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional PET emission scan registration and transmission scan synthesis","sourcePdf":"00640744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05271S","chronDate":"Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"5","articleId":"640744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":640755,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The proposed array architectures have a sampling rate that is higher than that of existing architectures. This is achieved by pipelining the computations in each processor. While the non-recursive filters are pipelined by placing latches in the feed-forward paths, the recursive filters are restructured to create additional delays in the feedback paths, and then pipelined using the delays as latches. The proposed sorting network-based architectures are highly pipelined, and consist of fewer compare-swap units than existing architectures. The reduction in the number of compare-swap units is achieved by processing multiple outputs at the same time, and also by using Batcher's odd-even merge sort. The latency of these networks is reduced by building them with sorting units which sort 2 elements (sort-2) as well as 3 elements (Sort-3) in 1 time unit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear filters","Computer architecture","Sorting","Pipeline processing","Filtering","Digital filters","Feedforward systems","Added delay","Feedback","Computer networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1992.641080","publicationTitle":"Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/5080/13869/00641080.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1992.641080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaitali Chakrabarti","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Chaitali Chakrabarti","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641080/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaitali Chakrabarti","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00641080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023337S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 1992","isNumber":"13869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5080","citationCount":"5","articleId":"641080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":641084,"authors":[{"name":"V.

One of the major problems in applying these tools to industrial-size systems is the huge memory-usage for the exploration of the state-space of a network (or product) of timed automata, as the model-checkers must keep information on not only the control structure of the automata but also the clock values specified by clock constraints. In this paper, we present a compact data structure for representing clock constraints. The data structure is based on an O(n/sup 3/) algorithm which, given a constraint system over real-valued variables consisting of bounds on differences, constructs an equivalent system with a minimal number of constraints. In addition, we have developed an on-the-fly, reduction technique to minimize the space-usage. Based on static analysis of the control structure of a network of timed automata, we are able to compute a set of symbolic states that cover all the dynamic loops of the network in an on-the-fly searching algorithm, and thus ensure termination in reachability analysis. The two techniques and their combination have been implemented in the tool UPPAAL. Our experimental results demonstrate that the techniques result in truly significant space-reductions: for six examples from the literature, the space saving is between 75% and 94%, and in (nearly) all examples time-performance is improved. Also noteworthy is the observation that the two techniques are completely orthogonal.","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1997.641265","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5099/13913/00641265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1997.641265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13913","startPage":"14","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient verification of real-time systems: compact data structure and state-space reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient verification of real-time systems: compact data structure and state-space reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641265/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795310","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient verification of real-time systems: compact data structure and state-space reduction","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00641265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045844S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","isNumber":"13913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5099","citationCount":"61","articleId":"641265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641271,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Adaptive fault tolerance (AFT) can assure adequate reliability of critical modules, under temporal and resource constraints, by allocating just as much redundancy to less critical modules as can be afforded thus gracefully reducing their resource requirement. We propose a mechanism for supporting adaptive fault tolerance in a real-time system. Adaptation is achieved by choosing a suitable redundancy strategy for a dynamically arriving computation to assure required reliability and to maximize the potential for fault tolerance while ensuring that deadlines are met. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-life workload simulating radar tracking software in AWACS early warning aircraft. The results demonstrate that our technique outperforms static fault tolerance strategies in terms of tasks meeting their timing constraints. Further, we show that the gain in this timing-centric performance metric does not reduce the fault tolerance of the executing task below a predefined minimum level. Overall, the evaluation indicates that the proposed ideas result in a system that dynamically provides QoS guarantees along the fault-tolerance dimension.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1997.641271","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/5099/13913/00641271.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"89","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1997.641271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fault tolerance and graceful degradation under dynamic hard real-time scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fault tolerance and graceful degradation under dynamic hard real-time scheduling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795316","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641271/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fault tolerance and graceful degradation under dynamic hard real-time scheduling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00641271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051497S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 1997","isNumber":"13913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5099","citationCount":"31","articleId":"641271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":641277,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Juen Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shao-Juen Ho","id":"37439703100"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tei-Wei Kuo","id":"37276775300"},{"name":"A.K.

The definition of similarity is combined with the idea of transaction skipping to provide a theoretical foundation for reducing the workload of a transaction system.

In large distributed systems such as those used in defense systems, on-demand service and inter-networked systems, applications contending for system resources must satisfy timing, reliability and security constraints as well as application-specific quality requirements. Allocating sufficient resources to different applications in order to satisfy various requirements is a fundamental problem in these situations. A basic yet flexible model for performance-driven resource allocations can therefore be useful in making appropriate tradeoffs. We present an analytical model for QoS management in systems which must satisfy application needs along multiple dimensions such as timeliness, reliable delivery schemes, cryptographic security and data quality. We refer to this model as Q-RAM (QoS-based Resource Allocation Model). The model assumes a system with multiple concurrent applications, each of which can operate at different levels of quality based on the system resources available to it. The goal of the model is to be able to allocate resources to the various applications such that the overall system utility is maximized under the constraint that each application can meet its minimum needs. We identify resource profiles of applications which allow such decisions to be made efficiently and in real-time. We also identify application utility functions along different dimensions which are composable to form unique application requirement profiles.

The extended scheme removes the following two restrictions of the scheme: real-time applications that are scheduled preemptively must consist solely of periodic tasks; and applications must not share global resources (i.e., resources used by more than one application).

The goal of such a hearing aid is to provide both the spatial-filtering benefits of the array and the natural benefits to sound localization and speech intelligibility that accrue from binaural listening. The present study examines two types of designs for fixed-processing systems: one in which independent arrays provide outputs to the two ears, and another in which the binaural outputs are derived from a single array. For the latter, various methods are used to merge array processing with binaural listening. In one approach, filters are designed to satisfy a frequency-dependent trade between directionality and binaural cue fidelity. In another, the microphone signals are filtered into low- and high-frequency components with the lowpass signals providing binaural cues and the highpass signal being the single output of the array processor. Acoustic and behavioral measurements were made in an anechoic chamber and in a moderately reverberant room to evaluate example systems. Theoretical performance was calculated for model arrays mounted on an idealized spherical head. Results show that both single- and dual-array systems provided target-intelligibility enhancements (2-4 dB improvements in speech reception threshold) relative to binaural cardioid microphones. In addition, the binaural-output systems provided cues that assist in sound localization, with resulting performance depending directly upon the cue fidelity. Finally, the sphere-based calculations accurately reflected the major features of the actual head-mounted array results, both in terms of directional sensitivity and output binaural cues.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.641298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13891","startPage":"529","endPage":"542","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/13891/00641298.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microphone-array hearing aids with binaural output .I.

The present study examines a design in which two ear-level omnidirectional microphones constitute the array. The merging of array processing with binaural listening is accomplished by dividing the frequency spectrum, devoting the lowpass part to binaural processing and the highpass part to adaptive array processing. Acoustic and behavioral measurements were made in an anechoic chamber and in a moderately reverberant room to assess the trade-off between sound localization and speech reception as the cutoff frequency was varied. A lowpass/highpass cutoff frequency of 500 Hz provided an improvement of 40 percentage points in sentence intelligibility over unaided listening for normal-hearing listeners, while still allowing adequate localization performance. Comparison of this binaural adaptive system to traditional amplification configurations with normal-hearing listeners showed improvements in speech reception in noise in a mildly reverberant room of approximately 3 dB over simple binaural amplification and 5 dB over monaural amplification.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.641299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13891","startPage":"543","endPage":"551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/13891/00641299.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microphone-array hearing aids with binaural output.

For amplifiers driven to yield the same unsaturated peak amplifier gain, positive linear chirp widens the spectral range of low-threshold switching and increases the switching contrast.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.641319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/3/13892/00641319.pdf","startPage":"2029","endPage":"2037","doi":"10.1109/3.641319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer-matrix analysis of optical bistability in DFB semiconductor laser amplifiers with nonuniform gratings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Transfer-matrix analysis of optical bistability in DFB semiconductor laser amplifiers with nonuniform gratings","volume":"33","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5756305","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641319/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer-matrix analysis of optical bistability in DFB semiconductor laser amplifiers with nonuniform gratings","sourcePdf":"00641319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044655S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"45","articleId":"641319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":641325,"authors":[{"name":"J.-L.

These structures exhibit high amplitude noise and the possible noise reduction is strongly reduced compared to Fabry-Perot structures. Distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers are better candidates even if their performances are also strictly determined by SHB and the loss in the Bragg reflector.

A 500-/spl mu/m cubic alexandrite crystal bound to the distal end of a 750-/spl mu/m-diameter optical fiber core and the Pt(TPP) coated circumferentially with a length of 1 cm from the end of the same fiber are excited with pulsed super-bright blue LED light. This apparatus uses a 125-kHz sampler for data acquisition and frequency domain methods for signal processing. The instrument amplifies both the dc and ac components of the photomultiplier output and band limits the signal to 20 kHz. The fundamental frequency of the excitation is set to 488.3 Hz and the highest harmonic used is the 35th. This bandlimited signal is sampled and averaged over a few hundred cycles in the time domain. The frequency domain representation of the data is obtained by employing fast Fourier transform algorithms. The phase delay and the modulation ratio of each sampled harmonic are then computed. At least four log-spaced harmonic phases or modulations are averaged before decoding the two lifetimes of temperature and oxygen phosphorescent sensors. A component of zero lifetime is introduced to account for the excitation backscatter leakage through optical interference filters seen by the photodetector. Linear and second-order empirical polynomials are employed to compute the temperatures and oxygen concentrations from the inverse lifetimes. In the situation of constant oxygen concentration, the lifetime of Pt(TPP) changes with temperature but can be compensated using the measured temperature lifetime. The system drift is 0.24/spl deg/C for the temperature measurement and 0.59% for the oxygen concentration measurement over 30 h of continuous operation. The instrumentation and methods allow for 6-s update times and 90-s full-response times.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","volume":"44","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5748346","pubMedId":"9353991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Real-time frequency domain temperature and oxygen sensor with a single optical fiber","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time frequency domain temperature and oxygen sensor with a single optical fiber","sourcePdf":"00641339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0538S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"21","articleId":"641339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641344,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We detail the design of the electron gun, which produces a moderately compressed axially streaming annular beam. The beam is velocity modulated by a short TM/sub 010/ coaxial input cavity and energy is extracted in a right-circular TE/sub 021/ output cavity. Perpendicular energy is imparted to the beam via a nonadiabatic magnetic transition at the end of a 23 cm drift region between the two cavities. A nonlinear single particle code is used to predict an electronic efficiency of 52% and a large signal gain of 25.5 dB. This code generates the cavity field profiles via a scattering matrix formalism and uses the output from the electron gun code to model the beam. This improved model allows the potentially important effects of leakage fields and finite beam thickness and spread to be investigated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.641375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13894/00641375.pdf","startPage":"2022","endPage":"2028","doi":"10.1109/16.641375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a low-voltage, axially modulated, cusp-injected, third harmonic, X-band gyrotron amplifier experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design of a low-voltage, axially modulated, cusp-injected, third harmonic, X-band gyrotron amplifier experiment","volume":"44","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5742134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a low-voltage, axially modulated, cusp-injected, third harmonic, X-band gyrotron amplifier experiment","sourcePdf":"00641375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051894S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","articleId":"641375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":641385,"authors":[{"name":"Gi-Tae Jeong","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gi-Tae Jeong","id":"37271104100"},{"name":"Kyu-Chan Lee","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyu-Chan Lee","id":"37337432500"},{"name":"Dae-Won Ha","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Won Ha","id":"37274924300"},{"name":"Kyu-Hyun Lee","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyu-Hyun Lee","id":"38182609000"},{"name":"Kyung-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung-Hoon Kim","id":"37616023200"},{"name":"Il-Gu Kim","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Il-Gu Kim","id":"38183987400"},{"name":"Do-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Do-Hyung Kim","id":"37291951500"},{"name":"Kinam Kim","affiliation":["Technology Development, Memory Device Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kinam Kim","id":"37280248100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"641385","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Isolation technology","DRAM chips","Leakage current","Capacitance","Low voltage","Circuits","Dielectric materials","Capacitors","Metallization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","CMOS memory circuits","leakage currents","capacitance","integrated circuit design","dielectric thin films","integrated circuit metallisation","integrated circuit measurement","isolation technology","circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance DRAM","giga-bit technologies","design rule","junction leakage current","junction capacitance","shallow trench isolation","access time","low operation voltage","TiSi/sub 2/ gate technique","sensing margin","operational stability","dielectric material","cell capacitor","depth of focus margin","triple metallization scheme","row address access time","chip size","CMOS","16 Mbit","0.18 mum","1.5 V","28 ns","TiSi/sub 2/","Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/","Al-W-Al"]}],"abstract":"An experimental high performance 16 Mb Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) having a 0.18 /spl mu/m design rule for gigabit DRAM's was developed.

The purpose of this work is that of investigating the anomalously-large leakage currents in poly-TFTs by numerical simulation, taking into account for the effects of energy distributed traps and field-enhanced generation mechanisms. The investigation is carried out both in steady-state and in transient conditions in accordance with the typical timing of the driving circuitry, and accounts for the kinetics of trapped carriers. Furthermore, the influence of material quality and device geometry is investigated. This study shows that the electric field increases by 30% during the off-transition with respect to steady-state. However, drain engineering using either LDD or active-gate structures allows for a substantial decrease of the peak electric-field value in dynamic conditions.","doi":"10.1109/16.641391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13894/00641391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.641391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13894","startPage":"2106","endPage":"2112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on anomalous leakage currents in poly-TFTs including dynamic effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on anomalous leakage currents in poly-TFTs including dynamic effects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5742150","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on anomalous leakage currents in poly-TFTs including dynamic effects","sourcePdf":"00641391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063832S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"12","articleId":"641391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":641394,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The main feature of our approach is that the detection of the faults occurs during transient periods of operation of the process. A two-stage neural network is proposed as the basic structure of the detection system. The first stage of the network detects the dynamic trend of each measurement, and the second stage of the network detects and diagnoses the faults. The potential of this approach is demonstrated in simulation using a model of a continuously well-stirred tank reactor. The neural-network-based method successfully detects and diagnoses pretrained faults during transient periods and can also generalize properly.

The control strategy consists essentially of two parts. The first part is an inner (stabilizing) control. Loop that incorporates a feedthrough term to assign the system's transmission zeros at desired locations in the complex plane, and a feedback term to move the system's poles to appropriate positions in the left-half plane. The second part is a feedback servo loop that allows tracking of the desired trajectory.

The machine exhibits a hysteresic nonlinearity in the desirable processing modes of operation. The experimental data characterize a testbed plasma etching process using Argon gas with control inputs including incident microwave power, pressure, and cavity size. The internal states and the outputs include reflected power, electric field, and ion density. We employ several tailored networks with novel learning algorithms derived from functions that include the polynomial and the exponential energy functions.

The method is based on a bottom-up segmentation algorithm that takes into consideration both color and texture properties of the image. An LUV gradient is introduced, which provides both a color similarity measure and a basis for applying the watershed transform. The patches of watershed mosaic are merged according to their color contrast until a termination criterion is met. This criterion is based on the topology of the typical processed image. The resulting algorithm does not require any additional information, be it various thresholds, marker extraction rules, and suchlike, thus being suitable for automatic processing of color images. The algorithm is demonstrated within the framework of the problem of automatic granite inspection. The segmentation procedure has been found to be very robust, producing good results not only on granite images, but on the wide range of other noisy color images as well, subject to the termination criterion.","doi":"10.1109/83.641413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13900/00641413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.641413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic watershed segmentation of randomly textured color images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Color","Humans","Filters","Topology","Data mining","Inspection","Robustness","Colored noise","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image segmentation","image texture","inspection","noise","random processes","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic watershed segmentation","randomly textured color images","image processing","bottom-up segmentation algorithm","LUV gradient","color similarity measure","watershed transform","watershed mosaic","color contrast","termination criterion","automatic granite inspection","granite images","noisy color images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Automatic watershed segmentation of randomly textured color images","volume":"6","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5743519","pubMedId":"18282911","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641413/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic watershed segmentation of randomly textured color images","sourcePdf":"00641413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029872S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"187","articleId":"641413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":641416,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Wah Wong","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ping Wah Wong","id":"37087164672"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"641416","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":75},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Frequency","Viterbi algorithm","Distortion measurement","Entropy","Image quality","Minimization methods","Delay","Optimization methods","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","entropy codes","minimisation","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy-constrained halftoning","multipath tree coding","optimization-based method","binary output pixel","mixture distortion criterion","frequency-weighted mean square error","MSE","minority pixels","ML-algorithm","distortion criterion minimisation","cost function","image quality","lossless compression","image coding"]}],"abstract":"We suggest an optimization-based method for halftoning that involves looking ahead before a decision for each binary output pixel is made.

A tree-coding approach with the ML-algorithm is used for minimizing the distortion criterion to generate a halftone.

However, a major weakness of neural modeling is the lack of established procedures for performing tests for misspecified models, and tests of statistical significance for the various parameters that have been estimated. This is a serious disadvantage in applications where there is a strong culture for testing not only the predictive power of a model or the sensitivity of the dependent variable to changes in the inputs but also the statistical significance of the finding at a specified level of confidence. Rarely is this more important than in the case of financial engineering, where the data generating processes are dominantly stochastic and only partially deterministic. Partly a tutorial, partly a review, this paper describes a collection of typical applications in options pricing, cointegration, the term structure of interest rates and models of investor behavior which highlight these weaknesses and propose and evaluate a number of solutions. We describe a number of alternative ways to deal with the problem of variable selection, show how to use model misspecification tests, we deploy a novel way based on cointegration to deal with the problem of nonstationarity, and generally describe approaches to predictive neural modeling which are more in tune with the requirements for modeling financial data series.","doi":"10.1109/72.641449","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13903/00641449.pdf","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.641449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in financial engineering: a study in methodology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in financial engineering: a study in methodology","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5764771","pubMedId":"18255728","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in financial engineering: a study in methodology","sourcePdf":"00641449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052426S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"105","articleId":"641449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":641451,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Shin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Chun-Shin Lin","id":"37087295312"},{"name":"Ching-Tsan Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Ching-Tsan Chiang","id":"37087349328"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"641451","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641451","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Least squares methods","Matrices","Neural networks","Quantization","Hypercubes","Digital arithmetic","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","learning (artificial intelligence)","convergence","matrix algebra","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning convergence","CMAC technique","convergence characteristics","hash mapping effects","memory size effects","error bound","information retrieval","learning rules","algebraic equations","matrix form"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.641451","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13903/00641451.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.641451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning convergence of CMAC technique","abstract":"CMAC is one useful learning technique that was developed two decades ago but yet lacks adequate theoretical foundation. Most past studies focused on development of algorithms, improvement of the CMAC structure, and applications. Given a learning problem, very little about the CMAC learning behavior such as the convergence characteristics, effects of hash mapping, effects of memory size, the error bound, etc. can be analyzed or predicted. In this paper, we describe the CMAC technique with mathematical formulation and use the formulation to study the CMAC convergence properties. Both information retrieval and learning rules are described by algebraic equations in matrix form. Convergence characteristics and learning behaviors for the CMAC with and without hash mapping are investigated with the use of these equations and eigenvalues of some derived matrices. The formulation and results provide a foundation for further investigation of this technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5764773","pubMedId":"18255730","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning convergence of CMAC technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning convergence of CMAC technique","sourcePdf":"00641451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035084S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"89","articleId":"641451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641452,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Myung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun Myung","id":"37087481581"},{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Hwan Kim","id":"37087151010"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"641452","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Constraint optimization","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Switches","System identification","Control systems","Linear programming","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying two-phase optimization","TVTP algorithm","neural-network learning","finite penalty parameter","constrained time-varying optimization","system identification","control","neo-fuzzy neuron model learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641452","abstract":"In this paper, a time-varying two-phase (TVTP) optimization neural network is proposed based on the two-phase neural network and the time-varying programming neural network.

A number of researchers have proposed fault diagnosis architectures for robotic manipulators using the model-based analytical redundancy approach. One of the key issues in the design of such fault diagnosis schemes is the effect of modeling uncertainties on their performance. This paper investigates the problem of fault diagnosis in rigid-link robotic manipulators with modeling uncertainties. A learning architecture with sigmoidal neural networks is used to monitor the robotic system for any off-nominal behavior due to faults. The robustness and stability properties of the fault diagnosis scheme are rigorously established.

Discrete-time Volterra models (DVMs) are often used in the study of nonlinear physical and physiological systems using stimulus-response data. However, their practical use has been hindered by computational limitations that confine them to low-order nonlinearities (i.e., only estimation of low-order kernels is practically feasible). Since three-layer perceptrons (TLPs) can be used to represent input-output nonlinear mappings of arbitrary order, this paper explores the basic relations between DVMs and TLPs with tapped-delay inputs in the context of nonlinear system modeling. A variant of TLP with polynomial activation functions-termed \"separable Volterra networks\" (SVNs)-is found particularly useful in deriving explicit relations with DVM and in obtaining practicable models of highly nonlinear systems from stimulus-response data. The conditions under which the two approaches yield equivalent representations of the input-output relation are explored, and the feasibility of DVM estimation via equivalent SVN training using backpropagation is demonstrated by computer-simulated examples and compared with results from the Laguerre expansion technique (LET). The use of SVN models allows practicable modeling of high-order nonlinear systems, thus removing the main practical limitation of the DVM approach.","doi":"10.1109/72.641465","startPage":"1421","endPage":"1433","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13903/00641465.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.641465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volterra models and three-layer perceptrons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multilayer perceptrons","Polynomials","Nonlinear systems","Kernel","Multi-layer neural network","Artificial neural networks","Biomedical engineering","Neural networks","Context modeling","Yield estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","transfer functions","polynomials","nonlinear systems","Volterra series","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-layer perceptrons","feedforward artificial neural networks","polynomial activation functions","discrete-time Volterra models","nonlinear physical systems","physiological systems","stimulus-response data","low-order nonlinearities","input-output nonlinear mappings","tapped-delay inputs","separable Volterra networks","backpropagation","Laguerre expansion technique","high-order Volterra systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Volterra models and three-layer perceptrons","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5764787","pubMedId":"18255744","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volterra models and three-layer perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00641465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023901S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"52","articleId":"641465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":641466,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The predictor consists of an adaptive linear element (Adaline) followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). An important but difficult problem in designing such a cascade predictor is to determine the complexity of the networks. We solve this problem by using the predictive minimum description length (PMDL) principle to select the optimal numbers of input and hidden nodes. This approach results in a predictor with both good noise attenuation and excellent generalization capability. The optimized neural networks are used for predictive filtering of very noisy Rayleigh fading signals with 1.8 GHz carrier frequency. Our results show that the optimal neural predictor can provide smoothed in-phase and quadrature signals with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of about 12 and 7 dB at the urban mobile speeds of 5 and 50 km/h, respectively. The corresponding power signal SNR gains are about 11 and 5 dB.

However, in many cases, the distribution of the individual results does not approximate a Gaussian distribution, may not be symmetric, and may be multimodal. We present the distribution of results for practical problems and show that assuming Gaussian distributions can significantly affect the interpretation of results, especially those of comparison studies. For a controlled task which we consider, we find that the distribution of performance is skewed toward better performance for smoother target functions and skewed toward worse performance for more complex target functions. We propose new guidelines for reporting performance which provide more information about the actual distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5764794","pubMedId":"18255751","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the distribution of performance from multiple neural-network trials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the distribution of performance from multiple neural-network trials","sourcePdf":"00641472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056146S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"27","articleId":"641472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":641473,"authors":[{"name":"C.

By using the concept of deflation, we are able to find sequential versions of these algorithms which extract the LDA components and generalized eigenvectors in a decreasing order of significance. Next, two new adaptive algorithms are described to compute the principal generalized eigenvectors of two matrices (as well as LDA) from two sequences of random matrices. We give a rigorous convergence analysis of our adaptive algorithms by using stochastic approximation theory, and prove that our algorithms converge with probability one.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13903/00641473.pdf","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.641473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.641473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing algorithms for generalized eigen-decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear discriminant analysis","Iterative algorithms","Adaptive algorithm","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Cost function","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","feature extraction","pattern classification","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","iterative methods","adaptive systems","approximation theory","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing algorithms","adaptive eigendecomposition","linear feedforward neural network","iterative algorithms","linear discriminant analysis","pattern classification","error cost function","linear heteroassociative network","feature extraction","eigenvectors","convergence analysis","stochastic approximation","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing algorithms for generalized eigen-decomposition","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5764795","pubMedId":"18255752","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing algorithms for generalized eigen-decomposition","sourcePdf":"00641473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049045S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","articleId":"641473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":641476,"authors":[{"name":"Jar-Shone Ker","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kao Yuan Junior College of Technology and Commerce, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jar-Shone Ker","id":"37087454888"},{"name":"Yau-Hwang Kuo","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yau-Hwang Kuo","id":"37087155697"},{"name":"Rong-Chang Wen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rong-Chang Wen","id":"37087454682"},{"name":"Bin-Da Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bin-Da Liu","id":"38257768900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"641476","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network has the advantages of fast convergence speed and low computation complexity.

The use of multivariate nested distributions allows estimation not only of correlation between various model parameters, but also allows each of those variations to be apportioned among the various stages of the process (i.e., wafer to wafer, lot to lot, etc.). This allows matched devices to be more accurately simulated, without having to develop customized models for each configuration of matching, and provides focus for process improvement efforts into those areas with the maximum potential reward.

An SVPWM control integrated circuit (IC) has been developed using state of-the-art field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. The proposed SVPWM control scheme can be realized using only a single FPGA (XC4010) from Xilinx, Inc. The output fundamental frequency can be adjusted from 0.094 to 1500 Hz. The pulse-width modulation (PWM) switching frequency can be set from 381 Hz to 48.84 kHz. The delay time for the PWM gating signals is adjustable.

The switching frequency of such controllers varies over the fundamental period of the modulating signal. The maximum switching frequency (MSF) of these controllers is high.

The incorporation of carrier lockouts causes current distortion, and load currents do not confine within the predetermined band. In this paper, two new controllers are proposed. One is a mixed-mode controller of sinusoidal band added to a fixed band, and the other is an equidistant-band current controller, performances of the proposed controllers are compared with the performances of the conventional fixed-band and sinusoidal-band controllers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Hysteresis","Voltage control","Switching frequency","Switches","Current control","Carrier confinement","Circuits","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","electric current control","switching circuits","AC motor drives","controllers","control system synthesis","microcomputer applications","computerised control","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-band hysteresis current controllers","PWM voltage-source inverters","fixed bands","switching frequency","maximum switching frequency","inverter switches limit","fixed carrier lockouts","current distortion","load currents","mixed-mode controller","sinusoidal band","fixed band","equidistant-band current controller","sinusoidal-band controllers","AC drives","microcomputer implementation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/63.641494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/63/13905/00641494.pdf","startPage":"964","endPage":"970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.641494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-band hysteresis current controllers for PWM voltage-source inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable-band hysteresis current controllers for PWM voltage-source inverters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641494/","volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5757211","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-band hysteresis current controllers for PWM voltage-source inverters","sourcePdf":"00641494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05266S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"85","articleId":"641494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":641495,"authors":[{"name":"Tsorng-Juu Liang","affiliation":["Kaohsiung Polytechnic Institute, Fengshan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsorng-Juu Liang","id":"37276172100"},{"name":"R.M.

By using the Walsh domain waveform analytic technique, the harmonic amplitudes of the inverter output voltage can be expressed as functions of switching angles.

The local piecewise linear relations between the switching angles and the fundamental amplitude can be obtained under an appropriate initial condition. By searching all feasible initial conditions, the global solutions are obtained. The relations between switching angles and fundamental amplitude can be approximated by straight-line curve fitting. Thus, on-line control of fundamental amplitude and frequency is possible for the microcomputer-based implementation. The developed algorithm can be applied to both bipolar and unipolar switching schemes.

This arrangement significantly improves the viability of SSIPP for practical applications. The auxiliary active-clamping transistor in the proposed circuit uses the same control/driver circuit as the main switching transistor.

This is a commendable goal but it is also fair to question whether this is an achievable goal. The fundamental problem is that as groundrules are reduced, the natural tendency is to make smaller conductor cross-sectional areas. The result is a high resistance line that exhibits slow wave propagation effects. This reduces the general performance expectations. As circuits become faster and denser on the chip, line delays become greater than expected. This problem is analyzed and potential chip and packaging solutions are offered. Clock rate predictions for various design and process options are made.

The model has been used to optimize the packages for robust design and to determine design rules to keep package warpage within acceptable limits. An L/sub 18/ Taguchi matrix has been developed to investigate the effect of die attach and encapsulant properties along with the substrate, encapsulant, die attach, and internal copper plane thicknesses on the reliability of the package during temperature cycling. For package failures, simulations performed represent temperature cycling from 165/spl deg/C to -65/spl deg/C. This condition is approximated by cooling the package mounted on a multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) from 165/spl deg/C to -65/spl deg/C. For coplanarity analysis, simulations have been performed without the PCB and the lowest temperature of the cycle is changed to 20/spl deg/C. Predicted results indicate that for an optimum design, that is low stress in the package and low package warpage, encapsulant as well as die attach material should have low Young's modulus and low coefficient of thermal expansion. Furthermore, it is found that the substrate and the die attach epoxy thicknesses should be increased beyond the current design. In addition to the optimization analysis, plastic strain distribution on each solder ball has been determined to predict the location of the possible first solder ball failure.","doi":"10.1109/96.641505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/13906/00641505.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.641505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of high pin count cavity-up enhanced plastic ball grid array (EPBGA) packages for robust design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of high pin count cavity-up enhanced plastic ball grid array (EPBGA) packages for robust design","volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5754526","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of high pin count cavity-up enhanced plastic ball grid array (EPBGA) packages for robust design","sourcePdf":"00641505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074298S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"20","articleId":"641505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641514,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Based on the density, surface tension, and volume of the solder material the effects of body forces are negligible compared to surface tension effects. For this case the predicted equilibrium shape of the molten solder is a truncated sphere, where the base of the sphere is defined by the bump input/output (I/O) pad on the integrated circuit (IC). Experiments using different size bumps on Si wafers were conducted to test the validity of the truncated sphere model. The experimental results matched the model to within 11% for the predicted height and 8% for the predicted radius. Using dimensionless variables for the solder volume, bump height, and bump radius allows these results for reflowed height and radius to each be plotted on a single curve and fitted with a single equation.

The probability density function of the total crosstalk is derived as function of the sum of the incoherent crosstalk contributions associated with the interfering signals, Because the total crosstalk level can be expected to vary only slowly as compared to the time duration of one bit, the probability p that the total crosstalk exceeds a maximum tolerable value is introduced as a parameter in the crosstalk and bit error rate analysis of optical networks. General computations show that the crosstalk requirement on optical network elements may be significantly relaxed if it can be accepted that it is possible, although most unlikely, that the total crosstalk may exceed this maximum tolerable value. The statistical crosstalk model is then illustrated by investigation of optical network examples with respect to their crosstalk and transmission properties, and, finally, compared with previous crosstalk models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5763088","volume":"15","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis of interferometric crosstalk: theory and optical network examples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis of interferometric crosstalk: theory and optical network examples","sourcePdf":"00641518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038998S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","articleId":"641518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":641522,"authors":[{"name":"P.O.

Each spherical code is recursively constructed from existing spherical codes in one lower dimension. Laminated spherical codes outperform the best known spherical codes in the minimum distance sense for many code sizes. The density of a laminated spherical code approaches the density of the laminated lattice in one lower dimension, as the minimum distance approaches zero. In particular, the three-dimensional laminated spherical code is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that its density approaches the Fejes Toth (1959) upper bound as the minimum distance approaches zero.

Such codes find applications in both channel coding for communication systems and in fault-tolerance support for signal processing subsystems. A new method for error correction based on optimum mean-square recursive Kalman estimation techniques incorporates time-varying models for the system and associated disruptive noise sources. The underlying common model for communications and fault tolerance applications assumes the system operates nominally with low levels of channel or numerical and roundoff noise, occasionally experiencing temporarily larger noise statistics. A time-varying Kalman estimation structure which uses single-step and fixed-lag smoothing predictors can correct errors to within the nominal low-noise levels. Correction actions may be activated only when larger activity is detected, so methods for detecting possible error situations are developed. However, misdetection is not a serious problem because the Kalman correction methods only track significant errors in the data. Two activity detection techniques are examined; one is based on likelihood ratio tests while another uses clipped samples and binary pattern matching. Several examples showing simulated mean-square error performance and decoded waveforms from error injection experiments are presented.","doi":"10.1109/18.641552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.641552","endPage":"1876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/13816/00641552.pdf","startPage":"1864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding real-number convolutional codes: change detection, Kalman estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641552/","displayDocTitle":"Decoding real-number convolutional codes: change detection, Kalman estimation","volume":"43","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5776990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding real-number convolutional codes: change detection, Kalman estimation","sourcePdf":"00641552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024916S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","articleId":"641552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641553,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A simple idealized linear (and planar) uplink, cellular, multiple-access communication model, where only adjacent cell interference is present and all signals may experience fading is considered. Shannon theoretic arguments are invoked to gain insight into the implications on performance of the main system parameters and multiple-access techniques. The model treated in Part I (Shamai, 1997) is extended here to account for cell-site receivers that may process also the received signal at an adjacent cell site, compromising thus between the advantage of incorporating additional information from other cell sites on one hand and the associated excess processing complexity on the other. Various settings which include fading, time-division multiple access (TDMA), wideband (WB), and (optimized) fractional inter-cell time sharing (ICTS) protocols are investigated and compared. In this case and for the WB approach and a large number of users per cell it is found, surprisingly, that fading may enhance performance in terms of Shannon theoretic achievable rates. The linear model is extended to account for general linear and planar configurations. The effect of a random number of users per cell is investigated and it is demonstrated that randomization is beneficial. Certain aspects of diversity as well as some features of TDMA and orthogonal code-division multiple access (CDMA) techniques in the presence of fading are studied in an isolated cell scenario.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multiaccess communication","Signal processing","Time division multiple access","Wideband","Access protocols","Multiple access interference","Performance gain","Time sharing computer systems","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","cellular radio","diversity reception","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","information theory","time division multiple access","code division multiple access","access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information-theoretic considerations","symmetric cellular multiple-access fading channels","adjacent cell interference","Shannon theoretic arguments","performance","system parameters","cell-site receivers","adjacent cell site","processing complexity","time-division multiple access","TDMA","wideband techniques","fractional inter-cell time sharing","ICTS protocols","linear model","planar uplink","randomization","diversity","orthogonal code-division multiple access","CDMA","isolated cell scenario"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641554","doi":"10.1109/18.641554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/13816/00641554.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.641554","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-theoretic considerations for symmetric, cellular, multiple-access fading channels.

These include all information identities and inequalities of such types in the literature. As a consequence of this work, most identities and inequalities involving a definite number of random variables can now be verified by a software called ITIP which is available on the World Wide Web.

This can be viewed as a function defined on 2/sup {1,2,...,n}/ taking values in [0, +/spl infin/). We call this function the entropy function of /spl Omega/. The nonnegativity of the joint entropies implies that this function is nonnegative; the nonnegativity of the conditional joint entropies implies that this function is nondecreasing; and the nonnegativity of the conditional mutual information implies that this function is two-alternative. These properties are the so-called basic information inequalities of Shannon's information measures. An entropy function can be viewed as a 2/sup n/-1-dimensional vector where the coordinates are indexed by the subsets of the ground set {1,2,...,n}. As introduced by Yeng (see ibid., vol.43, no.6, p.1923-34, 1997) /spl Gamma//sub n/ stands for the cone in IR(2/sup n/-1) consisting of all vectors which have all these properties. Let /spl Gamma//sub n/* be the set of all 2/sup n/-1-dimensional vectors which correspond to the entropy functions of some sets of n discrete random variables. A fundamental information-theoretic problem is whether or not /spl Gamma/~/sub n/*=/spl Gamma//sub n/. Here /spl Gamma/~/sub n/* stands for the closure of the set /spl Gamma//sub n/*.

A 4-Gb DRAM fabricated using 0.15-/spl mu/m CMOS technology measures 986 mm/sup 2/. The memory cell is 0.23 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. Its capacitance of 60 fF is achieved by using a high-dielectric-constant material BST.","doi":"10.1109/4.641695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.641695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/13972/00641695.pdf","startPage":"1743","endPage":"1747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A four-level storage 4-Gb DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"A four-level storage 4-Gb DRAM","volume":"32","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5756152","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A four-level storage 4-Gb DRAM","sourcePdf":"00641695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022776S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"41","articleId":"641695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":641697,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Sung Jung","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Sung Jung","id":"37087293123"},{"name":"Do-Chan Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Do-Chan Choi","id":"37086979251"},{"name":"Sung-Hee Cho","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Hee Cho","id":"37087293714"},{"name":"Myong-Jae Kim","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myong-Jae Kim","id":"37087292783"},{"name":"Seung-Keun Lee","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Keun Lee","id":"37087292968"},{"name":"Byung-Soon Choi","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Soon Choi","id":"37087293020"},{"name":"Jin-Sun Yum","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Sun Yum","id":"37087292824"},{"name":"San-Hong Kim","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"San-Hong Kim","id":"37087292705"},{"name":"Dong-Gi Lee","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong-Gi Lee","id":"37087292011"},{"name":"Jong-Chang Son","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Chang Son","id":"37087293487"},{"name":"Myung-Sik Yong","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung-Sik Yong","id":"37087292753"},{"name":"Heung-Kwun Oh","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heung-Kwun Oh","id":"37087293594"},{"name":"Sung-Bu Jun","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Bu Jun","id":"37087293271"},{"name":"Woung-Moo Lee","affiliation":["DRAM Design, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Woung-Moo Lee","id":"37087292344"},{"name":"E.

Read and write operations are fully DRAM compatible except for a longer RAS precharge time after write. Fast random access time of 63 ns with the NAND flash memory cell is achieved by using a hierarchical row decoder scheme and a unique folded bit-line architecture which also allows bit-by-bit program verify and inhibit operation. Fast page mode with a column address access time of 21 ns is achieved by sensing and latching 4 k cells simultaneously. To allow byte alterability, nonvolatile restore operation with self-contained erase is developed. Self-contained erase is word-line based, and increased cell disturb due to the word-line based erase is relaxed by adding a boosted bit-line scheme to a conventional self-boosting technique. The device is fabricated in a 0.5-/spl mu/m triple-well, p-substrate CMOS process using two-metal and three-poly interconnect layers.

The spectral-domain approach is used to calculate complex power flows, leaving the line source in the transverse directions and those guided down the line source. By observing the behavior of these complex power flows in different frequency regions, the leaky-wave line source can be distinguished into the antenna mode and the reactive mode in the radiation region. Experimental results are shown to confirm this mode distinction. Moreover, by comparing the power carried away by the surface and the space waves, radiation efficiency of the first microstrip-line higher order mode of various structural parameters is analyzed.

We present a novel approach for fast training of such neural-network models based on the sparse matrix concept. The new training technique does not require any structure change in neural networks, but makes use of the inherent nature of neural networks that for each pattern some neuron activations are close to zero, and hence, have no effect on network outputs and weights update. Much of the computation effort is saved over standard training techniques, while achieving the same accuracy.

Amplitude control is performed by three sets of quasi-dual-gate MESFETs (two single-gate MESFETs in cascade) while the 120/spl deg/ shift among the vectors is achieved through LC filters covering the 1.4-2.7-GHz band.

All types of interconnects, i.e., uniform, nonuniform, lossless, lossy/dispersive, can be handled by the proposed model. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic radiation to interconnects can be directly modeled without the need for developing a new subcircuit. Another advantage of the proposed model is that it enables sensitivity analysis with respect to both circuit and interconnect parameters, thus facilitating interconnect circuit optimization. Chebyshev expansions for the spatial variations of the interconnect voltages and currents are used to effect highly accurate numerical approximations of the Telegrapher's equations using as small a number of degrees of freedom as possible. A simple rule of thumb is provided for the selection of the order of the approximation given the frequency bandwidth of interest. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and illustrate its application to a variety of interconnect-induced noise interactions in high-speed electronic systems.","doi":"10.1109/22.641783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/13974/00641783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.641783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An all-purpose transmission-line model for interconnect simulation in SPICE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission lines","Integrated circuit interconnections","Circuit simulation","Chebyshev approximation","Robustness","Nonlinear circuits","SPICE","Dispersion","Coupling circuits","Electromagnetic coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit interconnections","SPICE","transmission line theory","Chebyshev approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnect simulation","SPICE","multiconductor transmission line model","nonlinear circuit simulator","electromagnetic radiation coupling","sensitivity analysis","circuit optimization","Chebyshev expansion","numerical approximation","telegrapher equation","frequency bandwidth","noise","high-speed electronic system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"An all-purpose transmission-line model for interconnect simulation in SPICE","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5726806","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641783/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all-purpose transmission-line model for interconnect simulation in SPICE","sourcePdf":"00641783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042066S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","articleId":"641783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641784,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

The recent advances in RF and microwave high-density circuit packaging technologies in multifunction wireless communications systems have called for the parallel development of compact and efficient antennas that can be used over a wide frequency range. This paper addresses the development and characterization of several low-profile and integrated antennas with enhanced bandwidth for wireless communications systems. The new radiators are developed by adding parasitic elements or tuning devices to a familiar integrated antenna-the planar inverted F antenna (PIFA).

The circuit-oriented approach used by the method for the development of the numerical approximation of the electric-field integral equation leads to SPICE-compatible, yet fully dynamic, discrete approximation of the electromagnetic problem. Contrary to other full-wave formulations, the proposed method has the important attribute of lending itself to a very systematic and physical model complexity reduction on the basis of the electrical size of the various portions of the system. Thus, a hybrid electromagnetic modeling and simulation environment is established for the analysis of complex structures which exhibit large variation in electrical size over their volume, using a combination of lumped-circuit elements, transmission lines, as well as three-dimensional (3-D) distributed electromagnetic models. These models may or may not account for retardation, depending on the electrical size of the part of the structure that is being modeled. These special attributes of the proposed electromagnetic-simulation environment are demonstrated through several examples from its application to the modeling of noise interactions in generic interconnect and package geometries.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid electromagnetic modeling of noise interactions in packaged electronics based on the partial-element equivalent-circuit formulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.641787","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/13974/00641787.pdf","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.641787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=641787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid electromagnetic modeling of noise interactions in packaged electronics based on the partial-element equivalent-circuit formulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5726810","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid electromagnetic modeling of noise interactions in packaged electronics based on the partial-element equivalent-circuit formulation","sourcePdf":"00641787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082321S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"89","articleId":"641787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":641790,"authors":[{"name":"Yinchao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yinchao Chen","id":"37087145905"},{"name":"P.

The model for the package includes many details, such as the plastic encasement, bonding pads, and wires. The frequency responses of the package are tested against the results obtained with only the FDTD algorithm. It is shown that by extracting the equivalent-circuit elements from the field data, the hybrid FDTD-Touchstone technique allows greater flexibility in deriving a circuit configuration at the expense of fine tuning the circuit to reproduce the response of the package.

For interconnects characterized with frequency-dependent parasitic parameters, the order of the rational of approximation is reduced by using appropriate reference system.

Hashing is used extensively in hardware applications, such as page tables, for address translation. Bit extraction and exclusive ORing hashing \"methods\" are two commonly used hashing functions for hardware applications. There is no study of the performance of these functions and no mention anywhere of the practical performance of the hashing functions in comparison with the theoretical performance prediction of hashing schemes. In this paper, we show that, by choosing hashing functions at random from a particular class, called H/sub 3/, of hashing functions, the analytical performance of hashing can be achieved in practice on real-life data. Our results about the expected worst case performance of hashing are of special significance, as they provide evidence for earlier theoretical predictions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/13967/00641938.pdf","doi":"10.1109/12.641938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.641938","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hardware hashing functions for high performance computers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/641938/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hardware hashing functions for high performance computers","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5818799","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hardware hashing functions for high performance computers","sourcePdf":"00641938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044057S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"13967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"123","articleId":"641938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":641963,"authors":[{"name":"L.

At the same time it is increasingly driven by economic competition. These developments render the characterization of network usage and workloads more difficult, and yet more critical. Few recent studies have been published reporting Internet backbone traffic usage and characteristics. At MCI, we have implemented a high-performance, low-cost monitoring system that can capture traffic and perform analyses. We have deployed this monitoring tool on OC-3 trunks within the Internet MCI's backbone and also within the NSF-sponsored vBNS. This article presents observations on the patterns and characteristics of wide-area Internet traffic, as recorded by MCI's OC-3 traffic monitors. We report on measurements from two OC-3 trunks in MCI's commercial Internet backbone over two time ranges (24-hour and 7-day) in the presence of up to 240,000 flows. We reveal the characteristics of the traffic in terms of packet sizes, flow duration, volume, and percentage composition by protocol and application, as well as patterns seen over the two time scales.","doi":"10.1109/65.642356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.642356","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel4/65/13911/00642356.pdf","startPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-area Internet traffic patterns and characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/642356/","displayDocTitle":"Wide-area Internet traffic patterns and characteristics","volume":"11","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"5798061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-area Internet traffic patterns and characteristics","sourcePdf":"00642356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041947S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isNumber":"13911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"697","articleId":"642356","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":642358,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

An organization that provides shared caching to its Web clients will typically have a collection of shared caches rather than just one. For collections of shared caches, it is desirable to coordinate the caches so that all cached pages in the collection are shared among the organization's clients. In this article we investigate two classes of protocols for coordinating a collection of shared caches: the ICP protocol, which has caches ping each other to locate a cached object; and the hash routing protocols, which place objects in the shared caches as a function of the objects' URLs. Our contribution is twofold. First, we compare the performance of the protocols with respect to cache-server overhead and object retrieval latency; for a collection of shared caches, our analysis shows that the hash-routing schemes have significant performance advantages over ICP for both of the performance metrics. The existing hash-routing protocols assume that the cache servers are homogeneous in storage capacity and processing capability, even though most collections of cache servers are vastly heterogeneous. Our second contribution is to extend a robust hash-routing scheme so that it balances requests among the caches according to any desired distribution; the extended hash-routing scheme is robust in the face of cache failures, is tunable for heterogeneous caches, and can have significant performance advantages over ICP.","doi":"10.1109/65.642358","startPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel4/65/13911/00642358.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.642358","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hash routing for collections of shared Web caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/642358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hash routing for collections of shared Web caches","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5798063","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hash routing for collections of shared Web caches","sourcePdf":"00642358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038669S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isNumber":"13911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"95","articleId":"642358","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":642360,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The new architecture of the decoder/encoder targeted to reduce the circuit size and decoding latency has the following three features. First, a high area-efficiency has been achieved by sharing a functional block for encoding, modified syndrome computation, and erasure locator polynomial evaluation. Second, the circuit size and decoding latency has been reduced by using a new architecture to implement the modified Euclid's algorithm. Third, by doubling the internal clock speed (from 18 MHz to 36 MHz), the decoding latency and hence the memory size can be reduced. The decoder/encoder designed by using the proposed method uses a reduced number of gates, by about 30%, than the one based on the conventional architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/642367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5804786","volume":"43","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An area-efficient VLSI architecture of a Reed-Solomon decoder/encoder for digital VCRs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area-efficient VLSI architecture of a Reed-Solomon decoder/encoder for digital VCRs","sourcePdf":"00642367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041326S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"34","articleId":"642367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":642370,"authors":[{"name":"O.A.

It becomes possible to interpolate new fields at their correct temporal position. This results in smooth motion portrayal without loss of temporal resolution. However, motion vectors are not always valid for every pixel or object in an image. Therefore, visible artifacts occur wherever such wrong vectors are used on the image. One effective method to solve this problem is the use of non-linear filtering. In this method, a wrongly interpolated pixel is either substituted or averaged with neighbouring pixels. We introduce and evaluate a new and very robust upconversion algorithm which is based on the non-linear filtering approach. It is unique in that it estimates motion vector reliability and uses this information to control the filtering process. This algorithm outperforms others in its class, especially when we have complex image sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust motion-compensated video upconversion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.642370","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/30/13954/00642370.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.642370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=642370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/642370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Robust motion-compensated video upconversion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804789","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust motion-compensated video upconversion","sourcePdf":"00642370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034681S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"81","articleId":"642370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":642382,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Complex synchronization signals are transmitted along with the picture information for proper reproduction of the picture at the receiver. A totally different design methodology has been adopted for the generation of complex synchronizing (sync) signals as compared to the one reported earlier, so as to reduce the memory size from 8 K to only 226 bytes. This massive reduction in memory size made it possible to implement the whole design in a highly miniaturized single FPGA. Since the sync signals are complicated, a PROM is used to hold the waveform. In order to reduce the memory size, the basic time durations are chosen judiciously.

It has been tested and proved effective in a wide range of applications. The HMM model parameters are used to describe the utterance of the speech segment presented by the HMM. Many successful heuristic algorithms are developed to optimize the model parameters to best describe the training observation sequences. However, all these methods are exploring for only one local maximum in practice. No single method can be recovered from the local maximum and to obtain the global maximum or other more optimized local maxima. In this paper, a stochastic search method called the genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for HMM training. GA mimics natural evolution and performs searching within the defined searching space. Experimental results showed that using GA for HMM training (GA-HMM training) can obtain better solutions than using heuristic algorithms. One of the major drawbacks is that GAs require a lot of computation power for global searching before it can converge. Therefore, in order to outperform heuristic algorithms, a parallel version of GA called the parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) is introduced. Experimental results showed that using PGA in speech recognition systems provides 18% improvement in recognition rate with the same amount of computational time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/642391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804810","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of parallel genetic algorithms on HMM based speech recognition system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of parallel genetic algorithms on HMM based speech recognition system","sourcePdf":"00642391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023598S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"13954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"15","articleId":"642391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":642395,"authors":[{"name":"Ruei-Xi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ruei-Xi Chen","id":"37438784200"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"},{"name":"Mei-Juan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mei-Juan Chen","id":"37280978400"},{"name":"Tsung-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsung-Han Tsai","id":"37271381400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"642395","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Speech coding","Bit rate","Internet","Speech processing","Speech codecs","Coprocessors","Timing","Phase change materials","Acoustic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","speech coding","speech codecs","telephone sets","speech processing","teleconferencing","data communication","voice communication","pulse code modulation","coprocessors","network interfaces","digital signal processing chips","programmable logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I-phone system design","portable speech coding coprocessor","Internet-phone system","software","parallel port","speech compression unit","host interface","speakerphone module","speech coding","CPLD device","host access timing","PCM codec","audio amplifier","acoustic echo cancellation","coding rate","modems","full-duplex speech","digital simultaneous voice data transmission","video-conferencing","network-game talking","DSP coprocessor","16 bit","8.5 kbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a high quality, low bit rate, and portable Internet-phone system.

These algorithms need to be implemented in hardware in a high-speed switch. The authors present a number of approaches to implement scheduling algorithms in hardware. They begin by presenting a general methodology for the design of timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms that provide the same bounds on end-to-end delay and fairness as those of weighted fair queuing, yet have efficient hardware implementations. Based on this general methodology, the authors describe two specific algorithms, frame-based fair queuing and starting potential-based fair queuing, and discuss illustrative implementations in hardware. These algorithms may be used in both cell switches and packet switches with variable-size packets. A methodology for combining a traffic shaper with this class of fair queuing schedulers is also presented for use in network interface devices, such as an ATM segmentation and reassembly device.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/35/13916/00642834.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.642834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.642834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13916","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=642834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of fair queuing algorithms for asynchronous transfer mode networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Switches","Packet switching","Scheduling algorithm","Network interfaces","Quality of service","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","Delay","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","queueing theory","scheduling","network interfaces","telecommunication networks","delays","packet switching","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","ATM reassembly device","asynchronous transfer mode networks","quality of service guarantees","packet-based networks","cell-based networks","scheduling algorithm","network interfaces","high-speed switch","timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms","end-to-end delay","weighted fair queuing","frame-based fair queuing","starting potential-based fair queuing","cell switches","packet switches","variable-size packets","traffic shaper","fair queuing schedulers","network interface devices","ATM segmentation device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/642834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of fair queuing algorithms for asynchronous transfer mode networks","volume":"35","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5797463","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of fair queuing algorithms for asynchronous transfer mode networks","sourcePdf":"00642834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047086S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"13916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"57","articleId":"642834","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":642838,"authors":[{"name":"B.

One of the reasons is that it makes it possible to construct a single frequency network (SFN) and to make effective use of the frequency bands. In a SFN environment, however, some receivers will obtain their signals from more than one transmitter. This causes two effects, intersymbol interference and degradation of frequency characteristics due to echoes. This paper describes a theoretical study on the latter effect in a variety of signal numbers, D/U ratios and delays arriving at the receiving antenna and the BER (bit error rate) distribution within the coverage area of SFNs in a variety of the transmitter numbers with computer simulations on a virtual plain. Finally we suggest a method to improve the quality in a coverage area.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19960802","publicationTitle":"International Broadcasting Convention (Conf. Publ.

A digital 800 MHz FPU (field pick-up unit) that uses COFDM technology has been developed to enable stable live-TV transmission from moving vehicles. In the experimental COFDM-FPU, compressed digital video/audio data are distributed to 572 carriers within the 9 MHz bandwidth, using the DQPSK (differential quadrature phase shift keying) modulation scheme for each carrier. Field trials have been carried out for comparison with a conventional analogue FM-FPU. The COFDM digital FPU maintains video signal stability even under severe multipath fading conditions, when pictures of the conventional PM-FPU are seriously degraded.

The magnitudes of these components increase as the level of static eccentricity increases. The work reported in this paper applies finite element analysis to model a motor with static eccentricity to predict the severity of the fault from the magnitudes of these current components. The finite element results are compared with measured results from the test-rig motor being modelled and the agreement between them is found to be consistently closer than was achieved on previous attempts using the MMF and permeance wave approach. The finite element analysis is also used to determine what effect rotor slotting has on the magnitude of these components in relation to the overall changes in magnitude due to increasing static eccentricity levels. Different rotor slot designs were modelled (open, closed, semi-closed) and it was found that in terms of online current monitoring of induction motors the effect of different rotor slots on the magnitudes of the components was significant. This study has provided valuable information in terms of monitoring different motors in industry with the severity of the fault at different stages.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1997.643016","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

It is known that sensorless speed estimation techniques using RSHs may exhibit poor performance with certain motor designs. This paper examines the reasons for that poor performance which reflects differences in the magnitude of the slot harmonic signals consequent upon rotor design. Experimental results for a 30 kW motor with 6 different rotors are presented. The significant parameters are the number of rotor slots, skew and the accuracy of construction. It is clearly shown how inferior performance can arise. Conversely, improvements in reliability of speed estimation and transient response can be obtained by recognising those aspects which provide an enhanced signal, by minimising the background noise of the inverter/machine, or by enhancing the adaptive filter. The recursive maximum likelihood technique is presented as an improved algorithm for tuning the digital filter which aids transient response and reliability of speed estimation. Real time, experimental transient performance is demonstrated for the different rotors used in this paper and the performance failure of a particular slot combination demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '97.

The proposed algorithm can be used to predict insulation failure in the machine and to tune the parameters of a thermal model for overload protection. Microprocessor-based thermal protection has become widely available as a viable replacement for the traditional, mechanical trip element. If the thermal condition of the machine changes, however, existing microprocessor-based devices have no means of recognizing or correcting the built-in model. The proposed scheme enables the protection unit to adapt to changes in the thermal conductance between the rotor core and the ambient atmosphere, which could be caused by a broken fan, clogged air vents, or other factors that affect machine cooling. The algorithm compares one rotor speed estimate derived from terminal measurements to a more accurate estimate obtained by digital analysis of the rotor slot ripple. The error between the two estimates provides a corrective input to the thermal model. By continuing this process over a period of time after startup, the thermal time constant of the rotor can be derived. Additionally, by combining this approach with trend analysis, a supervisory algorithm can detect incipient failures in the electrical integrity of the machine.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1997.643019","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

The inverter-cable-motor model is developed, and the transient analysis is performed using the ATP-EMTP package to estimate the voltage distribution among the motor windings. High frequency parameters which correspond to the rise-time of the PWM wave front are used for the feeder cable and the motor in the ATP model. The high frequency parameters of the induction motor are calculated using field analysis and the parameters of the cable are computed using the Cable Constants routine in the ATP package. Using these parameters, a high frequency equivalent circuit of the inverter-cable-motor model is formed in ATP which is then used to estimate the voltage stresses at the motor terminals and the motor windings. Using this model, the effects of cable on the voltage distribution among the motor winding is analyzed and discussed. In order to check the validity of the model, simulation results are compared with experimental data. The proposed model is a general purpose model and hence can be used for detailed transient analysis with different configurations of the cable and filters.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1997.643020","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

Initially, the vibration monitoring system records two baseline measurements of current and vibration with the machine operating under normal conditions. The baseline data is then evaluated to determine the critical frequencies to monitor on-line. Once these frequencies are determined, the baseline vibration measurement is simply used to scale the current harmonic signal to an estimated vibration level. Based on theoretical analysis, simulation results, and the experimental results shown here, a linear relationship between the current harmonics and vibration level can be assumed. The results of two experiments on a three-phase 230 V, 10 HP induction motor operating under no load are discussed and show the feasibility of this method for sensorless on-line vibration monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5753297","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 1997","displayDocTitle":"A method for sensorless on-line vibration monitoring of induction machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for sensorless on-line vibration monitoring of induction machines","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029773S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939","citationCount":"8","articleId":"643028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":643042,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the development of dedicated hardware implementations which facilitate high speed processing. However, the main drawback of such an approach is that it is only cost effective for high-volume applications. A more feasible methodology for lower volume problems demands the application of general-purpose or programmable hardware such as the Xilinx FPGAs. There has been a similar trend in the area of neural networks, as initial research employed software simulations but more recent interest has investigated hardware implementations. FPGAs are becoming increasingly popular for prototyping and designing complex hardware systems. The structure of an FPGA can be described as an \"array of blocks\" connected together via programmable interconnections. The main advantage of FPGAs is the flexibility that they afford. An engineer can change and refine a device's design by exploiting the device's reprogrammability. Xilinx introduced the world's first FPGA, the XC2064, in 1985. This contained approximately 1000 logic gates. Since then, the gate density of Xilinx FPGAs has increased 25 times. There has been a lot of recent interest in the FPGA realisation of fuzzy systems. Similarly there are a number of FPGA implementations of neural networks reported in the literature. However. this paper provides a report on the implementation of both architectures and also offers a comparison with the hybrid structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"9 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643114/","accessionNumber":"5615700","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-9 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using Xilinx FPGAs to implement neural networks and fuzzy systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Xilinx FPGAs to implement neural networks and fuzzy systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00643114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034373S","chronDate":"9 May 1997","isNumber":"13997","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161","citationCount":"3","articleId":"643114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":643123,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

Therefore, a linear model of a SRM can predict its performance characteristics only for a limited range of operation. An accurate and comprehensive nonlinear model of SRM, however, is extremely complicated and is computationally intensive to be implemented in real time for control purposes. To alleviate some of these difficulties, several simplified models are presented in the literature. These models, however, lack accuracy. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used successfully in the control of nonlinear dynamic systems. This paper presents an ANN based torque control scheme of SRM which generates optimal current profiles to minimize torque pulsation. Theoretically, it is found that for each speed and torque below base speed there are several current profiles which produce the desired torque without any pulsation. This method finds the one which gives the maximum torque per ampere. Unlike the other ANN based nonlinear modeling of SRM presented in the literature which uses static magnetization data for training, the training data for the ANN in the proposed method is obtained from the simulation of a dynamic model of the SRM. The proposed control scheme, therefore, controls torque on an instantaneous basis, thus allowing torque control even during the dynamic operation of the motor. In order to include the effect of the nonlinearity, the dynamic model of the SRM uses static magnetization data generated experimentally. Operation of the SRM from zero speed to the base speed is considered. Simulation results of the optimal torque control scheme are presented.

The detection method uses the change of the derivative of the phase current to detect the position where a rotor pole and stator pole start to overlap, giving one position update per energy conversion. As no a priori knowledge of motor parameters is required (except for the numbers of stator and rotor poles), the method is applicable to most SRM topologies in a wide power and speed range and for several inverter topologies. The method allows medium performance closed-loop dynamics. To start up the motor a feedforward method is used which assures robust start-up from stand-still up to a minimum speed even under load. Experimental results demonstrate the robust functionality of the method with just one current sensor in the lower transistor bus, even with excitation overlap. The method is comparable to the back-EMF position estimation for brushless DC motors. A detailed operation and implementation of this scheme is shown, together with steady-state and dynamic transient test results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643124/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","volume":"1","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5753342","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 1997","displayDocTitle":"A new sensorless method for switched reluctance motor drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new sensorless method for switched reluctance motor drives","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030726S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939","citationCount":"11","articleId":"643124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":643132,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Energy optimal control strategies are reviewed and cos (/spl phi/) control, a model-based control and a search control are implemented in the laboratory in a vector and a scalar drive. The convergence speed for the strategies and their ability to reject disturbances are investigated by experiments. It is also shown experimentally that for both standard and high-efficiency motors, motor efficiency improvement is achievable by energy optimal control below 60% load torque. The energy savings using energy optimal control strategies are measured on a pump-system with a certain load-cycle.

However the low-speed performance of this method is unsatisfactory. Some papers have been published to improve the performance of DTC, but they are often too complicated or not applicable to very low-speed areas. This paper investigates the torque characteristics of an induction motor in the low-speed range in a fully digital control system. The discrete effects of the control have been analysed in the paper. One simple scheme based on predictive control of the torque is proposed. Another problem is the dead-time effect in PWM inverters which influences the low-speed performance. A method of compensation by adding a dead-time vector to the flux calculation is realised. Simulation results show that, with the proposed schemes, very good dynamic response and steady state precision can be obtained and this is confirmed by experiments with a digital control structure using a TMS320C25 digital signal processor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1997.643156","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

We exploit the concept of generalised matching, a technique that finds symbolically all possible matching assignments of library cells to a multi-output network specified by a Boolean relation. Several objectives are targeted: area minimization under delay constraints; power minimization under delay constraints; and unconstrained delay minimization. We describe the theory of generalized matching and the algorithmic optimization required for its efficient and robust implementation. A tool based on generalized matching has been implemented and tested on large examples of the MCNC'91 benchmark suite. We obtain sizable improvements in: speed (6% in average, up to 20.7%); area under speed constraints (13.7% an average, up to 29.5%); and power under speed constraints (22.3% in average, up to 38.1%).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643255/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5781395","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generalized matching from theory to application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized matching from theory to application","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050549S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"2","articleId":"643255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":643266,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hong Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Hong Hwang","id":"37614333500"},{"name":"Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wu","id":"37287873500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643266","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very-large-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","integrated circuit design","circuit optimisation","delays","minimisation","finite state machines","logic CAD","integrated logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive system shutdown method","energy saving","event-driven computation","system-level power management","power saving","sleep mode operations","exponential-average approach","idle period","prediction-miss correction","pre-wakeup","hit ratio","delay overhead","low delay penalties","VLSI circuit design","logic CAD","finite state machine"]}],"abstract":"We present a system-level power management technique for power saving of event-driven applications.

Due to uncertainties in specification of such properties, the average power should be specified between a maximum and a minimum possible value. Due to the complex nature of the problem, it is practically impossible to use traditional power estimation techniques to determine such bounds. We present a novel approach to accurately estimate the maximum and minimum bounds for average power using a technique which calculates the sensitivities of average power dissipation to primary input signal properties. The sensitivities are calculated using a novel statistical technique and can be obtained as a by-product of average power estimation using a Monte Carlo based approach. The signal properties are specified in terms of signal probability (probability of a signal being logic ONE) and signal activity (probability of signal switching). Results show that the maximum and minimum average power dissipation can vary widely if the primary input probabilities and activities are not specified accurately.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power sensitivity-a new method to estimate power dissipation considering uncertain specifications of primary inputs","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643276","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643276.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Power sensitivity-a new method to estimate power dissipation considering uncertain specifications of primary inputs","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781399","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power sensitivity-a new method to estimate power dissipation considering uncertain specifications of primary inputs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040178S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"18","articleId":"643276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":643278,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This topology is very useful whenever it is required to sense a differential voltage at the input whose common-mode level is different to that at the output. With the AFA no ambiguity about the input and output grounds arises; compare this to op-amp based applications where one always has to decide where the 'ground' should be referenced to - input or output? Furthermore, when the op-amp is viewed as an integrator and not as an infinite-gain, infinite bandwidth block, then at frequencies not too remote from the unity-gain frequency the op-amp will be nothing like the infinite-gain block it is supposed to be. The AFA in contrast provides accurate performance right up to its unity-gain frequency.

Passivity is the one circuit-theoretic property that is vital for the successful simulation of a large circuit netlist containing reduced-order models of its interconnect networks. Non-passive reduced-order models may lead to instabilities even if they are themselves stable. We address the problem of guaranteeing the accuracy and passivity of reduced-order models of multiport RLC networks at any finite number of expansion points. The novel passivity-preserving model-order reduction scheme is a block version of the rational Arnoldi algorithm (Ruhe, 1994). The scheme reduces to that of (Odabasioglu et al., 1997) when applied to a single expansion point at zero frequency. Although the treatment of this paper is restricted to expansion points that are on the negative real axis, it is shown that the resulting passive reduced-order model is superior in accuracy to the one that would result from expanding the original model around a single point. Nyquist plots are used to illustrate both the passivity and the accuracy of the reduced order models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5781403","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"A block rational Arnoldi algorithm for multipoint passive model-order reduction of multiport RLC networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A block rational Arnoldi algorithm for multipoint passive model-order reduction of multiport RLC networks","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06997S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"100","articleId":"643368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":643378,"authors":[{"name":"Goldberg","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA","National Academy of Science of Belarus, Minsk, Belarus"],"lastName":"Goldberg","id":"37063024500"},{"name":"Carloni","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Carloni","id":"37282454900"},{"name":"Villa","affiliation":["PARADES, Rome, Italy"],"lastName":"Villa","id":"37320616000"},{"name":"Brayton","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Brayton","id":"37275814500"},{"name":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","id":"38271978500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643378","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Problem-solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["problem solving","logic CAD","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental problem solving","unate covering","discrete optimization","negative thinking","AURA","unate covering problem","pruning strategy"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a new technique to solve exactly a discrete optimization problem, based on the paradigm of \"negative\" thinking. The motivation is that when searching the space of solutions, often a good solution is reached quickly and then improved only a few times before the optimum is found: hence most of the solution space is explored to certify optimality, but it does not yield any improvement of the cost function. So it is quite natural for an algorithm to be \"skeptical\" about the chance to improve the current best solution. For illustration we have applied our approach to the unate covering problem. We designed a procedure, raiser, implementing a negative thinking search, which is incorporated into a common branch-and-bound procedure. Experiments show that our program, AURA, outperforms both ESPRESSO and our enhancement of ESPRESSO using Coudert's limit lower bound. It is always faster and in the most difficult examples either has a running time better by up to two orders of magnitude, or the other programs fail to finish due to timeout or spaceout. The package SCHERZO is faster on some examples and loses on others, due to a less powerful pruning strategy of the search space, partially mitigated by a more effective computation of the maximal independent set.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643378","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","startPage":"91","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative thinking by incremental problem solving: application to unate covering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Negative thinking by incremental problem solving: application to unate covering","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643378/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781407","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative thinking by incremental problem solving: application to unate covering","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038449S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"8","articleId":"643378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":643380,"authors":[{"name":"Gebotys","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Gebotys","id":"37265040400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643380","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":24},"abstract":"This paper presents a new approach to solving the DSP address assignment problem.

Results also show that memory layout has a small effect on code size and performance when optimal addressing is used. This research is important for industry since this value-added technique can improve code size, power dissipation and performance, without increasing cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643380.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"103","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP address optimization using a minimum cost circulation technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","digital signal processing chips","compiler generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP address assignment","optimization","minimum cost circulation","addressing code","polynomial time","compiler-generated DSP code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"DSP address optimization using a minimum cost circulation technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781408","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP address optimization using a minimum cost circulation technique","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093753S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"25","articleId":"643380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":643382,"authors":[{"name":"Kirovski","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kirovski","id":"37283298000"},{"name":"Lee","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lee","id":"37367281600"},{"name":"Potkonjak","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Potkonjak","id":"37279233100"},{"name":"Mangione-Smith","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Mangione-Smith","id":"38272053400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643382","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"We developed a new hierarchical modular approach for synthesis of area-minimal core-based data-intensive systems.

The architecture of Global Harmony involves a careful combination of static noise analysis, static timing analysis, and reduced-order modelling techniques.

A variety of economic and technical forces have produced large industrial gas turbines with ever increasing levels of efficiency, and operators are now being offered combined-cycle gas turbine plant with efficiencies of 57-60%. Simultaneously the operating companies are under continued pressure to minimise operating and maintenance costs. Since fuel costs represent the main part of the running costs, high efficiency units are attractive, providing they can meet the projected reliability and availability targets. To minimise operator risks it is prudent to seriously consider the level of monitoring a unit requires, and whether this should go beyond that normally offered. It is within this context that the role of sensors and the associated opportunities lie. They provide a fuller picture of the operating conditions within the unit, allowing a move towards a condition monitoring based decision making process for both operational and maintenance issues. This paper provides a review of advanced sensoring techniques for monitoring the condition of gas turbines with particular emphasis on those parameters likely to be affected by the design changes found in the newer units. These include: vibration monitoring; performance monitoring; lubrication system monitoring; pyrometry; and continuous emissions monitoring. Techniques under development are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Mar 1996","conferenceDate":"18-20 March 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5263387","displayDocTitle":"Opportunities for advanced sensors for condition monitoring of gas turbines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunities for advanced sensors for condition monitoring of gas turbines","confLoc":"Durham, UK","sourcePdf":"00643456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019196S","chronDate":"18-20 Mar 1996","isNumber":"14025","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5185","citationCount":"13","articleId":"643456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":643460,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Its operational condition affects the electricity supply reliability and the power system stability. With modern generators, protection and monitoring equipment are employed routinely to prevent damage. Rotor winding short circuits occur relatively frequently and if continuous, can lead to high temperatures and excessive vibration of the rotor resulting in damage to the generator if the fault is not cleared. To detect shorted turns in the rotor windings, several methods have been used for many years, for example, the airgap search coil technique, the monitoring of circulating stator current in double circuit machines, measurement the rotor shaft voltage, and the recurrent surge oscillograph method. Here, a novel method which looks at the harmonic components present in the generator excitation current is proposed to detect both stator and rotor winding shorts. Analytical justification of the method is given together with experimental results obtained using two synchronous machines of different ratings, both of which have single circuit stator windings and four pole salient rotors.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19960135","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Opportunities and Advances in International Electric Power Generation (Conf.

The tree topology restriction precludes the use of these methods in several sizing problems of significant importance to high-performance deep submicron design including, for example, circuits with loops of resistors, e.g. clock distribution meshes, and circuits with coupling capacitors, e.g. buses with crosstalk between the lines. The paper proposes a new optimization method which can be used to address these problems. The method uses the dominant time constant as a measure of signal propagation delay in an RC circuit, instead of Elmore delay. Using this measure, sizing of any RC circuit can be cast as a convex optimization problem which can be solved using the recently-developed efficient interior-point methods for semidefinite programming. The method is applied to two important sizing problems-the sizing of clock meshes and the sizing of buses in the presence of crosstalk.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimal wire and transistor sizing for circuits with non-tree topology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal wire and transistor sizing for circuits with non-tree topology","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061693S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"20","articleId":"643528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":643529,"authors":[{"name":"Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan","Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37278947900"},{"name":"Inouet","lastName":"Inouet","id":"37086999766"},{"name":"Kajitani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kajitani","id":"37265748600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643529","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":38},"abstract":"It is known that the clock period can be shorter than the maximum of the signal delays between registers if the clock arrival time to each register is properly scheduled.

Following the deferred-merge-embedding (DME) framework, the algorithm generates a topology of the clock tree and determines the locations and sizes of intermediate buffers simultaneously. The experimental results show that this method constructs clock trees with moderate wire length compared with that of zero-skew clock trees.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643529.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock-tree routing realizing a clock-schedule for semi-synchronous circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","circuit layout CAD","sequential circuits","asynchronous circuits","network routing","network topology","delays","scheduling","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock-tree routing algorithm","optimal clock schedule","semi-synchronous circuits","clock period","signal delays","registers","clock arrival time","Elmore delay model","deferred-merge-embedding framework","clock tree topology","intermediate buffers","wire length","zero-skew clock trees"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Clock-tree routing realizing a clock-schedule for semi-synchronous circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781431","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock-tree routing realizing a clock-schedule for semi-synchronous circuits","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071729S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"12","articleId":"643529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":643538,"authors":[{"name":"Raje","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The main characteristics of this work are: interleaved register and functional unit merging in a global clique partitioning based framework, accurate merging cost estimation, accurate interconnect cost estimation, relative control cost taken into account and efficient false loop elimination.

With the increasing gap between on-chip and off-chip memory access delays, it is imperative to exploit the efficient access mode features of modern-day memories (e.g. page-mode DRAMs) in order to alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Our work addresses this issue by: (a) modeling realistic off-chip memory access modes for High-level Synthesis (HLS), (b) presenting algorithms to infer applicability of HLS with these memory access modes, and (c) transforming input behavior to provide further memory access optimizations during HLS. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using a suite of memory-intensive benchmarks with a realistic DRAM library module.

Due to its nonrecursive property and closed-form analytic solution, this method can excel as a tool for designing optimal optical communication systems and lumped optical equalizers to compensate for effects such as linear dispersion, fiber nonlinearities and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from optical amplifiers. We demonstrate that a third-order approximation to the VSTF model compares favorably with the split-step Fourier (recursive) method in accuracy for power levels used in current optical communication systems. For higher power levels, there is a potential for improving the accuracy by including higher-order Volterra kernels at the cost of increased computations. Single-pulse propagation and the interaction between two pulses propagating at two different frequencies are also analyzed with the Volterra method to verify the ability to accurately model nonlinear effects.

This problem has, however been cursorily treated in previous partitioning and placement research. Our work presented here addresses the balance-ratio constraint, and is a crucial first step to an effective solution to the general constraint-satisfaction problem. In current iterative-improvement mincut partitioners, the balance-ratio constraint is tackled by disallowing moves that violate it. These methods can lead to sub-optimal solutions since the process is biased against the movement of large cells and clusters of cells. We present techniques for an informed relaxation process that attempts to estimate whether relaxing the constraint temporarily will ultimately benefit the mincut objective. If so, then a violating move is allowed, otherwise it is disallowed.

We present a new approach to exact and canonical symbolic analysis by exploiting the sparsity and sharing of product terms. It consists of representing the symbolic determinant of a circuit matrix by a graph-called determinant decision diagram (DDD)-and performing symbolic analysis by graph manipulations. We showed that DDD construction and DDD-based symbolic analysis can be performed in time complexity proportional to the number of DDD vertices. We described a vertex ordering heuristic, and showed that the number of DDD vertices can be quite small-usually orders-of-magnitude less than the number of product terms. The algorithm has been implemented. An order-of-magnitude improvement in both CPU time and memory usage over existing symbolic analyzers ISAAC and Maple-V has been observed for large analog circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643562.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"373","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic analysis of large analog circuits with determinant decision diagrams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","symbol manipulation","diagrams","directed graphs","circuit CAD","computational complexity","analogue integrated circuits","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbolic analog-circuit analysis","determinant decision diagrams","analog synthesis","testability analysis","product terms","circuit matrix","graph manipulations","time complexity","vertex ordering heuristic","CPU time","memory usage","ISAAC","Maple-V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic analysis of large analog circuits with determinant decision diagrams","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781443","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic analysis of large analog circuits with determinant decision diagrams","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074743S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"24","articleId":"643562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":643563,"authors":[{"name":"Leyn","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"lastName":"Leyn","id":"37331327000"},{"name":"Daems","affiliation":["Belgian Fund for Scientific Research, Belgium"],"lastName":"Daems","id":"37327229400"},{"name":"Gielen","affiliation":["Belgian Fund for Scientific Research, Belgium"],"lastName":"Gielen","id":"37275184800"},{"name":"Sansen","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"lastName":"Sansen","id":"37275189100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643563","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","circuit analysis computing","digital simulation","poles and zeros","circuit CAD","circuit optimisation","minimax techniques","integrated circuit modelling","CMOS analogue integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioral signal path modeling methodology","CMOS opamps","operational amplifiers","symbolic simulation","small-signal functioning","poles and zeros","design parameters","interactive sizing process","EF2ef","circuit optimization","pole placement","hierarchical penalty function composition","design space pruning","DC formulation","local minimax optimization","interactive design space exploration","CAD","analog circuit modeling"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a new modeling methodology that allows to derive systematically behavioral signal path models of operational amplifiers. Combined with symbolic simulation, these models provide high qualitative insight into the small-signal functioning of a circuit. The behavioral signal path model provides compact interpretable expressions for the poles and zeros that constitute the signal path. These expressions show which design parameters have dominant influence on the position of a pole/zero and thus enable a designer to control a manual interactive sizing process. The methodology consists of the application of a sequence of abstractions, so that one gradually progresses from a full device to a full behavior circuit representation. During this translation, qualitative insight and design requirements are obtained. The methodology is implemented in an open tool called EF2ef. The behavioral signal path model is also used for optimization based sizing in order to achieve pole placement in an efficient way. For optimization based siting, a new strategy for hierarchical penalty function composition is proposed, which allows sequential pruning of the design space. Combined with an operating point driven DC formulation and local minimax optimization, a fast sizing method is obtained which can be used for interactive design space exploration. Experimental results of both modeling and siting are shown.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643563","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643563.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A behavioral signal path modeling methodology for qualitative insight in and efficient sizing of CMOS opamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643563/","displayDocTitle":"A behavioral signal path modeling methodology for qualitative insight in and efficient sizing of CMOS opamps","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781444","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A behavioral signal path modeling methodology for qualitative insight in and efficient sizing of CMOS opamps","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082267S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"24","articleId":"643563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":643564,"authors":[{"name":"Variyam","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Variyam","id":"37087167319"},{"name":"Chatterjee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37087166432"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643564","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","automatic testing","transient response","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","time-domain analysis","circuit optimisation","biquadratic filters","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test generation algorithm","linear analog circuit testing","transient response sampling","time-to-market","mixed-signal integrated circuits","implicit functional testing","parametric deviations","single fault assumption","measurements","transient response","time domain sensitivity calculation","test waveform","biquadratic filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643564","abstract":"The problem of testing analog components continues to be the bottleneck in reducing the time-to-market of mixed-signal ICs.

These bounds are mapped on to \"acceptable\" ranges of measurements of the transient response of the CUT at various sample points using time domain sensitivity calculations.

As a result, the LSR/MFFS algorithm has achieved the best cutsize result among all the bipartitioning algorithms published in the literatures with very promising runtime performance.

MOGAC synthesizes real-time heterogeneous distributed architectures using an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm that can escape local minima. Price and power consumption are optimized while hard real-time constraints are met. MOGAC places no limit on the number of hardware or software processing elements in the architectures it synthesizes. Our general model for bus and point-to-point communication links allows a number of link types to be used in an architecture. Application-specific integrated circuits consisting of multiple processing elements are modeled. Heuristics are used to tackle multi-rate systems, as well as systems containing task graphs whose hyperperiods are large relative to their periods. The application of a multiobjective optimization strategy allows a single co-synthesis run to produce multiple designs which trade off different architectural features. Experimental results indicate that MOGAC has advantages over previous work in terms of solution quality and running time.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643589","startPage":"522","endPage":"529","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1997.643589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14033","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5191/14033/00643589.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOGAC: a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the co-synthesis of hardware-software embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643589/","displayDocTitle":"MOGAC: a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the co-synthesis of hardware-software embedded systems","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5781465","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOGAC: a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the co-synthesis of hardware-software embedded systems","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068683S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191","citationCount":"37","articleId":"643589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":643590,"authors":[{"name":"Sarrafzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, USA"],"lastName":"Sarrafzadeh","id":"37278987300"},{"name":"Maogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, USA"],"lastName":"Maogang Wang","id":"37367591300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8200-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-3152"}],"articleNumber":"643590","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","circuit layout CAD","minimisation of switching nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NRG","global detailed placement","placement problem","input circuit","2D global grid","global placement","final optimization","simulated annealing","placement package","area minimization","timing-driven placement","wavelength"]}],"abstract":"We present a new approach to the placement problem.

Decomposed BDDs can represent large, arbitrary functions as a multistage circuit and can exploit the natural, efficient mapping of a BDD to PTL. A comprehensive synthesis flow based on decomposed BDDs is outlined for PTL design. They show that the proposed approach allows one to make logic-level optimizations similar to the traditional multi-level network based synthesis flow for static CMOS, and also makes possible optimizations with a direct impact on area, delay and power of the final circuit implementation which do nor have any equivalent in the traditional approach. They also present a set of heuristical algorithms to synthesize PTL circuits optimized for area, delay and power which are key to the proposed synthesis flow. Experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that the technique yields PTL circuits with substantial improvements over static CMOS designs.

Major advantages of electric propulsion include low noise, reduced operating cost, increased flexibility of operation and improved naval architecture. Future generations of naval surface ships will be propelled by directly coupled electric motors at around 20 MW 200 rpm per shaft. The naval application is a very challenging one, requiring an efficient motor, with high volumetric power and torque density, high reliability and durability. Permanent magnet motors offer a number of benefits for this application and many of the world's navies are now looking to introduce electric propulsion technology using one or other form of permanent magnet synchronous motor driven from a PWM voltage source inverter. Rolls-Royce International Research and Development (IRD) have been concentrating on one particular form of permanent magnet synchronous motor, known as the transverse flux motor (TFM). This offers particularly good torque density in addition to low vibration signature and high reliability. Development of the TFM at IRD has progressed from initial feasibility appraisal through to detailed design studies, experimental rigs and materials investigations and work is now commencing on a 3 MW demonstrator motor which is being built under funding from the UK Ministry of Defence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transverse flux motors for electric propulsion of ships","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on New Topologies for Permanent Magnet Machines (Digest No: 1997/090)","doi":"10.1049/ic:19970520","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on New Topologies for Permanent Magnet Machines (Digest No: 1997/090)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5151/13987/00643628.pdf","startPage":"3/1","endPage":"3/6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19970520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Transverse flux motors for electric propulsion of ships","conferenceDate":"18-18 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5665830","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transverse flux motors for electric propulsion of ships","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00643628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032827S","chronDate":"18 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13987","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5151","citationCount":"37","articleId":"643628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":643644,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

Fifty years later, the authors are still working with silicon but it is a very different silicon effort. Currently with the silicon optical bench they are trying to integrate optical components the way transistors have been over the last 50 years. So, silicon technology is still progressing. When considering the invention of the transistor, the authors note that the work of Bardeen and Brattain was really a discovery not an invention. At the time they discovered transistor action, they were investigating the nature of surface states and ways to reduce their presence. It was only later that things really became clear as to what was going on. Fifty years later that discovery is celebrated, and the authors present a brief history of the major events and the key people involved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643644/","volume":"32","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5790412","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A history of the invention of the transistor and where it will lead us","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A history of the invention of the transistor and where it will lead us","sourcePdf":"00643644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042755S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"69","articleId":"643644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":643645,"authors":[{"name":"S.-U.

Proper operation is obtained using the switched-opamp technique without any clock voltage multiplier or low-threshold devices. This makes the circuit compatible with future deep submicrometer technology. As opposed to previous switched-opamp implementations, the filter uses a fully differential topology. This allows operation with a rail-rail output swing and reduction of the number of opamps required to build high order infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. On the other hand, a low-voltage common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuit is required. In addition, the circuit uses an opamp which is only partially turned off during the off phase. This enables an increase in the maximum sampling frequency. The filter implements a bandpass response (f/sub s//f/sub o/=4, Q=7) and it has been characterized with a 1.8 MHz sampling frequency. Its power consumption is about 160 /spl mu/W.

The resulting topology is similar to the well known nested Miller compensation (NMC) multistage amplifier, except that the proposed topology contains extra G/sub m/ feedforward stages which are used to enhance the amplifier performance. The NGCC simplifies the transfer function of the proposed multistage amplifier which, in turn, simplifies its stability conditions. A comparison between the NGCC and NMC shows that the NGCC has wider bandwidth and is easier to stabilize. A four-stage NGCC amplifier has been fabricated using a 2-/spl mu/m CMOS process and is tested using a /spl plusmn/1.0 V power supply. A dc gain of 100 dB has been measured.

The analog 2-D DCT processor is essentially suitable for the on-sensor image compression, since the analog image sensor signal can be directly processed. The small and low-power nature of the analog design allows us to achieve low-power, low-cost, one-chip digital video cameras. The 8/spl times/8-point analog 2-D DCT processor is designed with fully differential switched-capacitor circuits to obtain sufficient precision for video compression purposes. An imager array has a dedicated eight-channel parallel readout scheme for direct encoding with the analog 2-D DCT processor. The variable level quantization after the 2-D DCT can be performed by the ADC at the same time. A prototype CMOS image sensor integrating these core circuits for compression is implemented based on triple-metal double-polysilicon 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. Image encoding using the implemented analog 2-D DCT processor to the image captured by the sensor is successfully performed. The maximum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is 36.7 dB.","doi":"10.1109/4.643661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel3/4/14037/00643661.pdf","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.643661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS image sensor with analog two-dimensional DCT-based compression circuits for one-chip cameras","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS image sensor with analog two-dimensional DCT-based compression circuits for one-chip cameras","volume":"32","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5790427","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS image sensor with analog two-dimensional DCT-based compression circuits for one-chip cameras","sourcePdf":"00643661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03729S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"98","articleId":"643661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":643662,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

While any shortest-path algorithm can be used to select a feasible path, additional constraints that limit resource consumption and balance the network load are needed to achieve efficient resource utilization. We present a systematic evaluation of four routing algorithms that offer different tradeoffs between limiting the path hop count and balancing the network load. Our evaluation considers not only the call blocking rate but also the fairness to requests for different bandwidths, robustness to inaccurate routing information, and sensitivity to the routing information update frequency. It evaluates not only the performance of these algorithms for the sessions with bandwidth guarantees, but also their impact on the lower priority best-effort sessions. Our results show that a routing algorithm that gives preference to limiting the hop count performs better when the network load is heavy, while an algorithm that gives preference to balancing the network load performs slightly better when the network load is light. We also show that the performance of using pre-computed paths with a few discrete bandwidth requests is comparable to that of computing paths on-demand, which implies feasibility of class-based routing. We observe that the routing information update interval can be set reasonably large to reduce routing overhead without sacrificing the overall performance, although an increased number of sessions can be misrouted.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.1997.643714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13855","startPage":"191","endPage":"202","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 International Conference on Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel4/5067/13855/00643714.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On path selection for traffic with bandwidth guarantees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"On path selection for traffic with bandwidth guarantees","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5767742","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On path selection for traffic with bandwidth guarantees","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00643714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062061S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5067","citationCount":"103","articleId":"643714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":643740,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The probe has been used to make complex dielectric properties measurements over the complete frequency band from 500 MHz to 3 GHz, and up to temperatures as high as 1000/spl deg/C. In this paper, we investigate new aspects of the development and utilization of this high-temperature dielectric probe. The first aspect is related to the results of an uncertainty analysis which was performed to quantify the errors due to the differential thermal expansion between the inner and outer conductors of metal coaxial probes. In this case, a two-dimensional (2-D) cylindrical finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code was developed and used for this analysis. The obtained results were compared and shown to be in good agreement with error-analysis data based on analytical solutions for the special case when an air gap exists between the probe and the material under test. Additional new error-analysis results show that differential thermal expansions and rough surfaces cause considerable errors in these measurements, and the use of probes of small differential thermal expansions, such as the developed metallized-ceramic probe, is essential for obtaining accurate results. We also used FDTD numerical simulations to help investigate the use of this probe for the nondestructive complex-permittivity measurements of electrically \"thin\" samples. It is shown that by backing the material under test with a standard material of known dielectric constant, such as air or metal, the complex permittivity of thin samples can be accurately measured. The other new development is related to the use of the developed metallized-ceramic probe to measure the dielectric properties of thin samples at high temperature and over a broad frequency band. With the developed knowledge from the error analysis, and the new FDTD code for thin-sample measurements, the metallized-ceramic probe was used to measure dielectric properties of thin Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and sapphire samples for temperatures up to 1000/spl deg/C. This measurement method has important applications in the on-line characterization of semiconductor wafers. Results from the high-temperature thin-sample measurements and the uncertainty analysis are presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.643740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14038/00643740.pdf","startPage":"2073","endPage":"2083","doi":"10.1109/22.643740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin-sample measurements and error analysis of high-temperature coaxial dielectric probes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Thin-sample measurements and error analysis of high-temperature coaxial dielectric probes","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5804539","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-sample measurements and error analysis of high-temperature coaxial dielectric probes","sourcePdf":"00643740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034628S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"22","articleId":"643740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":643745,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The cornerstone of this efficient modeling framework is based on a method of moments (MoM) that makes use of the explicit representation of a generalized matrix of network parameters. To physically formulate the equivalent multiport network for a multiport circuit, a delta-gap voltage source backed by a vertical electric wall is conceptually introduced to terminate each port. In this way, the multiport microstrip circuit to be modeled is externally connected at an adequate location. The image principle is applied at the port to remove the electric wall and the open environment can effectively be simulated. With the unified impressed delta-gap source model and appropriate partition of the entire multiport circuit topology, a MoM procedure is developed and applied to extract the network parameters directly from the field-theoretical formulations. All possible physical phenomena such as radiation and leakage losses are incorporated in the algorithm. Two distinctive examples presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for handling multilayered multiport passive and antenna circuits. Convergence analysis is made for the filter example compared with experimental results, showing that the proposed algorithm is very stable and accurate. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the implicit unbounded effects may be influential on electrical performance and should be considered in such a field-theoretical modeling and design tool as proposed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5804544","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of unbounded multiport microstrip passive circuits using an explicit network-based method of moments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of unbounded multiport microstrip passive circuits using an explicit network-based method of moments","sourcePdf":"00643745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034671S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"45","articleId":"643745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":643751,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

In this paper, a global-modeling technique is presented to characterize the millimeter-wave integrated-circuit amplifiers. The characterization of amplifier circuits, including the input and output matching networks, are performed using a full-wave analysis coupled with physical modeling of the semiconductor devices. The entire amplifier is simulated with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm, which also solves for the EM fields inside the transistor. The intensive computer-memory requirement and the large simulation time are reduced by applying a hybridization approach. The small signal as well as the large signal propagation through the amplifier circuit are demonstrated. The scattering parameters are extracted for the amplifier circuit at small and large signals for different frequencies. The global technique is able to model the nonlinearity and the harmonic distortion of the amplifier circuit. The third and fifth harmonic components in the output spectrum at large signal are predicted for different frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/22.643818","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.643818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14039","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14039/00643818.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global modeling of millimeter-wave circuits: electromagnetic simulation of amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643818/","displayDocTitle":"Global modeling of millimeter-wave circuits: electromagnetic simulation of amplifiers","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5812049","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global modeling of millimeter-wave circuits: electromagnetic simulation of amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00643818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04105S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"64","articleId":"643818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":643819,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsoo Koh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Dongsoo Koh","id":"37275581400"},{"name":"Hong-Bae Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hong-Bae Lee","id":"37615943300"},{"name":"T.

An interpolation scheme is proposed for communicating between the FDTD and FETD fields, which will not require the effort of fitting the FETD mesh to the FDTD cells in the interface region. This method is applied to calculate the scattering parameters of single and multiple cylindrical via holes in a microstrip structure. Applying FETD to the via-hole grounds and FDTD to the remaining region preserves the advantages of both FETD flexibility and FDTD efficiency.

A study has been carried out on devices from both MESFET (L/sub G/=0.5 /spl mu/m) and pseudomorphic high electron-mobility transistor (PHEMT) (L/sub G/=0.2 /spl mu/m) foundry processes, with total gatewidths between 60-1200 /spl mu/m. Results are presented, showing that at least up to medium-size devices, dc characteristics, and most of the bias-dependent small-signal circuit elements scale in general, very well provided a reliable parameter extraction methodology is implemented. However, in the case of dispersion phenomena, while the differential dc/ac transconductance obeys straightforward scaling rules, the output conductance does not. The main features of a general-purpose scaleable microwave FET model-COBRA-are described. This includes an equivalent circuit-based solution to account for dispersion effects. The solution is compact, obeys the required conservation constraints, and can \"absorb\" the scaling inconsistencies observed in the output conductance. The corresponding modeling methodology is also described. Finally, a comprehensive set of measurement versus simulation scalability test results are presented, including dc, small-signal, and large-signal tests.","doi":"10.1109/22.643826","startPage":"2248","endPage":"2255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14039/00643826.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.643826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable general-purpose model for microwave FETs including DC/AC dispersion effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scalability","PHEMTs","Microwave devices","Microwave circuits","MESFETs","Foundries","Parameter extraction","Transconductance","Microwave FETs","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave field effect transistors","Schottky gate field effect transistors","high electron mobility transistors","semiconductor device models","equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable general-purpose model","microwave FET","AC dispersion","DC dispersion","equivalent circuit","MESFET","PHEMT","COBRA","parameter extraction","transconductance","output conductance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A scalable general-purpose model for microwave FETs including DC/AC dispersion effects","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5812055","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable general-purpose model for microwave FETs including DC/AC dispersion effects","sourcePdf":"00643826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076692S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"79","articleId":"643826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":643830,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

The monobit receiver is a wide-band (1-GHz) digital receiver designed for electronic-warfare applications. The receiver can process two simultaneous signals and has the potential for fabrication on a single multichip module (MCM). The receiver consists of three major elements: a nonlinear RF front end, a signal sampler and formatting system (analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and demultiplexers), and a patented \"monobit\" algorithm implemented as an ASIC for signal detection and frequency measurement. The receiver's front end, ADC, and algorithm experimental performance results were previously presented. The receiver uses a 2-b ADC operating at 2.5 GHz whose outputs are collected and formatted by demultiplexers for presentation to the ASIC. The ASIC has two basic functions: to perform a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and to determine the number of signals and report their frequencies. The ASIC design contains five stages: the input, the FFT, the initial sort, the squaring and addition, and the final sort. The chip will process the ADC outputs in real time, reporting detected signal frequencies every 102.4 ns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14039/00643832.pdf","startPage":"2283","endPage":"2295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.643832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.643832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=643832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chip design for monobit receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chip scale packaging","Application specific integrated circuits","Signal processing","Signal detection","Wideband","Fabrication","Multichip modules","Radio frequency","RF signals","Analog-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","fast Fourier transforms","electronic warfare","radio receivers","frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip design","monobit receiver","ASIC","digital receiver","electronic warfare","MCM","nonlinear RF front end","signal sampler","monobit algorithm","instantaneous frequency measurement receiver","signal detection","fast Fourier transform","formatting system","analog-to-digital converter","demultiplexer","102.4 ns","1 GHz","2 bit","2.5 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/643832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Chip design for monobit receiver","volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5812060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chip design for monobit receiver","sourcePdf":"00643832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040884S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"37","articleId":"643832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":643837,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We propose a Genetic Algorithm providing a sequence that aims at initializing the highest number of flip flops with the lowest number of vectors. The experimental results show that the approach is feasible to be applied even to the largest benchmark circuits and that it compares well to other known approaches in terms of initialized flip flops and sequence length.

These array references follow a regular predictable memory pattern that can be analysed at compile time. This analysis can provide valuable information like the locality exhibited by the program, which can be used to implement more intelligent caching strategy. In this paper we propose a static locality analysis oriented to the management of data caches. We show that previous proposals on locality analysis are not appropriate when the proposals have a high conflict miss ratio. This paper examines those proposals by introducing a compile-time interference analysis that significantly improve the performance of them. We first show how this analysis can be used to characterize the dynamic locality properties of numerical codes. This evaluation show for instance that a large percentage of references exhibit any type of locality. This motivates the use of a dual data cache, which has a module specialized to exploit temporal locality, and a selective cache respectively. Then, the performance provided by these two cache organizations is evaluated. In both organizations, the static locality analysis is responsible for tagging each memory instruction accordingly to the particular type(s) of locality that it exhibits.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.1997.644022","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/5192/14034/00644022.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.1997.644022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static locality analysis for cache management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644022/","displayDocTitle":"Static locality analysis for cache management","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5781715","conferenceDate":"10-14 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static locality analysis for cache management","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00644022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026894S","chronDate":"10-14 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5192","citationCount":"15","articleId":"644022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":644025,"authors":[{"name":"K.

All errors caused by single stuck-at faults are detected using a parity-check code. The synthesis procedure (implemented in Stanford CRCs TOPS synthesis system) fully automates the design process, and reduces the cost of concurrent error detection compared with previous methods. An algorithm for selecting a good parity-check code for encoding the circuit outputs is described. Once the code has been selected, a new procedure called structure-constrained logic optimization is used to minimize the area of the circuit as much as possible while still using a circuit structure that ensures that single stuck-at faults cannot produce undetected errors. It is proven that the resulting implementation is path fault secure, and when augmented by a checker, forms a self-checking circuit. The actual layout areas required for self-checking implementations of benchmark circuits generated with the techniques described in this paper are compared with implementations using Berger codes, single-bit parity, and duplicate-and-compare. Results indicate that the self-checking multilevel circuits generated with the procedure described here are significantly more economical.","doi":"10.1109/43.644041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/14049/00644041.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.644041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic synthesis of multilevel circuits with concurrent error detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Logic synthesis of multilevel circuits with concurrent error detection","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","accessionNumber":"5796274","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic synthesis of multilevel circuits with concurrent error detection","sourcePdf":"00644041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061161S","chronDate":"Jul 1997","isNumber":"14049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"109","articleId":"644041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":644042,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

This basis is employed to: (1) derive lower bounds on the power dissipation in digital systems; and (2) unify existing power-reduction techniques under a common framework. The proposed basis is derived from information-theoretic arguments. In particular, a digital signal processing algorithm is viewed as a process of information transfer with an inherent information transfer rate requirement of R bits/s. Architectures implementing a given algorithm are equivalent to communication networks each with a certain capacity C (also in bits/s). The absolute lower bound on the power dissipation for any given architecture is then obtained by minimizing the signal power such that its channel capacity C is equal to the desired information transfer rate R. By including various implementation constraints, increasingly realistic lower bounds are calculated. The usefulness of the proposed theory is demonstrated via numerical calculations of lower bounds on power dissipation for simple static CMOS circuits. Furthermore, a common basis for some of the known power-reduction techniques such as parallel processing, pipelining and adiabatic logic is also provided.","doi":"10.1109/82.644047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/14050/00644047.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.644047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mathematical basis for power-reduction in digital VLSI systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical basis for power-reduction in digital VLSI systems","volume":"44","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5771916","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical basis for power-reduction in digital VLSI systems","sourcePdf":"00644047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090852S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"46","articleId":"644047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":644050,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Tai Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Tai Chang","id":"37350433000"},{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37292503700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"644050","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Very large scale integration","Signal processing algorithms","Systolic arrays","Hardware","Computer architecture","Clocks","Throughput","Digital signal processing","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","VLSI","systolic arrays","digital signal processing chips","digital arithmetic","matrix multiplication","mathematics computing","algorithm theory","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast DCT algorithm","systolic VLSI implementation","discrete cosine transform","hardware complexity reduction"]}],"abstract":"The authors present a new fast algorithm along with its systolic array implementation for computing the N-point discrete cosine transform (DCT), where N is a power of two.

The first approach has been studied more extensively since different ways of reducing motion vector candidates may result in significantly different performance; while the second and third approaches can in general be integrated into the first one so as to further accelerate the estimation process. In this paper, we first formulate the design of good fast estimation algorithms based on motion vector candidate reduction into an optimization problem that involves the checking point pattern (CPP) design via minimizing the distance from the true motion vector to the closest checking point (DCCP). Then, we demonstrate through extensive studies on the statistical behavior of real-world motion vectors that the DCCP minimization can result in fast search algorithms that are very efficient as well as highly robust. To further utilize the spatiotemporal correlation of motion vectors, we develop an adaptive search scheme and a hybrid search idea that involves a fixed CPP and a variable CPP. Simulations are performed to confirm their advantages over conventional fast search algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/76.644063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"833","endPage":"844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14051/00644063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.644063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of fast block motion estimation algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","HDTV","Acceleration","Design optimization","Minimization methods","Robustness","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Video codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","minimisation","video coding","search problems","adaptive estimation","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","fast block motion estimation algorithms","motion vector candidates","fast block-matching distortion computation","motion field subsampling","design","checking point pattern","closest checking point","statistical behavior","fast search algorithms","spatiotemporal correlation","adaptive search scheme","simulations","video codec"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of fast block motion estimation algorithms","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5792255","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644063/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of fast block motion estimation algorithms","sourcePdf":"00644063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04049S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"50","articleId":"644063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":644064,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Wook Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Wook Park","id":"37087308424"},{"name":"Jong Won Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, KongJu National University, Kongju, ChungNam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Won Kim","id":"37086967633"},{"name":"Sang Uk Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Uk Lee","id":"37087145007"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"644064","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":90,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":204},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Computer errors","Signal processing algorithms","Forward error correction","Streaming media","Equations","Computer simulation","Video compression","Transform coding","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","code standards","telecommunication standards","discrete cosine transforms","transform coding","error detection","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT coefficients recovery-based error concealment technique","MPEG-2 bit stream error","discrete cosine transform","smoothness constraint","image intensity","object function","intersample variations","lost block","adjacent blocks","linear equation","subequations","computational load","simpler hardware structure","performance","generic error concealment system","random bit errors","multistage error detection algorithm","computer simulation","recovered image"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel error concealment technique based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients recovery and its application to the MPEG-2 bit stream error. Assuming a smoothness constraint on image intensity, an object function which describes the intersample variations at the boundaries of the lost block and the adjacent blocks is defined, and the corrupted DCT coefficients are recovered by solving a linear equation. Our approach can be regarded as a special case of Wang et al.'s (1991). However, we show that the linear equation in the proposed algorithm can be decomposed into four independent subequations, requiring much lower computational load and simpler hardware structure than existing algorithms, while providing adequate performances. To develop a generic error concealment (EC) system, the blocks corrupted by the random bit errors are identified by a multistage error detection algorithm. Thus, the proposed EC system can be applied to more realistic environments, such as concealment of random bit error in MPEG-2 bit stream. Computer simulation results show that the quality of a recovered image is significantly improved even at a bit error rate as high as 10/sup -5/.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.644064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14051/00644064.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"854","doi":"10.1109/76.644064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCT coefficients recovery-based error concealment technique and its application to the MPEG-2 bit stream error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"DCT coefficients recovery-based error concealment technique and its application to the MPEG-2 bit stream error","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5792256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCT coefficients recovery-based error concealment technique and its application to the MPEG-2 bit stream error","sourcePdf":"00644064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038698S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"90","articleId":"644064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":644066,"authors":[{"name":"Jah-Ming Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jah-Ming Hsu","id":"37342412900"},{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37068528500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"644066","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644066","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Time domain analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative decoding","Hardware","HDTV","Computational complexity","Computer architecture","Clocks","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","digital signal processing chips","Reed-Solomon codes","time-domain analysis","error correction codes","decoding","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-efficient pipelined VLSI architecture","decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","time-domain algorithm","RS codes","communication systems","digital data","error protection","transmission process","special-purpose hardware structures","time domain algorithm","remainder decoding","t-error-correcting RS code","hardware complexity","latency"]}],"abstract":"Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have been widely used in a variety of communication systems to protect digital data against errors occurring in the transmission process. Since the decoding process for RS codes is rather computation-extensive, special-purpose hardware structures are often necessary for it to meet the real-time requirements. In this paper, an area-efficient pipelined very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture is proposed for RS decoding. The architecture is developed based on a time domain algorithm using the remainder decoding concept. A prominent feature of the proposed system is that, for a t-error-correcting RS code with block length n, it involves only 2t consecutive symbols to compute a discrepancy value in the decoding process, instead of n consecutive symbols used in the previous RS decoders based on the same algorithm without using the remainder decoding concept. The proposed RS decoder can process one data block every n clock cycles, i.e., the average decoding rate is one symbol per clock cycle. As compared to a similar pipelined RS decoder with the same decoding rate, it gains significant improvements in hardware complexity and latency.","doi":"10.1109/76.644066","startPage":"864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14051/00644066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.644066","endPage":"871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An area-efficient pipelined VLSI architecture for decoding of Reed-Solomon codes based on a time-domain algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"An area-efficient pipelined VLSI architecture for decoding of Reed-Solomon codes based on a time-domain algorithm","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5792258","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area-efficient pipelined VLSI architecture for decoding of Reed-Solomon codes based on a time-domain algorithm","sourcePdf":"00644066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054713S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","articleId":"644066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":644067,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The approach is compatible with the ITU-T video coding standard H.263. Fading situations in mobile networks are tolerated and the image quality degradation due to spatio-temporal error propagation is minimized utilizing a feedback channel between transmitter and receiver carrying acknowledgment information. In a first step, corrupted group of blocks (GOB's) are concealed to avoid annoying artifacts caused by decoding of an erroneous bit stream. The GOB and the corresponding frame number are reported to the transmitter via the back channel. The encoder evaluates the negative acknowledgments and reconstructs the spatial and temporal error propagation. A low complexity algorithm for real-time reconstruction of spatio-temporal error propagation is described in detail. Rapid error recovery is achieved by INTRA refreshing image regions (macroblocks) bearing visible distortion. The feedback channel method does not introduce additional delay and is particularly relevant for real-time conversational services in mobile networks. Experimental results with bursty bit error sequences simulating a Digital European Cordless Telephony (DECT) channel are presented with different combinations of forward error correction (FEC), automatic repeat on request (ARQ), and the proposed error compensation technique, Compared to the case where FEC and ARQ are used for error correction, a gain of up to 3 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is observed if error compensation is employed additionally.","doi":"10.1109/76.644067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/14051/00644067.pdf","startPage":"872","endPage":"881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.644067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standard compatible extension of H.263 for robust video transmission in mobile environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644067/","displayDocTitle":"Standard compatible extension of H.263 for robust video transmission in mobile environments","volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5792259","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standard compatible extension of H.263 for robust video transmission in mobile environments","sourcePdf":"00644067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049715S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"119","articleId":"644067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":644070,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

It is shown that the a-Si TFTs provide adequate current levels to drive the OLEDs at video brightness (/spl sim/100 cd/m/sup 2/).

Generally, the output network must present the drain with either an open or short circuit at the harmonic frequencies. At VHF and higher frequencies, the drain capacitance, lead inductance, lead length, and dispersion make implementation of reasonably ideal tuned circuits difficult. However it is possible to control the impedances at a finite number of harmonics. This note first derives the basic relationships among the Fourier coefficients of the waveforms and the performance of the amplifier. Fourier coefficients for maximally flat waveforms are then derived for inclusion of up to the fifth harmonic. Amplifier performance is then tabulated as a function of which harmonics are included in the voltage and current waveforms. Efficiency increases from 50% of class A toward 100% as harmonics are added.

By simplifying the parallel and series combinations of the overall equivalent circuit, the total input impedance looking from the feed line to the gap is analytically derived to predict the resonant frequencies. To verify the analysis, the resonant frequencies of the capacitively coupled ring resonator have been accurately measured, with the experimental results showing very good agreement with the theoretical predictions.","doi":"10.1109/22.644224","startPage":"2018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/14056/00644224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.644224","endPage":"2024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission-line analysis of a capacitively coupled microstrip-ring resonator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Transmission-line analysis of a capacitively coupled microstrip-ring resonator","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5763607","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission-line analysis of a capacitively coupled microstrip-ring resonator","sourcePdf":"00644224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038894S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"49","articleId":"644224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":644229,"authors":[{"name":"Heng-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Heng-Chia Chang","id":"37351246500"},{"name":"Xudong Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xudong Cao","id":"37348288600"},{"name":"M.J.

It is shown that the general behavior is qualitatively similar to a single injection-locked oscillator, with the output noise tracking the injected noise near the carrier, and returning to the free-running array noise far from the carrier, with intermediate behavior significantly influenced by the number of array elements and injection strength.

The mobile transmitted power is minimized while the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at each link is maintained above a threshold. A multitap transmit diversity scheme for the downlink is also proposed where the transmit weight vectors are adjusted such that the SNR at each mobile is greater than a threshold. The proposed transmit and receive diversity combining schemes can be applied to networks with fading channels and in cases where the number of cochannels and multipaths are larger than the number of antenna elements. The proposed algorithm achieves the optimal solution for the uplink that minimizes the mobile power, and achieves a feasible solution for the downlink if any exists.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

The maximum rate of such a code is upper bounded by the Shannon capacity 0.879. Unfortunately, the coding gain for MTR codes has not proven to be very significant since the distance benefit due to removing the dominant error-event barely makes up for the rate loss. In this paper, we describe a class of higher rate codes that eliminate the dominant high density error-event and provide improved coding gain. The new less restrictive constraints allow at most three consecutive transitions and have Shannon capacities as high as 0.925. Two high rate block codes with time-varying MTR constraints are presented. One code is rate 8/9 with block 9 and run-length constraint (d=0, k=11) and the other is rate 9/10 with block length 10 and (d=0, k=16).","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.644335","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

This paper discusses the pricing of services in a priority-based network by employing game-theoretic concepts. Given any price difference between services and an estimate of users' utility functions, we describe a method for predicting what users' service choices will be. In this fashion, service providers can determine what price ranges better encourage users to exhibit behavior that is mutually beneficial to users and providers. Under certain strict assumptions for the traffic characteristics and utility functions, necessary and sufficient conditions for the achievement of an optimal equilbrium are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644360/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5932016","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"3-8 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Equilibrium pricing in multi-service priority-based networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equilibrium pricing in multi-service priority-based networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00644360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029781S","chronDate":"3-8 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5002","citationCount":"12","articleId":"644360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":644369,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely-used self-similar process which can be characterized by the Hurst parameter. To gain a better understanding of queueing and network-related performance issues with regard to FBM models, it is essential to be able to accurately and quickly generate traffic from FBM processes. In the mean time, it is of crucial importance to accurately estimate the Hurst parameter. In this paper we attack the above two problems by using the wavelet transform. Our analysis indicates that the wavelet approach is as fast or faster than existing methods and appears to generate a closer approximation to true self-similar sample paths than the other known fast method (random midpoint displacement). Moreover, the Hurst parameter can also be accurately estimated from the power-law behaviour of the wavelet coefficients variance.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

This power control scheme compensates for fading above a certain cutoff fade depth: below the cutoff level an outage is declared. We assume a channel with fast Rayleigh fading and slow, log-normal shadowing, where truncated power control is applied to the shadowing and a RAKE receiver combines the Rayleigh fading multipath components separated by more than a chip time. We investigate the power gain as well as the capacity gain of this power control scheme relative to conventional power control as a function of the outage probability. We find that truncated power control significantly increases the capacity relative to conventional power control, since less power is wasted compensating for deep fading conditions. It is also found that truncated power control is most effective for channels with large power fluctuations or large background noise. We then apply truncated power control to multimedia systems, where different traffic types have different performance requirements (e.g. outage probability, bit error rate, information rate, etc.) For these systems truncated power control can significantly reduce the required transmit power for each traffic type. We conclude by examining the effects of estimation error. For a log-normally distributed estimation error we find that capacity is reduced by a factor of e/sup -(M+1//spl sigma//sub e//sup 2b2/2)/, where /spl sigma//sub e/ is the standard deviation of the error, M is the number of paths in the RAKE receiver, and b=ln 10/10.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.644382","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

In such systems, the accessing user can degrade the performance of existing users by introducing extra interference. We study how the transmit power should be varied with each successive access attempt so that the linear combination of average power expended and the average delay experienced by the accessing user is minimized. The harm caused by the accessing user to the existing communication links is also considered. We find that for all cost functions we consider, the absence of an access deadline implies that each access attempt should be made at some constant power.

Two algorithms making use of this knowledge and computing the amplitude for the transmitted signal in each chip interval, in order to decrease the average error probability, are given. Numerical results show that the maximum number of users simultaneously accessing the channel for a given error probability can be increased by employing any of these algorithms. In particular, the results for the more complex one are seen to be good also when the number of users exceeds the number of spreading chips per coded symbol, implying that more users can be supported using this algorithm than would be the case if the users were using orthogonal spreading sequences, even if the voice activity is not accounted for. Also, both algorithms are shown to be robust in the sense that they work properly for such different channel conditions as the AWGN channel and the flat Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.644386","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

As the demand for these services and the requirement for higher data rates and quality of service increases, the effects of the wideband mobile satellite propagation channel become more critical with respect to the overall system link budget. There is an increasing need to be able to accurately model the channel in order to optimise the design of radio mobile satellite systems. A wideband channel model has been developed based on the philosophy as the RACE ATDMA model. The model is of the tapped delay type, comprising a transversal filter structure with equidistant time shifted taps. The model parameters have been derived from the measurement campaign, and defined by a small number of discrete taps, where each tap is described by its complex time-varying amplitude including its statistical distribution and corresponding Doppler spectrum. A typical example is included of the tap amplitudes and statistical distributions from the measured data and the respective Doppler spectrum for the first tap (direct path) and the second tap (first multipath echo) in the model for the urban environment at 45/spl deg/ elevation angle. Additionally, the model has been validated against independent results published from the DLR measurement campaign.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19961173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14046","startPage":"12/1","endPage":"12/6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Propagation Aspects of Future Mobile Systems (Digest No: 1996/220)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5196/14046/00644445.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband channel model applicable to mobile satellite systems at L- and S-band","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25 Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A wideband channel model applicable to mobile satellite systems at L- and S-band","conferenceDate":"25-25 Oct. 1996","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5514099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband channel model applicable to mobile satellite systems at L- and S-band","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00644445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060686S","chronDate":"25 Oct 1996","isNumber":"14046","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5196","citationCount":"6","articleId":"644445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":644498,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The load /spl lambda//sub max/ of a set of lightpath requests is the maximum over all links of the number of lightpaths that use the link. At least /spl lambda//sub max/ wavelengths will be needed to assign channels to the lightpaths. If the network has full wavelength conversion capabilities then /spl lambda//sub max/ wavelengths are sufficient to perform the channel assignment. We propose ring networks with a fixed wavelength conversion capability within the nodes that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W-1, where W is the number of wavelengths in each link. We also propose ring networks with selective pairwise wavelength conversion capability within the nodes that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W. We also propose a star network with fixed wavelength conversion capability at its hub node that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W. We extend this result to tree networks and networks with arbitrary topologies. These results show that significant improvements in traffic-carrying capacity can be obtained in WDM network by providing a very limited wavelength conversion capability within the network.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.644498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14043","startPage":"489","endPage":"498 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/14043/00644498.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.644498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelength optical networks with limited wavelength conversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Optical wavelength conversion","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Optical fibers","Wavelength routing","Circuits","Asynchronous transfer mode","Milling machines","Rivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","network topology","telecommunication traffic","channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiwavelength optical networks","lightpaths","wavelength division multiplexed networks","limited wavelength conversion","WDM","channel assignment","ring networks","selective pairwise wavelength conversion","star network","fixed wavelength conversion","hub node","network topology","traffic-carrying capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelength optical networks with limited wavelength conversion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644498/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5912167","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelength optical networks with limited wavelength conversion","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00644498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0437S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"14043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"52","articleId":"644498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":644500,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Through traffic analysis, we have determined statistics and distributions for higher-level quantities such as the size of HTTP files, the number of files per \"Web page\", and user browsing behavior.

Foremost among them is the guarantee that other users will not interfere during a node's dedicated time slots. For this desirable isolation, the cost is synchronization. Viewing arbitrary time intervals as potential TDMA time slots, we ask whether it is possible to obtain some of the benefit of time division without incurring the synchronization cost. In particular, we address the question of whether a TDMA-like state can be induced on asynchronous channels in such a way as to reduce interference and energy consumption. Through analysis and simulation we find conditions under which it is desirable to use time division. We then show how autonomous power management may be used as a mechanism to induce a form of time division. In this context a backlog-sensitive power management system is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control and time division: the CDMA versus TDMA question","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.644515","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/14043/00644515.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"641 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.644515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Power control and time division: the CDMA versus TDMA question","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5912184","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control and time division: the CDMA versus TDMA question","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00644515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034485S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"14043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"3","articleId":"644515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":644516,"authors":[{"name":"X.H.

In this approach adjacent subnetworks can exchange wavelength sensitive traffic through bridges using wavelength non-selective devices which can be constructed using proven technologies. With photonic slot routing, packets sharing a common subnetwork destination are aggregated to form a photonic slot which is individually routed in order to reach the destination subnetwork. Photonic slots from different subnetworks can originate contentions at the bridge, leading to potential penalties of slot loss and retransmission. This paper shows how slot contention penalties can be reduced through the use of switched delay lines (SDL) at the bridges. The combination of these two innovative techniques, the photonic slot routing and the switched delay lines, leads to a unique solution that is shown to nearly achieve throughput and delay performance obtainable in absence of slot contentions.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644537","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WDM networks","Routing","Delay lines","Packet switching","Bridges","Optical packet switching","Local area networks","Optical filters","Wavelength division multiplexing","Telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","packet switching","optical delay lines","optical fibre LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable WDM network architecture","photonic slot routing","switched delay lines","all-optical packet switched networks","subnetworks","wavelength sensitive traffic","bridges","wavelength nonselective devices","packet routing","slot loss","slot retransmission","slot contention penalties reduction","throughput performance","delay performance","LAN"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4979/14043/00644537.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"776 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1997.644537","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1997.644537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable WDM network architecture based on photonic slot routing and switched delay lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644537/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable WDM network architecture based on photonic slot routing and switched delay lines","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5912200","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable WDM network architecture based on photonic slot routing and switched delay lines","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00644537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04643S","chronDate":"7-12 Apr 1997","isNumber":"14043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4979","citationCount":"8","articleId":"644537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":644560,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Schnaufer","affiliation":["Rockwell Collins Avionics, Cedar Rapids, IA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Schnaufer","id":"37370873700"},{"name":"W.K.

Aggregate voice or video traffic is modeled as a 2-state Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) while two models for aggregate data traffic, MMPP and Pareto-modulated Poisson process (PMPP), are used to examine the effects of traffic burstiness and long-range dependent behavior. Multiple-frequency time division multiple access (MF-TDMA) is used on the uplink in conjunction with a dynamic capacity allocation scheme. Higher priority is given to voice, and video realtime traffic to avoid delay variation. An on-board downlink queue for jitter-tolerant data is provided to achieve high statistical multiplexing gain. Simulation results show that packet loss due to the knockout contention scheme is much lower than that due to the limited capacity on the uplink and downlink. This makes the knockout architecture attractive for on-board switching to achieve low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1997.644567","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM 97.

By minimizing the frequency-domain error function and exploiting some of the properties of the functions and matrices associated with the design problem, a novel closed-form solution is developed. The solution is expressed in terms of the desired magnitude specifications and is eventually presented as an explicit expression for the impulse response of the filter to be designed, making a very fast evaluation of the filter's coefficients possible. It is also shown that when this solution is used to design filters that have centrosymmetric and quadrantally symmetric magnitude responses, some further computational savings can be achieved.

This paper examines the performance of Web servers under high CPU loads. Simulations are used in conjunction with workloads which were obtained by analyzing Web logs and performance data from several real sites. Performance is significantly affected by the percentage of requests for dynamic HTML pages; dynamic HTML pages adversely affect the server performance. In order to optimize the performance, the number of dynamic pages should be kept as low as possible. When dynamic pages are required, techniques such as fast APIs for invoking server programs and caching can be employed to keep the overhead of the server programs generating the dynamic pages as low as possible. When the server is operating at or near peak capacity, there is a trade-off between average latencies and the percentage of requests rejected; performance is improved by rejecting a higher percentage of requests. For the real request distributions which we encountered we found that Web servers should reject enough requests so that the average load on the system is 95% or less of the maximum capacity in order to prevent latencies from becoming too large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 Nov 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-8 Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5938849","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of Web server performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of Web server performance","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00644616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043928S","chronDate":"3-8 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5002","citationCount":"34","articleId":"644616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":644623,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Functional testing did not always reveal the GOSs so this method offers reliability testing against future failure since the GOSs can deteriorate during operation of the circuit. The GOSs were modeled by a diode and series resistance at various distances from the source. The breakdown voltages of the model diode significantly affected the responses and diagnostic accuracies. If they are in the expected practical range (/spl les/2 V) and are uniform in value, then by combining test results from both stimuli, accuracies of 100% are obtainable. If their values are variable or higher, the accuracies decrease, and the test reduces to a go/no go test. No test pins are required so the method is applicable to any circuit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Operational amplifiers","Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Diodes","SPICE","Current supplies","Multilayer perceptrons","Artificial neural networks","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit testing","SPICE","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient supply current","gate oxide short fault diagnosis","multilayer perceptron","CMOS operational amplifier transistor","SPICE simulation","artificial neural network","circuit testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/43.644623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/14069/00644623.pdf","startPage":"930","endPage":"935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.644623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of CMOS op-amps with gate oxide short faults using multilayer perceptrons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis of CMOS op-amps with gate oxide short faults using multilayer perceptrons","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644623/","volume":"16","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5817199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis of CMOS op-amps with gate oxide short faults using multilayer perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00644623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055035S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"14069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"1","articleId":"644623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":644628,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

From the analysis of the trap-generation kinetics, two types of trap generation closely related to holes have been identified. At the first stage of stress application, holes interact with the pre-existing structural origins of the neutral traps, then the neutral traps are generated. Influence of hole energy on this type of trap generation is also identified. After that, as holes pass, they also create the structural origins of the traps. The holes interact with these structural origins and the neutral traps are generated as a secondary effect. Thus, the increase in the neutral trap density shows up clearly with increase in the hole fluence. The stress-strength dependence of the increase in the neutral trap density can also be interpreted in terms of the influence of hole energy on the trap generation.","doi":"10.1109/16.644651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.644651","endPage":"2280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/14065/00644651.pdf","startPage":"2274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of holes on neutral trap generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644651/","displayDocTitle":"Influence of holes on neutral trap generation","volume":"44","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"5783526","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of holes on neutral trap generation","sourcePdf":"00644651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043099S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"17","articleId":"644651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":644652,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The weights are stored as floating-gate charge; they are nonvolatile, but can increase when we apply a row-learn signal. The input and learn signals are digital pulses; column input pulses that are coincident with row-learn pulses cause weight increases at selected synapses. The normalization circuitry forces row synapses to compete for floating-gate charge, bounding the weight values. The array simultaneously exhibits fast computation and slow adaptation: The inner product computes in 10 /spl mu/s, whereas the weight normalization takes minutes to hours.","doi":"10.1109/16.644652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/14065/00644652.pdf","startPage":"2281","endPage":"2289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.644652","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00644652.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A floating-gate MOS learning array with locally computed weight updates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A floating-gate MOS learning array with locally computed weight updates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644652/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5783517","volume":"44","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A floating-gate MOS learning array with locally computed weight updates","sourcePdf":"00644652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099375S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"41","articleId":"644652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":644655,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

Both circuit simulation and measurement results reveal a delayed but sharper kink effect as this resistance increases. The consequences of this effect are shown in the context of a simple amplifier configuration, resulting in severe bias-dependent degradation in the small signal gain characteristics as the body-tie resistance enters the M/spl Omega/ region.

In order to optimize the profile of the phase velocity, a simulated annealing algorithm has been developed and implemented into the NASA multidimensional large-signal coupled-cavity TWT computer model. This algorithm allows the determination of the lengths of the individual cavities at the end of the output section necessary to provide the optimized phase velocity profile. The resulting nonlinear computer-generated phase velocity profile provides a design with optimized RF efficiency.

This corresponds to a bit rate between 403.225 kbits/s and 98.425 kbits/s for BPSK modulation. We first characterize the delay profile of the channels and the envelope correlation between sensors from measured data. Then the performance obtained with two interference cancellation schemes are characterized. The first is based on eigenfiltering and the second is a classical single sensor least squares (LS) adaptive filter. The results shows that by using space-time processing, the performance is considerably increased in situations where the near-far problem is significant, and further that we can achieve a high data rate transmission in a small population of users scenario.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.644871","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/13984/00644871.pdf","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1112 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.644871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance enhancements for DS-CDMA receivers using space-path diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644871/","displayDocTitle":"Performance enhancements for DS-CDMA receivers using space-path diversity","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5958974","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance enhancements for DS-CDMA receivers using space-path diversity","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00644871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047126S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"2","articleId":"644871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":644883,"authors":[{"name":"L.

What should be done differently when an adjustable speed drive (ASD) is applied on these loads with high inertia? In this article, a method is established to calculate running torque, calculate starting/accelerating torque, and size the motor and the ASD appropriately.","doi":"10.1109/2943.644883","startPage":"27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/2943/14075/00644883.pdf","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2943.644883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644883/","displayDocTitle":"Starting high inertia loads on adjustable speed drives","volume":"4","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5817447","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Starting high inertia loads on adjustable speed drives","sourcePdf":"00644883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035706S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1998","isNumber":"14075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"7","articleId":"644883","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":644889,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The bandwidth of the signal used in this experiment is in excess of one GHz, which results in a multipath resolution of less than a nanosecond. The maximum likelihood (ML) detector, based on a specular multipath channel model, is derived to detect multipath components of the measured waveforms. The results show that typical received waveforms consist of a finite number of dominant multipath components. The number of dominant multipath components is equivalent to the number of single-path signal correlators required in a UWB RAKE receiver. The number of single-path signal correlators required to construct a filter matched to the received waveform, so that the constructed waveform adequately captures the average received signal energy, is a useful parameter for UWB RAKE receiver design. The quantity, energy capture, is defined mathematically for use as a performance measure of the ML detector. The energy capture as a function of the number of single-path signal correlators is evaluated for each of the experimentally measured received waveforms, and typical results are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/13984/00644973.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1281 vol.3","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.644973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.644973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=644973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy capture vs. correlator resources in ultra-wide bandwidth indoor wireless communications channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy capture","Correlators","Bandwidth","Maximum likelihood detection","Multipath channels","Detectors","Fading","Energy measurement","Energy resolution","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","maximum likelihood detection","correlators","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlator resources","indoor wireless communications channels","ultra-wide bandwidth channels","signal propagation experiment","modern office building","multipath resolution","maximum likelihood detector","ML detector","specular multipath channel model","multipath components detection","measured waveforms","received waveforms","single-path signal correlators","performance measure","filter","average received signal energy","RAKE receiver design","energy capture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/644973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Energy capture vs. correlator resources in ultra-wide bandwidth indoor wireless communications channels","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5965430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy capture vs. correlator resources in ultra-wide bandwidth indoor wireless communications channels","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00644973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033757S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"13984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"31","articleId":"644973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":644974,"authors":[{"name":"R.

While these deviations can be reduced to some degree by selecting optimal values of channel width, the associated penalties in dynamic and static power, and in packing density demand improved MOSFET structures aimed at minimizing parameter deviations.","doi":"10.1109/92.645063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/14072/00645063.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.645063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrinsic MOSFET parameter fluctuations due to random dopant placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Intrinsic MOSFET parameter fluctuations due to random dopant placement","volume":"5","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5785549","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645063/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrinsic MOSFET parameter fluctuations due to random dopant placement","sourcePdf":"00645063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043092S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"182","articleId":"645063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":645064,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) implementation, current scales as the square of transconductance. It is therefore important to distinguish current from transconductance in power estimation for high frequency oscillators. Analytical expressions relating current to steady-state amplitude are used in this paper to estimate the minimum power required for a crystal oscillator at a given frequency. A 78 MHz crystal oscillator is described, which forms part of a regulated system in a pager where the oscillation frequency is controlled digitally to sub-ppm accuracy.

Power can be reduced substantially without sacrificing performance in fixed-throughput applications by slowing the clock and lowering supply voltage instead of idling when computational workload varies. This can yield a typical power savings of 30-50%. If latency can be tolerated, buffering data and averaging processing rate can yield power reductions of an order of magnitude in some applications. Continuous variation of the supply voltage can be approximated by very crude quantization and dithering: a four-level controller is sufficient to get within a few percent of the optimal power savings. Significant savings are possible only if the voltage can be changed on the same time scale as the variations in workload. A chip has been fabricated and tested to verify the closed-loop functionality of a variable voltage system. The controller takes only 0.4 mm/sup 2/ and draws a maximum of 1 mW at 2 V with a 40 MHz clock.

A large portion of power dissipation in high performance CMOS VLSI is due to the inherent difficulties in global communication at high rates and we propose several approaches to address the problem. These techniques can be generalized at different levels in the design process. Global communication typically involves driving large capacitive loads which inherently require significant power. However, by carefully choosing the data representation, or encoding, of these signals, the average and peak power dissipation can be minimized. Redundancy can be added in space (number of bus lines), time (number of cycles) and voltage (number of distinct amplitude levels). The proposed codes can be used on a class of terminated off-chip board-level buses with level signaling, or on tristate on-chip buses with level or transition signaling.","doi":"10.1109/92.645071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/14072/00645071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.645071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14072","startPage":"444","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power encodings for global communication in CMOS VLSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-power encodings for global communication in CMOS VLSI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5779430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power encodings for global communication in CMOS VLSI","sourcePdf":"00645071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061624S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"134","articleId":"645071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":645118,"authors":[{"name":"Runhe Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"lastName":"Runhe Huang","id":"37087492206"},{"name":"Jianhua Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"lastName":"Jianhua Ma","id":"37087170263"},{"name":"D.F.

Scheduling of tasks onto networks of parallel processors is an interesting problem that is well-defined and documented in the literature. However, most of the available techniques are based on heuristics that solve certain instances of the scheduling problem very efficiently and in reasonable amounts of time. This paper investigates an alternative paradigm, based on genetic algorithms, that can be used to efficiently solve the scheduling problem without the need to apply any restricted assumptions that are problem-specific, such as is the case when using heuristics. The conditions under which a genetic algorithm performs best will also be highlighted. This will be accompanied by a number of examples and case studies.","doi":"10.1109/ISPAN.1997.645122","startPage":"369","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Networks (I-SPAN'97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Networks (I-SPAN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5134/13955/00645122.pdf","endPage":"375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPAN.1997.645122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"20-20 Dec. 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645122/","displayDocTitle":"An evolutionary approach for scheduling in parallel processor systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5816516","publicationDate":"1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolutionary approach for scheduling in parallel processor systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00645122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055206S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec 1997","isNumber":"13955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5134","citationCount":"1","articleId":"645122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":645128,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

This protocol is a subsidiary of the conventional cache-coherence protocol and is activated on a memory-block basis. If activated for a block, the exclusive copy of that block is frozen in the cache and is accessed (i.e., tampered) with no coherence transactions; otherwise, the coherency is maintained by the conventional protocol. Thus by activating the tampering protocol for the shared data of processes, the latency of communication between the processes reduces. As a by-product, the stream data are effectively implemented with the tampering protocol. The effects of the tampering protocol on the regular computations are evaluated by an RTL simulator of our multiprocessor. The result shows that the tampering protocol greatly improves the performance with a conventional protocol. Then the stream is effective for the process synchronization.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPAN.1997.645138","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Networks (I-SPAN'97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Networks (I-SPAN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5134/13955/00645138.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"471","doi":"10.1109/ISPAN.1997.645138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tampering protocol for reducing the coherence transactions in regular computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"A tampering protocol for reducing the coherence transactions in regular computation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-20 Dec. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5816532","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645138/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tampering protocol for reducing the coherence transactions in regular computation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00645138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030681S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec 1997","isNumber":"13955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5134","citationCount":"2","articleId":"645138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":645149,"authors":[{"name":"I.E.

In a sorting network approach, the presorting and path combination techniques are used to reduce the rank selector implementation.","doi":"10.1109/81.645149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/14074/00645149.pdf","startPage":"1114","endPage":"1121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.645149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Analog rank extractors","volume":"44","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5814364","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645149/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog rank extractors","sourcePdf":"00645149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043378S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"32","articleId":"645149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":645152,"authors":[{"name":"K.

If there exists a homoclinic orbit, the synchronization is broken down. We explain the synchronization mechanism and evaluate its robustness theoretically.

Previous work in this area has reported two distinct types of bifurcation paths, namely via regions of quasi-periodic orbits and period-doubling. This paper demonstrates that the two different types of bifurcation paths can, in fact, be viewed as part of another bifurcation in which the quasi-periodic sequence transmutes into the period-doubling sequence, and that such a bifurcation is observed regardless of the presence of the outer voltage feedback loop as long as a suitable set of bifurcation parameters is chosen. The describing iterative map is derived in closed form and is used to develop the main results via a series of computer experiments. The characteristic multipliers are calculated and the first onset of flip-bifurcation is predicted. Computer simulation based on an exact piecewise switched model confirms the predicted bifurcations. The exhibition of quasi-periodic orbits is confirmed by computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Finally, a series of return maps are generated to provide an alternative viewpoint to the reported bifurcations in terms of a transmutation from a tent-like map to a logistic-like map.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of bifurcations in current-programmed DC/DC boost converters: from quasiperiodicity to period-doubling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.645154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/14074/00645154.pdf","startPage":"1129","endPage":"1142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.645154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Study of bifurcations in current-programmed DC/DC boost converters: from quasiperiodicity to period-doubling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5814366","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of bifurcations in current-programmed DC/DC boost converters: from quasiperiodicity to period-doubling","sourcePdf":"00645154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030257S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"144","articleId":"645154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":645155,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The GA selected an adequate reference image from four images and searched adequate positions to template matching. We used cross correlation as similarity of template matching and as adaptation scales of individuals on GA. It was possible to detect 23 nodules from 45 that did not touch the lung walls, without consideration of their sizes. It was also possible to detect all nodules that touched the lung walls by using conventional template matching along lung walls. The total detection rate was approximately 67%.

The identification of structural models by using measured data is an important issue in engineering. Although static function mapping may be achieved using neural networks without knowing the fundamental physics of the system, dynamic model identification is still a challenging topic in neural network applications. A generalized neural network-based technique for structural dynamic model identification is developed based on the dynamics of structure. During the simulation study, structural response records from a 10-storey San Jose apartment building subjected to three different earthquakes are adopted for the dynamic model identification. For the experimental study, a series of experiments were conducted in which a designed scaled model structure, mounted on a shake table, was tested. The neural network is trained and examined using the measured structural responses under different earthquake loading conditions. It is shown that the trained neural network is capable of providing sensible outputs when presented with input data that has never been used during its training.","doi":"10.1109/IIS.1997.645205","startPage":"138","endPage":"142","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Intelligent Information Systems.

The authors adopt an oblique decision tree to represent the divided input space and select an appropriate subnetworks, each of which is trained over a different region of input space. The overall architecture of the multiple neural network system, called the federated architecture, consists of a facilitator, normal subnetworks, and \"tile\" networks. The role of a facilitator is to choose the subnetwork that is suitable for the given input data using information obtained from decision tree. However, if input data is close enough to the boundaries of regions, there is a large possibility of selecting the invalid subnetwork due to the incorrect prediction of decision tree. When such a situation is encountered, the facilitator selects a \"tile\" network that is trained closely to the boundaries of a partitioned input space, instead of a normal subnetwork. In this way, it is possible to reduce the large error of neural networks at zones close to borders of regions. Validation of the approach is examined and verified by applying the federated neural network system to the configuration design of a midship structure.","doi":"10.1109/IIS.1997.645210","startPage":"161","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Intelligent Information Systems.

The genetic algorithm is developed on the basis of experiences in solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Few heuristic improvements are added in order to prevent converging to local optima and to reduce the search space domain. To deal effectively with constraints of the problem and prune the search space of the GA in advance, the constraints are embedded in decimal coding of the problem. The proposed GA approach has been tested on several CVRP with different number of consumer nodes and different control parameters. The results of 144 node problem used for sensitivity analysis, reveal that the features of easy implementation, fast convergence, and near optimal solution in solving the CVRP can be achieved by the proposed GA approach.","doi":"10.1109/IIS.1997.645214","startPage":"184","endPage":"188","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Intelligent Information Systems.

The main circuit of this power converter is composed of a conventional single-phase PWM voltage source power converter and a ripple reduction circuit. The ripple reduction circuit is composed of an additional switching leg, an inductor and a switching leg that is shared with the PWM power converter. Input current control is achieved by the conventional high-frequency PWM current control technique. On the other hand, DC ripple reduction control is associated with some difficulties because one of the switching legs in the ripple reducing portion is shared with the PWM power converter portion. In order to reduce the DC ripple current, the inductor current at the ripple reducing portion must be maintained to an adequate value which is deeply influenced by the modulation factor on the PWM power converter. The relationship between the modulation factor and the inductor current was analysed and the inductor current necessary for DC ripple current reduction was studied. The effectiveness of this circuit was confirmed experimentally and by simulation The power converter is useful for UPSs and DC power supplies, particularly in the case in which batteries are connected to the DC line.","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.1997.645618","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Conversion Conference - PCC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power Conversion Conference - PCC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/5036/14041/00645618.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"240 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.1997.645618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC ripple current reduction method on a single phase PWM voltage source converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645618/","displayDocTitle":"DC ripple current reduction method on a single phase PWM voltage source converter","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5773232","conferenceDate":"6-6 Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC ripple current reduction method on a single phase PWM voltage source converter","confLoc":"Nagaoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00645618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107825S","chronDate":"3-6 Aug 1997","isNumber":"14041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5036","citationCount":"5","articleId":"645618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":645626,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Novel programmable Palmo circuits have been introduced which have low switching noise, low THD, and may be configured to perform many signal processing functions. An initial test chip has demonstrated the viability of the approach and aided in understanding the practical application of the technique. This has led to new ideas for the implementation of the Palmo building blocks to reduce THD and improve overall programmability and performance. Such circuits are ideal for field programmable analogue array (FPAA) cells. The new Palmo circuit blocks have a dedicated 6-bit current DAC and 3-bit programmable capacitor array giving 9 bits of programmability per cell. Cell interconnect to local neighbours or to pads further enhances programmability and high frequency performance. Dedicated static RAM is used to store the cell parameters and interconnect-which may also be dynamically reconfigured. A new improved comparator is under development to reduce harmonic distortion at high frequencies. These circuits are currently being designed and a new chip is to be fabricated in the near future.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19961252","publicationTitle":"IEE Third one-day Colloquium on Analog Signal Processing (Digest No: 1996/236)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Third one-day Colloquium on Analog Signal Processing (Digest No: 1996/236)","pdfPath":"/iel3/5202/14061/00645782.pdf","startPage":"5/1","endPage":"5/6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:19961252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Palmo analogue signal processing IC design techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20 Nov 1996","displayDocTitle":"Novel Palmo analogue signal processing IC design techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5527184","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-20 Nov. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Palmo analogue signal processing IC design techniques","confLoc":"Oxford, UK","sourcePdf":"00645782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021024S","chronDate":"20 Nov 1996","isNumber":"14061","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5202","citationCount":"4","articleId":"645782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":645792,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chieh Lee","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Chieh Lee","id":"37559401900"},{"name":"I.-C.K.

However, to achieve the desired prediction accuracy, existing dynamic branch predictors require considerable amounts of hardware to minimize the interference effects due to aliasing in the prediction tables. We propose a new dynamic predictor, the bi mode predictor, which divides the prediction tables into two halves and by dynamically determining the current \"mode\" of the program, selects the appropriate half of the table for prediction. This approach is shown to preserve the merits of global history based prediction while reducing destructive aliasing and, as a result, improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, it is simple enough that it does not impact a processor's cycle time. We conclude by conducting a comprehensive study into the mechanism underlying two level dynamic predictors and investigate the criteria for their optimal designs. The analysis presented provides a general framework for studying branch predictors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645792.pdf","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The bi-mode branch predictor","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645792","startPage":"4","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"The bi-mode branch predictor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645792/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5795106","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bi-mode branch predictor","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037949S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"49","articleId":"645792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":645797,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

The spatial locality detection table, introduced in this paper, facilitates the detection of spatial locality across adjacent cached blocks. Results from detailed simulations of several integer programs show significant speedups.

A microarchitecture organized around traces is presented as a means for efficiently executing many instructions per cycle. Trace processors exploit both control flow and data flow hierarchy to overcome complexity and architectural limitations of conventional superscalar processors by (1) distributing execution resources based on trace boundaries and (2) applying control and data prediction at the trace level rather than individual branches or instructions. Three sets of experiments using the SPECInt95 benchmarks are presented. (i) A detailed evaluation of trace processor configurations: the results affirm that significant instruction-level parallelism can be exploited in integer programs (2 to 6 instructions per cycle). We also isolate the impact of distributed resources, and quantify the value of successively doubling the number of distributed elements.

The motivation for the multicluster architecture is to reduce the clock cycle time, relative to a single-cluster architecture with the same number of hardware resources, by reducing the size and complexity of components on critical timing paths. Resource partitioning, however, introduces instruction-execution overhead and may reduce the number of concurrently executing instructions. To counter these two negative by-products of partitioning, we developed a static instruction scheduling algorithm. We describe this algorithm, and using trace-driven simulations of SPEC92 benchmarks, evaluate its effectiveness. This evaluation indicates that for the configurations considered the multicluster architecture may have significant performance advantages at feature sizes below 0.35 /spl mu/m, and warrants further investigation.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645806","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645806.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645806","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","startPage":"149","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The multicluster architecture: reducing cycle time through partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"The multicluster architecture: reducing cycle time through partitioning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645806/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795120","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The multicluster architecture: reducing cycle time through partitioning","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041228S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"124","articleId":"645806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":645809,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These caches are typically implemented with static RAM cells and often occupy a large portion of the chip area. Not surprisingly, these caches often consume a significant amount of power. In many applications, such as portable devices, low power is more important than performance. We propose to trade performance for power consumption by filtering cache references through an unusually small L1 cache. An L2 cache, which is similar in size and structure to a typical L1 cache, is positioned behind the filter cache and serves to reduce the performance loss. Experimental results across a wide range of embedded applications show that the filter cache results in improved memory system energy efficiency. For example, a direct mapped 256-byte filter cache achieves a 58% power reduction while reducing performance by 21%, corresponding to a 51% reduction in the energy-delay product over conventional design.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645809.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The filter cache: an energy efficient memory structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Clocks","Microprocessors","Energy consumption","Read-write memory","Power filters","Filtering","Performance loss","Delay","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","memory architecture","cache storage","performance evaluation","real-time systems","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filter cache","energy efficient memory structure","microprocessors","on-chip caches","static RAM","L1 cache","L2 cache","embedded applications","direct mapped 256-byte filter cache","power reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"The filter cache: an energy efficient memory structure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795123","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The filter cache: an energy efficient memory structure","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031489S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"244","articleId":"645809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":645810,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Two basic predictor models are defined: computational predictors perform an operation on previous values to yield predicted next values. Examples we study are stride value prediction (which adds a delta to a previous value) and last value prediction (which performs the trivial identity operation on the previous value). Context based predictors match recent value history (context) with previous value history and predict values based entirely on previously observed patterns. To understand the potential of value prediction we perform simulations with unbounded prediction tables that are immediately updated using correct data values. Simulations of integer SPEC95 benchmarks show that data values can be highly predictable. Best performance is obtained with context based predictors; overall prediction accuracies are between 56% and 91%. The context based predictor typically has an accuracy about 20% better than the computational predictors (last value and stride). Comparison of context based prediction and stride prediction shows that the higher accuracy of context based prediction is due to relatively few static instructions giving large improvements; this suggests the usefulness of hybrid predictors. Among different instruction types, predictability varies significantly. In general, load and shift instructions are more difficult to predict correctly, whereas add instructions are more predictable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The predictability of data values","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645815","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645815.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"The predictability of data values","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795129","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The predictability of data values","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03877S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"199","articleId":"645815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":645819,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Recent work has suggested that the limits imposed by data dependences can be overcome to some extent with the use of data value prediction. That is, when an instruction is fetched, its result can be predicted so that subsequent instructions that depend on the result can use this predicted value. When the correct result becomes available, all instructions that are data dependent on that prediction can be validated. This paper investigates a variety of techniques to carry out highly accurate data value predictions. The first technique investigates the potential of monitoring the strides by which the results produced by different instances of an instruction change. The second technique investigates the potential of pattern-based two-level prediction schemes. Simulation results of these two schemes show improvements over the existing method of predicting the last outcome. In particular, some benchmarks show improvement with the stride-based predictor and others show improvement with the pattern-based predictor. To do uniformly well across benchmarks, we combine these two predictors to form a hybrid predictor. Simulation analysis of the hybrid predictor shows its overall prediction accuracy to be better than that of the component predictors across all benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645819","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","startPage":"281","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly accurate data value prediction using hybrid predictors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Highly accurate data value prediction using hybrid predictors","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645819/","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795132","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly accurate data value prediction using hybrid predictors","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032445S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"145","articleId":"645819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":645821,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Periodic sampling of a processor's performance monitoring hardware is an effective, unobtrusive way to obtain detailed profiles. Unfortunately, existing hardware simply counts events, such as cache misses and branch mispredictions, and cannot accurately attribute these events to instructions, especially on out-of-order machines. We propose an alternative approach, called ProfileMe, that samples instructions. As a sampled instruction moves through the processor pipeline, a detailed record of all interesting events and pipeline stage latencies is collected. ProfileMe also supports paired sampling, which captures information about the interactions between concurrent instructions, revealing information about useful concurrency and the utilization of various pipeline stages while an instruction is in flight. We describe an inexpensive hardware implementation of ProfileMe, outline a variety of software techniques to extract useful profile information from the hardware, and explain several ways in which this information can provide valuable feedback for programmers and optimizers.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645821","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645821.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","startPage":"292","endPage":"302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ProfileMe: hardware support for instruction-level profiling on out-of-order processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ProfileMe: hardware support for instruction-level profiling on out-of-order processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645821/","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795133","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ProfileMe: hardware support for instruction-level profiling on out-of-order processors","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032247S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"95","articleId":"645821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":645830,"authors":[{"name":"Chunho Lee","affiliation":["The Departments of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"lastName":"Chunho Lee","id":"37367281600"},{"name":"M.

The vast majority of ILP compilation research has been conducted in the context of general-purpose computing, and more specifically the SPEC benchmark suite. At the same time, a number of microprocessor architectures have emerged which have VLIW and SIMD structures that are well matched to the needs of the ILP compilers. Most of these processors are targeted at embedded applications such as multimedia and communications, rather than general-purpose systems. Conventional wisdom, and a history of hand optimization of inner-loops, suggests that ILP compilation techniques are well suited to these applications. Unfortunately, there currently exists a gap between the compiler community and embedded applications developers. This paper presents MediaBench, a benchmark suite that has been designed to fill this gap. This suite has been constructed through a three-step process: intuition and market driven initial selection, experimental measurement to establish uniqueness, and integration with system synthesis algorithms to establish usefulness.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multimedia communication","Multimedia systems","Computer architecture","Application software","Parallel processing","Microprocessors","VLIW","Program processors","Pipeline processing","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia systems","program compilers","parallel programming","instruction sets","microprogramming","parallel architectures","program control structures","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MediaBench","multimedia systems","communications systems","compilation technology","instruction-level parallelism","general-purpose computing","SPEC benchmark suite","microprocessor architectures","VLIW","SIMD","embedded applications","general-purpose systems","optimization","inner-loops","benchmark suite","experimental measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=645830","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1997.645830","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel3/5206/14079/00645830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1997.645830","startPage":"330","endPage":"335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14079","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 30th Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MediaBench: a tool for evaluating and synthesizing multimedia and communications systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MediaBench: a tool for evaluating and synthesizing multimedia and communications systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","conferenceDate":"3-3 Dec. 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5795137","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MediaBench: a tool for evaluating and synthesizing multimedia and communications systems","confLoc":"Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00645830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037356S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206","citationCount":"580","articleId":"645830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":645842,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The second approach is based on implementing Boolean functions for which the classical Shannon's decomposition can be used. Such a solution has already been used by Alon-Bruck (1991) to prove bounds on neural networks with fan-ins limited to 2. We generalise the result presented there to arbitrary fan-in, and prove that the size is minimised by small fan-in values, while relative minimum size solutions can be obtained for fan-ins strictly lower than linear.

This paper presents some results achieved by using this technique to search optimal neural architectures to solve real world credit analysis problems. In this paper the searches have been restricted to multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks which are feedforward fully-connected strictly-layered architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645849/","accessionNumber":"5795306","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary design of MLP neural network architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary design of MLP neural network architectures","confLoc":"Goiania, Brazil","sourcePdf":"00645849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054235S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5205","citationCount":"6","articleId":"645849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":645850,"authors":[{"name":"H.V.

Uninterruptible power systems have incorporated battery technology to allow smooth power feeding switch-over in the case of a power failure. In such systems lead-acid batteries have commonly been used until generators come online or for safe computer shutdown. A new battery system, the vanadium redox battery is under development at the University of New South Wales, Australia, which provides many advantages over conventional batteries for emergency back-up applications. This system stores all energy in the form of liquid electrolytes which are recirculated around the battery system. The electrolytes can be recharged an indefinite number of times, or the system can be instantly recharged by mechanically exchanging the discharged solution with recharged solution. A vanadium battery emergency back-up system has been designed and tested for operation between a restricted voltage operating range of 22-28 V. The system achieved energy efficiencies above 80% and coulombic and voltage efficiencies as high as 96.4% and 92.2% respectively depending on the load. The system demonstrated excellent performance characteristics with a capacity utilisation up to 94% of theoretical values.","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.1997.645928","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power and Energy Systems in Converging Markets","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Power and Energy Systems in Converging Markets","pdfPath":"/iel3/5207/14087/00645928.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.1997.645928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The vanadium redox battery for emergency back-up applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/645928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"The vanadium redox battery for emergency back-up applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5801504","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-23 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The vanadium redox battery for emergency back-up applications","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"00645928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030611S","chronDate":"19-23 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5207","citationCount":"28","articleId":"645928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":646032,"authors":[{"name":"M.

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video OCR for digital news archive","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 IEEE International Workshop on Content-Based Access of Image and Video Database","doi":"10.1109/CAIVD.1998.646033","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 IEEE International Workshop on Content-Based Access of Image and Video Database","pdfPath":"/iel3/5211/14091/00646033.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAIVD.1998.646033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3 Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Video OCR for digital news archive","conferenceDate":"3-3 Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5823099","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video OCR for digital news archive","confLoc":"Bombay, India","sourcePdf":"00646033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038667S","chronDate":"3 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211","citationCount":"129","articleId":"646033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":646059,"authors":[{"name":"T.

For any fixed c>1 and any set of n nodes in the plane, the new scheme finds a (1+1/c)-approximation to the optimum traveling salesman tour in O(n(logn)/sup O(c)/) time. (Our earlier scheme ran in n/sup O(C)/ time.) For points in R/sup d/ the algorithm runs in O(n(logn)/sup (O(/spl radic/dc)/d-1)) time. This time is polynomial (actually nearly linear) for every fixed c, d. Designing such a polynomial-time algorithm was an open problem (our earlier algorithm (1996) ran in superpolynomial time for d/spl ges/3). The algorithm generalizes to the same set of Euclidean problems handled by the previous algorithm, including Steiner Tree, /spl kappa/-TSP, /spl kappa/-MST, etc, although for /spl kappa/-TSP and /spl kappa/-MST the running time gets multiplied by /spl kappa/.

This approach leads to twin requirements for useful inverse solutions: accuracy, defined in a physiologically meaningful (and not just averaged and mathematical) sense, and reliability, not only to measurement noise but also to geometric modeling errors and other uncertainties that are inescapable in practical application. Studies using analytically tractable models may still be relevant, but it seems more important to find solutions to practical inverse problems, which will move the field toward wider acceptance and credibility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent progress in inverse problems in electrocardiology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/51.646224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/51/14099/00646224.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.646224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Recent progress in inverse problems in electrocardiology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5824493","pubMedId":"9460623","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent progress in inverse problems in electrocardiology","sourcePdf":"00646224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130773S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"100","articleId":"646224","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":646233,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

One methodology includes various resonance-based approaches, whereby the Singularity Expansion Method (SEM) parameters are estimated by some method, often a Prony or Maximum Likelihood approach. The natural resonance approach is very appealing for two reasons: firstly, SEM theory states that the natural resonances are invariant with target aspect angle and polarization. For application to land mines, this is appealing since the mines are probably oriented randomly. Secondly, one need store only a limited number of identification parameters in a library for each object. It is for these reasons that we have chosen to investigate the natural resonance approach, as applicable to an impulse ground penetrating radar (GPR). We have restricted the scope of the paper to a subset of conducting bodies of revolution (BOR). In particular, we seek to decide if the radar return from a buried BOR is either a \"Cylinder Class\" or a \"Cone Class\". From the perspective of land mine classification, the cylinder could represent a mine, and the cone a nonhazardous object. The methods described are applicable to a wideband incident waveform (or stepped frequency waveform) which excites natural resonance modes of the BOR. Exact resonance parameters of canonical BOR have been calculated by S.R. Vechinski (1989), and those results are used in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646370/","accessionNumber":"5444238","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of system identification and neural networks to classification of land mines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of system identification and neural networks to classification of land mines","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"00646370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02037S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct 1996","isNumber":"14097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5215","citationCount":"1","articleId":"646370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":646373,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Rowe","affiliation":["King''s College, UK"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Rowe"},{"name":"J.A.S.

The frequencies of these signals lie between 0.5 and 6 MHz; they are characteristic of a given explosive and provide not only a positive identification but also an estimate of quantity or depth. Unlike the better known technique of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), no static magnetic field is needed, so that portable probes can be used. Furthermore, signals are only seen in solids or solid-like materials, and because of the highly compound-specific nature of NQR frequencies, there is little, if any interference from other nitrogen-containing materials which may be present in the mine casing or the surrounding terrain. The paper discusses the principles of NQR and experimental methods, and its application to mine detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"EUREL International Conference The Detection of Abandoned Land Mines: A Humanitarian Imperative Seeking a Technical Solution (Conf.

Tools were developed when not available (particularly in support of low energy design), as well as an interface to mechanical designers who created a custom injection molded case.

We reformulate noise-shaping modulation alternatively as a nonlinear optimal control problem, where the objective is to find the binary modulation sequence that minimizes signal swing in a cascade of integrators operating on the difference between the input signal and the modulation sequence. We use reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize a nonlinear neural classifier which outputs modulation bits from the values of the input signal and integration state variables. Analogous to the classical pole balancing control problem, a punishment signal triggers learning whenever any of the integrators saturate. We train a simple classifier consisting of locally tuned, binary address encoded neurons to produce stable noise shaping modulation, and present experimental results obtained from analog VLSI modulators of orders one and two. The integrated classifier contains an array of 64 neurons trained on-chip with a simplified variant on reinforcement learning.","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.1998.646595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVD.1998.646595","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eleventh International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eleventh International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/5220/14112/00646595.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Design and VLSI implementation of an adaptive delta-sigma modulator","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5877035","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and VLSI implementation of an adaptive delta-sigma modulator","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"00646595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05916S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5220","articleId":"646595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":646609,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We show that all path delay faults that can affect the rated-clock operation of the circuit are testable by the variable-clock method. Also, all path delay faults that are untestable by the variable-clock method are, in fact, untestable by the rated-clock method. However, some faults tested by the variable-clock method may be incapable of affecting the rated-clock operation. Our study is based on a finite-state machine model in which fault-free transitions are shown by green arcs. Faulty transitions are shown by red arcs. A test traverses successive arcs until a faulty output occurs. A variable-clock test can exercise more flexibility in selecting from green and red arcs. It can cover all functional paths, but may find only a proper subset of untestable paths. Our analysis assumes a delay fault, consisting of either a singly-testable path or multiply-testable paths, and hence corresponds to non-robust detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan 1998","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5877044","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Path delay testing: variable-clock versus rated-clock","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path delay testing: variable-clock versus rated-clock","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"00646651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051011S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5220","citationCount":"7","articleId":"646651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":646654,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper explores the avenue of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for a holistic view for synthesis of Finite State Machine (FSM). Two aspects-state assignment and choice of sequential elements-significantly affect the cost of the combinational logic synthesized for a FSM. While the state assignment strategies reported in the literature target a specific type of sequential element (generally, a D flip-flop), this paper chooses a combination of available flip-flops to yield the best result. Thus the problems of state assignment and flip-flop selection have been integrated into a single genetic algorithmic formulation. Exhaustive experimentation done on a large suite of benchmarks have established the fact that on the average this tool outperforms the two level state assignment algorithm NOVA by more than 300%. The quality of the solution obtained and the high rate of convergence has established the effectiveness of the GA in solving this particular NP-complete problem. Further, the inherent parallelism of GA makes the proposed scheme ideal for solving the problem in a multiprocessor environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646659/","accessionNumber":"5877052","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based approach for integrated state assignment and flipflop selection in finite state machine synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based approach for integrated state assignment and flipflop selection in finite state machine synthesis","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"00646659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026851S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5220","citationCount":"8","articleId":"646659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":646689,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

In Doppler spread fading, the proposed system performance exhibits an irreducible bit error probability (BEP) even for the single user case. Dramatic performance improvements can be realized with the use of an ideal maximal ratio combiner (MRC). A system utilizing an equal gain combiner (EGC) is analyzed. Finally, we compare the analytic results with the results from several computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646689","startPage":"587","endPage":"591 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14093/00646689.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSSS/MCM system performance in a Doppler spread channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","System performance","Fading","Bandwidth","Error probability","Frequency","Multipath channels","Transmitters","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Springs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","Doppler broadening","differential phase shift keying","diversity reception","fading","error statistics","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler spread channel","direct sequence spread spectrum","multicarrier modulation","functionality","branch combiner","receiver","performance","Doppler spread fading","bit error probability","maximal ratio combiner","equal gain combiner"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"DSSS/MCM system performance in a Doppler spread channel","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5958910","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSSS/MCM system performance in a Doppler spread channel","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00646689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072039S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"6","articleId":"646689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":646692,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

A transmitter encodes the data, in a product code (PC), and transmits it in a slow frequency-hopped spread-spectrum (FHSS) system. A hostile jammer attempts to block correct packet reception by adjusting the fraction of the total band in which it distributes the jam power, /spl rho/. Two cases are considered. In the first case, the transmitter declares his strategy and the jammer uses this information to select his best jamming fraction. In the second case, the jammer declares his strategy first and the transmitter uses this information to select his best rates.

It is shown that the performance of the system is better than that of the conventional decorrelator and that the performance gain over the conventional decorrelator system increases as the number of active users and number of antenna arrays increase.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646729","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14093/00646729.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"802 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suboptimum multiuser detection of the QS-CDMA systems using antenna array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646729/","displayDocTitle":"Suboptimum multiuser detection of the QS-CDMA systems using antenna array","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5952726","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suboptimum multiuser detection of the QS-CDMA systems using antenna array","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00646729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0362S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"2","articleId":"646729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":646734,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

A military scenario is considered in which the processing gain is very large compared with the number of users. Also, communications is peer-to-peer so that power control cannot be used to solve the near-far problem. Two subspace techniques are considered. The first projects the received vectors on to an estimated signal subspace obtained by an appropriate eigen-decomposition. The second partially despreads the received signal. The dimension of the lower-dimensional subspace affects both the minimum mean squared error, and the response time to interference transients. There is a tradeoff between these two quantities which determines the optimum choice of dimension. This is illustrated numerically for a particular model in which the interferers turn on and off according to a two-state Markov chain. Simulation results are also presented which show that recursively updated algorithms are much more sensitive to large interference transients than block-oriented adaptive filtering algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646737","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14093/00646737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14093","startPage":"836","endPage":"840 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of subspace adaptive filtering techniques for DS-CDMA interference suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of subspace adaptive filtering techniques for DS-CDMA interference suppression","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646737/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5952734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of subspace adaptive filtering techniques for DS-CDMA interference suppression","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00646737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027245S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"18","articleId":"646737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":646741,"authors":[{"name":"Seoyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Seoyoung Lee","id":"37736097900"},{"name":"J.

The MMSE receivers are near-far resistant in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. But the noise in many communication channels is non-Gaussian and impulsive. Symmetric alpha-stable (SaS) probability density functions can accurately model large classes of impulsive noise. For a SaS process with 0</spl alpha/<2, the MMSE performance criterion cannot be used since the noise process has infinite variance. This paper considers the problem of adaptive multiple-access interference (MAI) suppression in SaS non-Gaussian impulsive noise channels to combat the near-far problem. The receiver uses the minimum dispersion (MD) criterion to suppress interference. The receiver is implemented adaptively using least mean p-norm (LMP) algorithm. We investigate the performance of the MD receiver. The simulation results indicate that the proposed receiver is less sensitive to the near-far problem. The adaptive MD receiver shows good near-far resistance in non-Gaussian impulsive noise channels modeled as SaS processes.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646741","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14093/00646741.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14093","startPage":"857","endPage":"861 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive minimum dispersion interference suppression for DS/CDMA systems in non-Gaussian impulsive channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive minimum dispersion interference suppression for DS/CDMA systems in non-Gaussian impulsive channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646741/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5952738","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive minimum dispersion interference suppression for DS/CDMA systems in non-Gaussian impulsive channels","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00646741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04302S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"2","articleId":"646741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":646742,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The advantage of the multicarrier CDMA system for quasi-synchronous operation is that the timing uncertainty interval can be progressively decreased by increasing the number of carriers and bits in the serial-to-parallel buffer. It has previously been shown that a modified decorrelator based on chip matched filter samples completely rejects undesired users with delays falling in the quasi-synchronous uncertainty interval. Here, it is also shown that the decorrelator rejects adjacent carrier undesired users, in contrast to the case of a system employing conventional matched filtering.

However, a robust stealth system is proposed. That is, the system has no guard-time and a high spreading factor (low data rate). A guard-time would simplify hostile detection of the transmitted signal. Finally, a Gaussian scrambler is tested.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14093/00646776.pdf","startPage":"1046","endPage":"1051 vol.2","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.646776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband multi-carrier transmission for military HF communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Military communication","Hafnium","OFDM modulation","Bandwidth","Fading","Distortion","Frequency division multiplexing","Intersymbol interference","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military communication","frequency division multiplexing","differential phase shift keying","intersymbol interference","Gaussian noise","encoding","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband multi-carrier transmission","military HF communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation","commercial OFDM systems","differential binary PSK","cyclic extension","intersymbol interference","ISI removal","high data rates","robust stealth system","high spreading factor","low data rate","hostile detection","transmitted signal","Gaussian scrambler","DBPSK","coding","multipath parameters","AWGN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Wideband multi-carrier transmission for military HF communication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5958962","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband multi-carrier transmission for military HF communication","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00646776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036367S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"25","articleId":"646776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":646798,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method is based on an analysis of the geometrical-optics field transformation in the displaced-axis two-reflector arrangement. The principal difference of the displaced-axis antenna from the Cassegrain/Gregory two-reflector antenna is pointed out. While decreasing the level of illumination of the subreflector edge in the Cassegrain/Gregory antenna leads to decreasing the sidelobe levels, and, respectively, the efficiency of the antenna system, in the displaced-axis antenna, decreasing the level of illumination of the subreflector leads to an increased level of sidelobes and an essentially nonuniform amplitude distribution in the aperture. The aperture-amplitude-distribution dependence of the illumination level of the subreflector edge in displaced-axis antennas is much stronger than in Cassegrain/Gregory antennas.","doi":"10.1109/74.646802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.646802","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/14102/00646802.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude aperture-distribution control in displaced-axis two-reflector antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude aperture-distribution control in displaced-axis two-reflector antennas","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5833840","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646802/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude aperture-distribution control in displaced-axis two-reflector antennas","sourcePdf":"00646802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025651S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"6","articleId":"646802","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":646858,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Recently, a new method (Fourier method) was developed with limited diffraction beams for image construction. With the method and a single plane wave transmission, both 2D (two-dimensional) and 3D (three-dimensional) images of a very high frame rate (up to 3750 frames/s for a depth of 200 mm in biological soft tissues) and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be constructed with relatively simple and inexpensive hardware. If limited diffraction beams of different parameters are used in both transmission and reception and transducer aperture is shaded with a cosine function, high-resolution and low-sidelobe images can be constructed with the new method without montage of multiple frames of images [the image quality is comparable to that obtained with a transmit-receive (two-way) dynamically focused imaging system]. In this paper, the Fourier method was studied with both experiment and computer simulation for 2D B-mode imaging. In the experiment, two commercial broadband 1D array transducers (48 and 64 elements) of different aperture sizes (18.288 and 38.4 mm) and center frequencies (2.25 and 2.5 MHz) were used to construct images of different viewing sizes. An ATS539 tissue-equivalent phantom of an average frequency-dependent attenuation of 0.5 dB/MHz/cm was used as a test object. To obtain high frame rate images, a single plane wave pulse (broadband) was transmitted with the arrays. Echoes received with the arrays were processed with both the Fourier and conventional dynamic focusing (delay-and-sum) methods to construct 2D B-mode images. Results show that the quality (resolution and contrast) of constructed images is virtually identical for both methods, except that the Fourier method is simpler to implement. Both methods have also a similar sensitivity to phase aberration distortions. Excellent agreement among theory, simulation, and experiment was obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","volume":"45","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5826401","pubMedId":"18244161","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study of high frame rate imaging with limited diffraction beams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study of high frame rate imaging with limited diffraction beams","sourcePdf":"00646914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084812S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"113","articleId":"646914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":646915,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The number of beam lines scanning the image plane for a given transmit-receive subaperture combination is chosen according to the spatial sampling criteria for that combination. On each beam line, echo signals over the entire array are collected through electronic multiplexing of array channels, where the transmit subaperture at the transducer center is fired K successive times, with K equal to the number of nonoverlapping receive subapertures. For every receive subaperture, the number of beam lines is increased through digital interpolation using a linear filter with spatial frequency band associated with the subaperture. Interpolated beam lines from all receive subapertures are then added to obtain a high resolution sector image. The efficiency of subaperture processing for different system configurations is tested on experimental rf data acquired from two different phantoms using a 3.5 MHz, 128-element transducer array. The proposed subaperture processing reduces the number of firings for data acquisition, and thus allows real-time imaging with very low susceptibility to motion artifacts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14106/00646917.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.646917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.646917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=646917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subaperture processing for ultrasonic imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Interpolation","Transducers","Apertures","Signal synthesis","Image sampling","Signal sampling","Digital filters","Nonlinear filters","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","medical image processing","interpolation","biomedical ultrasonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical ultrasonic imaging","subaperture processing","electronic multiplexing","array channels","nonoverlapping receive subapertures","data acquisition","real-time imaging","motion artifacts","experimental rf data","medical diagnostic imaging","beam line","echo signals","spatial sampling criteria","beam space interpolation","3.5 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Subaperture processing for ultrasonic imaging","volume":"45","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5826404","pubMedId":"18244164","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subaperture processing for ultrasonic imaging","sourcePdf":"00646917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038547S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"60","articleId":"646917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":646920,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The 2.5 MHz element was used as the transmitter and the 5.0 MHz element was used as the receiver. At 0.68 cm in front of the geometric focal point of the transducer, the phantom contained a 0.6 cm diameter cylindrical volume which contained no scatterers. Each of these r-f signals was then processed to produce the corresponding fundamental (2.5 MHz-centered) and second harmonic (5.0 MHz-centered) envelopes. The contrast resolution obtained for the scatterer-free or cyst region of the envelopes was compared against the computed prediction and good agreement was obtained.

In strain imaging, companding is applied to warp 2-D or 3-D ultrasonic echo fields to improve coherence between data acquired before and after compression. It minimizes decorrelation errors, which are the dominant source of strain image noise. The word refers to a spatially variable signal scaling that compresses and expands waveforms acquired in an ultrasonic scan plane or volume. Temporal stretching by the applied strain is a single-scale (global), 1-D companding process that has been used successfully to reduce strain noise. This paper describes a two-scale (global and local), 2-D companding technique that is based on a sum-absolute-difference (SAD) algorithm for blood velocity estimation. Several experiments are presented that demonstrate improvements in target visibility for strain imaging.

The new technique improves lateral resolution beyond the focus of the transducer by considering the focus a virtual element and applying synthetic aperture focusing techniques. In this paper, the use of the focus as a virtual element is examined, considering the issues that are of concern when imaging with an array of actual elements: the tradeoff between lateral resolution and sidelobe level, the tradeoff between system complexity (channel count/amount of computation) and the appearance of grating lobes, and the issue of signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the processed image. To examine these issues, pulse-echo RF signals were collected for a tungsten wire in degassed water, monofilament nylon wires in a tissue-mimicking phantom, and cyst targets in the phantom. Results show apodization lowers the sidelobes, but only at the expense of lateral resolution, as is the case for classical synthetic aperture imaging. Grating lobes are not significant until spatial sampling is more than one wavelength, when the beam is not steered. Resolution comparable to the resolution at the transducer focus can be achieved beyond the focal region while obtaining an acceptable SNR. Specifically, for a 15-MHz focused transducer, the 6-dB beamwidth at the focus is 157 /spl mu/m, and with synthetic aperture processing the 6-dB beamwidths at 3, 5, and 7 mm beyond the focus are 189 /spl mu/m, 184 /spl mu/m, and 215 /spl mu/m, respectively. The image SNR is 38.6 dB when the wire is at the focus, and it is 32.8 dB, 35.3 dB, and 38.1 dB after synthetic aperture processing when the wire is 3, 5, and 7 mm beyond the focus, respectively. With these experiments, the virtual source has been shown to exhibit the same behavior as an actual transducer element in response to synthetic aperture processing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646925/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","volume":"45","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"5826412","pubMedId":"18244172","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic aperture techniques with a virtual source element","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic aperture techniques with a virtual source element","sourcePdf":"00646925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033672S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"200","articleId":"646925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":646927,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

However, these characteristics are difficult to achieve at frequencies greater than 30 MHz using conventional array construction methods. Optical schemes offer a solution. Focused laser beams incident on a suitable surface can generate and detect acoustic radiation. Precisely controlling the position and size of the beams defines points of transmission and detection, making it possible for pulse-echo image formation by synthetic aperture methods. An optical detection array was built, relying on a conventional piezoelectric transducer as an ultrasound source. The detection system, with near optimal resolution over a wide depth of field, demonstrates the potential for high frequency array implementation using optical techniques. A possible application is in pathology, where 2-D or 3-D fine resolution pulse-echo imaging can be performed in situ without the need for biopsies.","doi":"10.1109/58.646927","startPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel3/58/14106/00646927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.646927","endPage":"235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frequency ultrasound imaging with optical arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/646927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"High frequency ultrasound imaging with optical arrays","volume":"45","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5826414","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","pubMedId":"18244174","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frequency ultrasound imaging with optical arrays","sourcePdf":"00646927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043402S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"46","articleId":"646927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":646955,"authors":[{"name":"Ju Yong Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ju Yong Park","id":"38256839800"},{"name":"Ki Dong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki Dong Lee","id":"38185598100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4076-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"646955","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cleaning","Mobile robots","Defense industry","Manufacturing industries","Service robots","Medical robotics","Flexible manufacturing systems","Manufacturing processes","Manufacturing systems","Path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface cleaning","mobile robots","path planning","home automation","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cleaning algorithm","autonomous mobile robot","unknown environment","flexible manufacturing systems","FMS","home services","domestic robots","path planning","optimal path","computer simulation"]}],"abstract":"So far, industrial robots have made significant contributions in manufacturing process and provided versatility to the flexible manufacturing systems (FMS).

The front-view face in the input image is normalized in terms of the size and the location, followed by measurement of the local temperature difference between the averaged neutral and the unknown expression faces. For measuring the local temperature difference, several blocks on the face are selected, based on the studies in the fields of psychology, especially FACS-AU, and computer vision with visible ray, while the blocks including cheekbone region are selected experimentally for improving recognition accuracy. The local temperature difference caused by the rearrangement of face muscle and the inner temperature change is used as input data for a neural network.

These expressions show that the interference rejection levels depend only on the distributions of the source signals and the sample size. This is completed by some numerical simulations showing the important choice of the non-linear functions.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.1997.647070","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

Each column of U is a given standard pattern vector, and there are M standard patterns to be classified. It is also analytically proved that sorting out all nonsingular submatrices U/sup k/ in U can be used as an automatic feature extraction process in this noniterative-learning system. This paper reports the theory, the design, and the experiments of a superfast-learning, optimally-robust, neural network pattern recognition system derived from this novel noniterative learning theory. An unedited video movie showing the speed of learning and the robustness in recognition of this novel pattern recognition system is demonstrated.

A new method utilizing the temporal correlation of motion vectors (MV) has also been developed and simulated. The new method is promising, and its performance is better than nondependent algorithms by subjective assessment.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.1997.647108","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

A wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel model and the coherent BPSK modulation with asynchronous direct-sequence (DS) spreading signal are assumed in the analysis. The average error probabilities for both the forward link and reverse link of the cellular CDMA system over frequency-selective fading channels are derived. The impact of imperfect power control on the performance of the cellular CDMA system is also investigated. The analytical results show that the performance of the cellular CDMA system degrades with an increase in the number of simultaneous users and the number of interfering cells. The performance degradation due to imperfect power control will increase with the variation range of the unfaded received amplitude for each user.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.1997.647160","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

Such a system can be orchestrated to perform an application whose subtasks have diverse execution requirements. Subtasks are assigned to and executed on the machines that will result in a minimal overall execution time for the task, considering factors including inter-machine communication overhead. A conceptual model of the automatic decomposition of tasks and assignment of subtasks is presented. Examples of static and dynamic approaches to the matching and scheduling of subtasks are summarized. Some open research problems are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/EMPDP.1998.647172","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Sixth Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing - PDP '98 -","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Sixth Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing - PDP '98 -","pdfPath":"/iel3/5222/14118/00647172.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMPDP.1998.647172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance mixed-machine heterogeneous computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"High-performance mixed-machine heterogeneous computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5836345","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-23 Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance mixed-machine heterogeneous computing","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"00647172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051993S","chronDate":"21-23 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222","citationCount":"5","articleId":"647172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":647269,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

The key-issue in some specific applications such as electronic shopping on the World Wide Web (WWW) is not just to improve the syllable or word recognition accuracy but to achieve correct understanding of the speech. Thus, key-phrase understanding, which integrates real world knowledge with key-phrase recognition techniques and then achieves partial speech understanding, plays an important role in such areas. A general framework for such a key-phrase understanding problem is presented and an initial application to be used in voice memo systems for Mandarin Chinese has been developed.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON '97 Brisbane - Australia.

The most common VQ algorithms are the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm and the K-means algorithm, proposed by Linde et al. in 1980, which have the advantages of being simple in concept and implementation with low computational costs. However the quantization error of VQ using these algorithm degrades the performance of speech recognizer. We propose an alternative VQ method for Korean speech using a continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM). The CHMM classifies the signal space into clusters of which each cluster is represented by a Gaussian function in the state of HMM. The results show that VQ using a CHMM classifies Korean speech space more effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON '97 Brisbane - Australia. Proceedings of IEEE TENCON '97.

The neural network learns the correlation between blocks to reduce the blocking effect by adjusting the DCT coefficients in the transform domain. In this proposed method, the neural network has an effect on all coefficients of the dequantized block, though it uses the selected three coefficients (one DC coefficient and two low frequency AC) during the training process.

We present an object-based video representation that facilitates both compression and retrieval. Typically in retrieval applications, a video sequence is subdivided in time into a set of shorter segments each of which contains similar content. These segments are represented by 2-D representative images called \"key-frames\" that greatly reduce amount of data that is searched. However, key-frames do not describe the motions and actions of objects within the segment. We propose a representation that extends the ideas of the key-frame to further include what we define as \"key-objects\". These key-objects consist of regions within a key-frame that move with similar motion. Thus our key-objects allow a retrieval system to more efficiently present information to users and assist them in browsing and retrieving relevant video content.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647372.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647372","startPage":"13","endPage":"16 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-based video retrieval and compression: a unified solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647372/","displayDocTitle":"Content-based video retrieval and compression: a unified solution","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5882826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-based video retrieval and compression: a unified solution","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106461S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"47","articleId":"647372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":647374,"authors":[{"name":"Di Zhong","affiliation":["Image and Advanced Television Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Di Zhong","id":"37359857000"},{"name":"Shih-Fu Chang","affiliation":["Image and Advanced Television Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Shih-Fu Chang","id":"37281064000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8183-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"647374","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647374","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Indexing","Colored noise","Video compression","Object segmentation","Optical filters","Video sequences","Image motion analysis","Color","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","image representation","image segmentation","image sequences","feature extraction","motion estimation","visual databases","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object based video representation","spatio-temporal video search","video editing","feature regions","content-based video search","video object segmentation","video object tracking","feature fusion","region grouping","spatio-temporal video query","motion estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647374","endPage":"24 vol.1","startPage":"21","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal video search using the object based video representation","abstract":"Object-based video representation provides great promises for new search and editing functionalities.

However, minimizing MSE does not guarantee preservation of good perceptual qualities in the decoded image, especially at low bit rates. In this paper we propose a perceptually-tuned embedded zerotree image codec (PEZ) that introduces a perceptual weighting to the wavelet transform coefficients prior to EZW encoding. In this coder the EZW minimizes a perceptually based distortion measure instead of MSE. The perceptual weights for all subbands are computed based on the just noticeable distortion (JND) thresholds for uniform noise. The new perceptually tuned codec has the same complexity as the original EZW/SPIHT techniques and results in a comparable or superior coding performance. Coding results are presented to illustrate the performance of the new coder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Distortion measurement","Codecs","Humans","Visual system","Discrete wavelet transforms","Telecommunications","Bit rate","Signal analysis","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","least mean squares methods","computational complexity","decoding","wavelet transforms","transform coding","trees (mathematics)","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptually tuned embedded zerotree image coder","embedded zerotree wavelet coding","set partitioning in hierarchical trees","SPIHT","mean-square error distortion measure","decoded image","perceptually-tuned embedded zerotree image codec","PEZ","wavelet transform coefficients","EZW encoding","noise","complexity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647379","startPage":"41","endPage":"44 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647379.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A perceptually tuned embedded zerotree image coder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A perceptually tuned embedded zerotree image coder","accessionNumber":"5882833","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A perceptually tuned embedded zerotree image coder","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037052S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"14","articleId":"647379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":647390,"authors":[{"name":"Xuguang Yang","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Xuguang Yang","id":"37613279400"},{"name":"K.

The basic motivation for our coder is that motion fields are typically smooth and therefore can be efficiently captured through a multiresolutional framework. A wavelet decomposition is applied on each video frame and the coefficients at each level are predicted from the coarser level through backward motion compensation. To remove the aliasing effects caused by downsampling in the transform, a special interpolation filter is designed with the weighted aliasing energy as part of the optimization goal, and motion estimation is carried out with lowpass filtering and interpolation in the estimation loop. A novel adaptive quantization scheme is then applied to code the motion predicted residue wavelet coefficients in each band. Experimental results reveal typically a 0.5-2 dB increase on coded PSNR at 24-48 kb/s over the state-of-the-art H.263 standard, with also a considerable improvement in subjective reconstruction quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical backward motion compensation for wavelet video coding using optimized interpolation filters","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647390","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647390.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical backward motion compensation for wavelet video coding using optimized interpolation filters","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5882844","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical backward motion compensation for wavelet video coding using optimized interpolation filters","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026829S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"3","articleId":"647390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":647391,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Performance evaluation tests show that the new method is capable of achieving higher compression rates with the addition of a very small overhead due to global motion estimation.

Due to the imperfect nature of such systems, the binary image is unavoidably corrupted by blur and noise to form a grey-scale image. We present a technique to reverse this degradation which maps the binary object reconstruction problem into a Viterbi state-trellis. We assign states of the trellis to possible outcomes of the reconstruction estimate and search the trellis in the usual optimal fashion. Our method yields superior estimates of the original binary object over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) when compared with conventional Wiener filter (WF) estimates. For moderate blur and SNR levels, the estimates produced approach the maximum likelihood (ML) bound on estimation performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Viterbi algorithm","Image storage","Yield estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Facsimile","Degradation","State estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Wiener filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","search problems","optimisation","maximum likelihood estimation","white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary image reconstruction","2D Viterbi search","binary objects imaging","archival storage","text documents","microfilm","facsimile transmission","text transmission","blur","AWGN","grey-scale image","binary object reconstruction","Viterbi state-trellis","reconstruction estimate","optimal search method","signal-to-noise ratios","SNR","Wiener filter estimates","maximum likelihood bound","estimation performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647440","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647440","startPage":"181","endPage":"184 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647440.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647440/","displayDocTitle":"Binary image reconstruction via 2-D Viterbi search","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5888856","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary image reconstruction via 2-D Viterbi search","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041899S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"16","articleId":"647440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":647458,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This strategy is proposed to overcome weak discrimination and to consider dynamic properties of EMG signals. Two discrimination strategies (HMM, and HMM with three subnet MLPs) for discriminating signals representative of 6 primitive class of motions are described and compared. The proposed strategy increase the discrimination results considerably.

Because of the growing numbers of open-loop drives operating in the low speed region, the synthesis of accurate output voltages has become an important issue where low cost implementation plays an important role. The so-called average dead time compensation techniques rely on two basic parameters to compensate for this effect: the magnitude of the volt-seconds lost each PWM cycle; and the direction of the current. In a low cost implementation, it is impractical to attempt an online measurement of the volt-seconds error introduced each cycle; instead an offline measurement is favored. On the other hand, the current-direction detection must be done online. This becomes increasingly difficult at lower frequencies and around the zero crossings leading to erroneous compensation and voltage distortion. This paper presents a simple and cost effective solution to this problem by using an instantaneous back calculation of the phase angle of the current. Given the closed loop characteristic of the back calculation, the zero crossing of the current is accurately obtained, thus allowing for a better dead time compensation. Experimental results validating the proposed method are presented.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1998.647675","publicationTitle":"APEC '98 Thirteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC '98 Thirteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5223/14120/00647675.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"100 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1998.647675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line dead time compensation technique for open-loop PWM-VSI drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-line dead time compensation technique for open-loop PWM-VSI drives","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5870884","publicationDate":"1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","conferenceDate":"15-19 Feb. 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line dead time compensation technique for open-loop PWM-VSI drives","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049471S","chronDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223","citationCount":"21","articleId":"647675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":647685,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The control method implementation, transient response and output inductor design equations, and equations for designing an input filter to reduce input current di/dt are provided.

The operating principle is based on the connection of a voltage source and a loss-free resistor (LFR) between the input rectifier and the bulk capacitor in a conventional switching-mode power supply with no power factor correction. Both the voltage source and the LFR are obtained as an additional output from the power converter's transformer. This additional output is a forward-type scheme with one extra inductor. With the final topology, a good tradeoff between capacitor voltage, re-cycling energy and harmonic content can be established in order to comply with IEC 1000-3-2 at different power levels.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1998.647730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1998.647730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14120","startPage":"461","endPage":"467 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC '98 Thirteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5223/14120/00647730.pdf","publicationTitle":"APEC '98 Thirteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647730","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Capacitors","Resistors","Rectifiers","Power supplies","Power factor correction","Inductors","Topology","Power system harmonics","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC/DC power conversion","input current shaper","operating principle","voltage source","loss-free resistor","input rectifier","bulk capacitor","switching-mode power supply","power converter transformer","forward-type topology","inductor","harmonic content","energy re-cycling","IEC 1000-3-2"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Input current shaper based on the series connection of a voltage source and a loss-free resistor","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"15-19 Feb. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5863908","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647730/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input current shaper based on the series connection of a voltage source and a loss-free resistor","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647730.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027965S","chronDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223","citationCount":"65","articleId":"647730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":647735,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper presents the relationship between IGBT wire-bond package layout and its equivalent circuit parasitic inductance. It is shown that the dominant parasitic inductance inside the package mainly comes from the terminal leads. The parasitic inductance contributed by the wire-bonds is not a significant value. But the parasitic effects related to the closed coupling between the bonding wires causes several problems. They cause nonuniform current distribution between bonding wires, unbalanced transient current between paralleled IGBT chips in high power IGBT modules, as well as the mechanical stress on the connection joints induced by the magnetic fields. This phenomenon explains one of the wire-bonds' fatigue and failure mechanisms caused by the packaging parasitics. The analysis of packaging layout shows the possible options to reduce the parasitic inductance, alleviate the parasitic effects, and improve the module reliability.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1998.647735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1998.647735","startPage":"497","endPage":"503 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC '98 Thirteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel4/5223/14120/00647735.pdf","publicationTitle":"APEC '98 Thirteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of parasitics within wire-bond IGBT modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of parasitics within wire-bond IGBT modules","conferenceDate":"15-19 Feb. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5863913","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647735/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of parasitics within wire-bond IGBT modules","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027345S","chronDate":"15-19 Feb 1998","isNumber":"14120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223","citationCount":"86","articleId":"647735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":647748,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Shien Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Shien Lu","id":"37068964300"},{"name":"Wen-Liang Hwang","lastName":"Wen-Liang Hwang","id":"37086997769"},{"name":"Pau-Choo Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pau-Choo Chung","id":"37287692900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8183-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"647748","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"A common assumption of the shape from texture problem is that a perceived image mainly contains only one type of texture with the same surface orientation. Unfortunately, a natural image is often composed of more than one textures. In order to solve the shape from texture problem in a practical manner, we need to segment 3D textured images. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the task. We estimate the local surface orientations from the the scales of the ridge points of continuous wavelet transform. Then, the local surface orientations are used as the features for texture segmentation. Textured images synthesized from Brodatz's album and several natural images demonstrate the performance of our method.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647748.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"238 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of 3D textured images using continuous wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Continuous wavelet transforms","Image segmentation","Wavelet transforms","Surface fitting","Shape","Surface waves","Surface texture","Layout","Frequency estimation","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image texture","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D textured image segmentation","continuous wavelet transform","image texture","surface orientation","image shape","shape from texture problem","algorithm","local surface orientations","scales","ridge points","texture segmentation","Brodatz's album","natural images","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of 3D textured images using continuous wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5888870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of 3D textured images using continuous wavelet transform","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041168S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"1","articleId":"647748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":647763,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In short (about 300 points) data sequences CE is evaluated with a correction which considers as random the patterns that appear only one time and would otherwise be considered as regular. The minimum of the corrected CE (CCE) with increasing pattern length is chosen as the most reliable CE estimate. Beat-to-beat heart period series were analysed in 8 normal subjects at rest (R), head up tilt (T) and controlled respiration (CR). A significant decrease in CCE was found in T (0.9/spl plusmn/0.052) compared to R (1.01/spl plusmn/0.037); during CR, CCE displayed a slight and not significant increase (1.07/spl plusmn/0.055). The enhanced LF activity present in T seems to have a greater regularising power than the periodical input provided by CR at HF.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1997.647845","displayPublicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/5227/14126/00647845.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1997.647845","publicationTitle":"Computers in Cardiology 1997","startPage":"121","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronisation analysis of heart period variability signal based on corrected conditional entropy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Synchronisation analysis of heart period variability signal based on corrected conditional entropy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647845/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5842603","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronisation analysis of heart period variability signal based on corrected conditional entropy","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00647845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063935S","chronDate":"7-10 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227","citationCount":"2","articleId":"647845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":647849,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Interpolation has been done with linear or cubic spline methods. In this work, we propose an alternative, that is a combination of the adaptive weights preconditioning method and the method of conjugate gradient for the solution of positive definite linear systems.

The input to VF15 is a training set of records. Each record contains clinical measurements, from ECG signals and some other information such as sex, age, and weight, along with the decision of an expert cardiologist. The knowledge representation is based on a recent technique called Feature Intervals, where a concept is represented by the projections of the training cases on each feature separately. Classification in VF15 is based on a majority voting among the class predictions made by each feature separately. The comparison of the VF15 algorithm indicates that it outperforms other standard algorithms such as Naive Bayesian and Nearest Neighbor classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647926/","accessionNumber":"5842637","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A supervised machine learning algorithm for arrhythmia analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A supervised machine learning algorithm for arrhythmia analysis","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"00647926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04414S","chronDate":"7-10 Sep 1997","isNumber":"14126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5227","citationCount":"58","articleId":"647926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":647937,"authors":[{"name":"P. de Chazal","affiliation":["Biomedical Systems Laboratory, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"P.","lastName":"de Chazal","id":"37283324500"},{"name":"B.

First the Cartesian x and y shape coordinate functions are transformed to the domain of polar coordinates yielding an r and a /spl phi/ function. Then these functions are transformed using a DCT. Using Cartesian coordinates means describing the shape in terms of straight lines and blocks, while for using polar coordinates this is in terms of circles and curves. Because of this more natural representation, compression can be more efficient and degradation due to errors or low bit rates will be more graceful. Using a spectral decomposition enables bit-rate and distortion control, error-resilience and layered coding while degrading the shape as a whole without specific local artifacts or errors. Bit allocation is possible using standard techniques and the computational load is low. A first implementation shows promising results around 1 to 2 bits per shape point, allowing an error of 2 to 1 pixels respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647963","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647963.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"519 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape coding using polar coordinates and the discrete cosine transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647963/","displayDocTitle":"Shape coding using polar coordinates and the discrete cosine transform","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5888941","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape coding using polar coordinates and the discrete cosine transform","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047783S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"6","articleId":"647963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":647964,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper a new watermarking technique to add a code to digital images is presented; the method operates in the frequency domain embedding a pseudo-random sequence of real numbers in a selected set of DCT coefficients. Watermark casting is performed by exploiting the masking characteristics of the human visual system, to ensure watermark invisibility. The embedded sequence is extracted without resorting to the original image, so that the proposed technique represents a major improvement to methods relying on the comparison between the watermarked and original images. Experimental results demonstrate that the watermark is robust to most of the signal processing techniques and geometric distortions.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647964","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647964.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","startPage":"520","endPage":"523 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCT-based watermark recovering without resorting to the uncorrupted original image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DCT-based watermark recovering without resorting to the uncorrupted original image","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647964/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5888942","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCT-based watermark recovering without resorting to the uncorrupted original image","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035444S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"193","articleId":"647964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":647966,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This key is typically not public, because publication of the key would give rise to attacks on the watermark. In practical systems, however, watermarking techniques are required that enable public decoding of the watermark. In this paper, an extension of spread-spectrum watermarking is presented which enables public decoding and verification of the watermark, without at the same time giving the possibility of removing the watermark. The underlying idea, is to make only parts of the pseudo-noise key public. The scheme can be combined with a fast compressed-domain embedding technique to facilitate on-the-fly compressed-domain public-key watermarking.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast public-key watermarking of compressed video","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647966","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647966.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"531 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast public-key watermarking of compressed video","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5888944","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast public-key watermarking of compressed video","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025208S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"61","articleId":"647966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":647967,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Our algorithm yields a fully embedded, low-complexity coder with PSNRs from 0.7 to 1.7 dB better than baseline JPEG for standard test images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.647984","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00647984.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"603 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.647984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Significance tree quantization of the discrete cosine transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=647984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/647984/","displayDocTitle":"Significance tree quantization of the discrete cosine transform","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5888962","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Significance tree quantization of the discrete cosine transform","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00647984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036974S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"2","articleId":"647984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":647986,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

A linear magnitude predictor coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, provides a reasonable description of the conditional probability densities.

We show that the positions can be evaluated in O(n/sup 2/) or even O(n log n) flops by solving a set of n linear equations and computing an FFT. The determination of n is part of the algorithm, whose stability is also discussed. The values of the n incorrect pixels can then be estimated using any of the interpolation methods known.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00648007.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"694 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.648007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.648007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locating and correcting errors in images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Pixel","Discrete Fourier transforms","Interpolation","Fourier transforms","Nonlinear equations","Stability","Telecommunications","Extrapolation","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extrapolation","interpolation","numerical stability","image coding","error correction codes","coding errors","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image error correction","image error location","image interpolation algorithm","image extrapolation algorithm","pixels","incorrect pixels location","Fourier transform","nonlinear problem","linear equations","FFT","algorithm stability","error control codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Locating and correcting errors in images","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5888985","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locating and correcting errors in images","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03642S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"17","articleId":"648007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":648034,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Unavoidable tradeoffs between hardware and software implementations of these functions have created unfavorable attributes for designs. Branching and jumps in software allow only the immediately needed function to take up processing resources, but software cannot match the speed of performing the function in dedicated hardware. Hardware, however, is rigid, and permanently embodying functions in it adds to the overhead (size, weight and power) of the system. Simplifying the hardware to reduce this overhead only restricts how the modules can be configured during operation. Our architecture uses a dynamically reconfigurable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to bring together the benefits of hardware and software while mitigating the costs of both. The resultant design supports fault tolerance and multiprocessing among computing modules flexibly and judiciously while accelerating the application throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 High-Assurance Engineering Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel3/5231/14136/00648034.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 High-Assurance Engineering Workshop","doi":"10.1109/HASE.1997.648034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.1997.648034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14136","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing system dependability with dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Fault tolerance","Software performance","Field programmable gate arrays","Concurrent computing","Parallel processing","Computer architecture","Costs","Acceleration","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system dependability enhancement","dynamically reconfigurable FPGA","computing module configuration","fault-tolerant computing","parallel computing","logical functions","hardware implementations","software implementations","design attributes","program branching","program jumps","processing resources","execution speed","system overhead","field-programmable gate array","cost mitigation","multiprocessing","application throughput acceleration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing system dependability with dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5863927","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-12 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing system dependability with dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00648034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030301S","chronDate":"11-12 Aug 1997","isNumber":"14136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231","articleId":"648034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":648064,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first model, denoted the Logical Application Stream Model (LASM), recursively captures a distributed application's structure, resource requirements, and relevant end to end quality of service (QoS) parameters. Upon invocation of the application by a user, the resource manager can use this model to initially structure the end to end application, allocate resources to this application, and schedule this application on these resources, so as to provide QoS to all applications and to efficiently utilize system resources. Later, when the system state changes, the resource manager can use this application model to dynamically reallocate, reschedule, and restructure applications. The recursive nature of the model enables application developers to easily model large scale applications. We also describe a model, denoted the Benefit Function (BF), that captures user QoS preferences and enables the resource manager to gracefully degrade application QoS under certain conditions.","doi":"10.1109/HASE.1997.648064","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 High-Assurance Engineering Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 High-Assurance Engineering Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel3/5231/14136/00648064.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.1997.648064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling applications for adaptive QoS-based resource management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Modeling applications for adaptive QoS-based resource management","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5856553","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-12 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling applications for adaptive QoS-based resource management","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00648064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053368S","chronDate":"11-12 Aug 1997","isNumber":"14136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5231","citationCount":"38","articleId":"648064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":648065,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Chul Han","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Center for Image Processing Research, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Soo-Chul Han","id":"37615017900"},{"name":"J.W.

This paper introduces the technique of motion-compensated vertical filters within pairs of fields to solve the problem of sampling rate conversion between interlaced and progressive raster. It is shown that the motion-compensated vertical filter is a polyphase realization of a factor-2 up- or downsampling filterbank, with polyphase shift controlled by motion parameters. Possible applications are down- and up-conversion between progressive and interlaced formats, and multiresolution representation of video data within a spatio-temporal subband or wavelet framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4998/14092/00648073.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"762 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1997.648073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1997.648073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-raster multiresolution video processing with motion compensation techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Signal resolution","Sampling methods","Motion estimation","Image resolution","Image processing","Filter bank","Motion control","Scalability","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","image resolution","image sampling","band-pass filters","motion compensation","image reconstruction","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-raster multiresolution video processing","motion compensation","standard format","video acquisition","video transmission","video presentation","interlaced scanning","digital video services","progressive format","signal resolution","temporal sampling effects","vertical sampling effects","motion-compensated vertical filters","sampling rate conversion","progressive raster","interlaced raster","polyphase filter","factor-2 upsampling filterbank","factor-2 downsampling filterbank","polyphase shift","motion parameters","multiresolution representation","video data","spatio-temporal subband framework","wavelet framework","perfect reconstruction filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Variable-raster multiresolution video processing with motion compensation techniques","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5889002","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-raster multiresolution video processing with motion compensation techniques","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049887S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"8","articleId":"648073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":648074,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We present a novel frequency synthesis algorithm which constructs a set of 8/spl times/8 DCT coefficients from four original 8/spl times/8 DCT blocks.

In applications such as video browsing or picture-in-picture or transcoding for a lower bit rate, there is a need to downscale the video before transmission. In such instances, the conventional approach of generating a downscaled video bitstream at the video server is to first decompress the video, perform the downscaling operation in the pixel domain and then recompress it for efficient delivery. This process is computationally expensive due to the motion-estimation process needed during the recompression phase. We propose an alternative compressed domain based approach that computes the motion vectors for the downscaled (N/2/spl times/N/2) video sequence directly from the original motion vectors residing in the N/spl times/N video sequence. Furthermore, the downscaling of the DCT information is also done in the DCT domain. The proposed approach can lead to significant computational savings compared to the conventional spatial domain approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648076/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5889005","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive motion vector resampling for compressed video down-scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive motion vector resampling for compressed video down-scaling","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036583S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct 1997","isNumber":"14092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4998","citationCount":"21","articleId":"648076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":648095,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

A method for coastline detection based on a sequence of basic-processing procedures followed by a contour tracing algorithm is also introduced in order to obtain sea-land separation to enhance the internal wave detection problem. The utility of wavelet analysis as a tool for automatic oceanic internal wave detection and orientation from SAR images is examined using the 2-D wavelet transform based on the local modulus maxima.

Several decision circuits for an optical communication receiver system, are designed and simulated using AIM-SPICE circuit simulation tools, based on extracted process parameter using an in-house characterization and modeling tool named CMLEE.

All the waveform simulations showed good performance at 10 Gbps. It is observed that the 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS circuits of current mainstream electronic systems shows more than a 10 GHz operation, opening an opportunity for high frequency as long as deep sub-/spl mu/m technology compromises maturity and cost in reality. In terms of power consumption, the sub-half 0.5 /spl mu/m GaAs MESFET at 4.2 mW is the best choice for the same 10 GHz speed performance, compared to 60 mW by the 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS circuit.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1997.648243","publicationTitle":"TENCON '97 Brisbane - Australia.

Generating an influence diagram is known to require much time and effort, and the resulting model can be generally applicable to only a specific decision problem. In order to reduce the burden of modeling decision problems, the concept of DCA is introduced. DCA under consideration is viewed as a classification problem where a set of input-output data pairs is given. We thus propose a method utilizing a feedforward neural network with a supervised learning rule to develop DCA based on an influence diagram.

While the discrete engineering characteristics of a battery, such as the physical dimensions of the individual components, are relatively straightforward to define explicitly, their myriad chemical and physical processes, including interactions, are much more difficult to accurately represent. For this reason, development of analytical models that can consistently predict the performance of a battery has only been partially successful, even though significant resources have been applied to this problem. As an alternative approach, we have begun development of non-phenomenological models for battery systems based on artificial neural networks. The paper describes initial feasibility studies as well as current models and makes comparisons between predicted and actual performance.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1998.648303","startPage":"115","endPage":"121 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel4/5217/14117/00648303.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1998.648303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network simulation of battery performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Batteries","Chemical processes","Electrodes","Power system modeling","Surface morphology","Predictive models","Testing","Kinetic theory","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cells (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network simulation","battery performance","chemical processes","discrete engineering characteristics","physical processes","non phenomenological models","battery systems","feasibility studies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan 1998","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network simulation of battery performance","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-9 Jan. 1998","accessionNumber":"5856078","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network simulation of battery performance","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00648303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053674S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5217","citationCount":"14","articleId":"648303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":648304,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

The scheme is unique in that half-pixel resolution ME and MC are applied on filtered coefficients ahead of decimation to preserve motion consistency and yet achieve minimal prediction residue. An efficient motion-compensated WT video coding system is built based on the proposed ME and MC. In the coding scheme, according to the property of embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) coding, the mean square error (MSE) criterion is used in ME instead of normally adopted sum of absolute difference, and an overlapped MC algorithm is developed to combat the block effect introduced by block-based ME and improve peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance. The superior performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated with experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1997.648526","publicationTitle":"TENCON '97 Brisbane - Australia.

While it is shown that joint torque negative feedback has a good effect on vibration suppression, the property of disturbance rejection is easily deteriorated when a high-gain joint torque feedback is used. Based on the assignment of pole-distribution, the relationships between vibration suppression and disturbance rejection are analyzed.

A numerical example, using a simple concatenated coding scheme, provides a vehicle for explaining how error performance can be improved when soft outputs from the decoders are used in an iterative decoding process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Concatenated codes","Detectors","Voltage","Vehicles","Probes","Reed-Solomon codes","Convolutional codes","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","convolutional codes","Viterbi decoding","iterative methods","error statistics","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance","turbo codes","bit-error-probability","Shannon limit","benefits","concatenated codes","likelihood functions","a posteriori probabilities","decoders","error performance","soft outputs","iterative decoding process"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648658","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14137/00648658.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"26 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo code concepts made easy, or how I learned to concatenate and reiterate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Turbo code concepts made easy, or how I learned to concatenate and reiterate","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648658/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5945411","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo code concepts made easy, or how I learned to concatenate and reiterate","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044345S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"1","articleId":"648658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":648660,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Binary block BCH codes of medium length have been chosen to construct powerful MLC 8PSK schemes and an efficient soft decision decoding algorithm has been used in the MSD decoder. Error rate performances have been evaluated by simulations and compared favourably to the cutoff rate limit over Rayleigh channels. The new MSD decoding scheme presents several advantages compared to the usual method based on the Viterbi algorithm. The most interesting one is that the decoding complexity is not dependent of the trellis structure of the block codes, it can thus cope with the codes of medium length that are used to construct very powerful MLC 8PSK codes. Very few computations are necessary when the channel is under good conditions. When the channel is worse, the computation effort can be pre-limited, without important loss of performance. It has however a more complex structure and a variable processing delay. Simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the constructed MLC schemes, For the interesting bandwidth efficiencies ranged from 1.5 to 2.6 bits/s/Hz, very good error rate performances have been obtained. Comparison with the known codes and the cutoff rate limit revealed that these new MLC 8PSK codes are very powerful for information transmission over Rayleigh fading channels. The adopted soft decision decoding algorithm can be adapted to different levels of performance/complexity degree, so good performance/complexity trade-offs can be achieved for these MLC/MSD schemes for practical applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft decoding of BCH codes applied to multilevel modulation codes for Rayleigh fading channels","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648660","startPage":"32","endPage":"36 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14137","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14137/00648660.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Soft decoding of BCH codes applied to multilevel modulation codes for Rayleigh fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5945413","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft decoding of BCH codes applied to multilevel modulation codes for Rayleigh fading channels","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648660.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035401S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","isNumber":"14137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"1","articleId":"648660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":648683,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

A new breed of design automation tools is helping them scrimp on power at every step of the VLSI design process. The automation tools can be differentiated, to a first order, by the level of abstraction on which they operate. Lowest of all are the transistor level tools. These possess the best accuracy, but commensurately require the longest run times and have the smallest capacities-the size of the circuit that can be analyzed. While transistor level tools can assist with analyses earlier in the design process, they are typically used to characterize cells and modules for use at the higher abstraction levels. The next level of abstraction embraces the logic-level power analysis tools. The highest abstraction level for which power analysis tools exist today is the architectural level. This type of tool analyzes abstract design representations such as Verilog or VHDL RTL code. The use of these tools in power reduction design is outlined.","doi":"10.1109/6.648684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel4/6/14133/00648684.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.648684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The practical engineer [A multi-level approach to low-power IC design]","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648684/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","displayDocTitle":"The practical engineer [A multi-level approach to low-power IC design]","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5852501","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The practical engineer [A multi-level approach to low-power IC design]","sourcePdf":"0298-054-60P_ASIC.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048866S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"14","articleId":"648684","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":648715,"authors":[{"name":"Suk Chan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suk Chan Kim","id":"37366919500"},{"name":"Taejoo Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Taejoo Chang","id":"37350321300"},{"name":"Seong Ill Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong Ill Park","id":"38255785500"},{"name":"Iickho Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Iickho Song","id":"37289097300"},{"name":"Min Sou Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Daejeon, KR"],"lastName":"Min Sou Lee","id":"37615694500"},{"name":"Hyung-Myung Kim","lastName":"Hyung-Myung Kim","id":"37086996742"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4249-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"648715","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Scattering","Explosives","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna arrays","Computer simulation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","direction-of-arrival estimation","array signal processing","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","adaptive antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector channel modeling","adaptive beamforming","multipath propagation","base-station antenna arrays","multi-user interference","wireless communication","interference reduction","locally scattered signals","beamformer weights","computer simulation","performance","urban environment","angular spread","scattering effects"]}],"abstract":"There has been an explosive increase in the number of mobile users which causes the multi-user interference problem. In addition, the realization of wireless communication inevitably requires high speed and quality information exchange. Antenna arrays at base-stations can be used to transmit and receive the information spatially selectively by reducing the interference effects. A new model of locally scattered signals in the vicinity of mobiles is proposed, and under this model the weights of the beamformer are obtained. Computer simulation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is excellent in performance and works well even in the urban environment where there is multipath propagation with a wide angular spread. The sensitivity of the direction and scattering effects are also obtained by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648715","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14137/00648715.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648715","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","startPage":"266","endPage":"270 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector channel modeling and adaptive beamforming for multipath propagation using base-station antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"A vector channel modeling and adaptive beamforming for multipath propagation using base-station antenna arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648715/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5945457","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector channel modeling and adaptive beamforming for multipath propagation using base-station antenna arrays","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038602S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","articleId":"648715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":648721,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The performance measure is the mean acquisition time, T/sub MA/. The equations for the mean acquisition times when the integration time of the verification mode and the number of uncertainty cells are parameters are derived in two cases, i.e., when the first stage decision is based on threshold comparison at the matched filter output or on selecting the maximum at the matched filter output. Different threshold setting rules, i.e., fixed thresholds, constant false alarm rate (CFAR) criteria and the optimum threshold in the sense of minimising the mean acquisition time are compared to the case when no threshold is used (maximum selection). The comparisons are made in an AWGN channel as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio E/sub b//N/sub 0/. The comparisons are mainly performed using coherent acquisition but also a consideration for the practical noncoherent case is given. The results indicate that the best performance is obtained by using the CFAR-criteria when the probability of false alarm is selected properly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5945463","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of two dwell code acquisition of DS signal using different threshold setting rules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of two dwell code acquisition of DS signal using different threshold setting rules","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044818S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"3","articleId":"648721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":648741,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The basic function of this payload is to simultaneously relay full-duplex communication links to and from ground-based HCTRs. The maximum data rate that will be supported across these full-duplex links is 45 Mbps over a range up to 100 miles. Multiple full-duplex communication links can be supported by this UAV payload at the penalty of reduced communication range and/or reduced data rate throughput for each link. In addition to this full-duplex communications capability, a broadcast communication adjunct (at data rates up to Tl) will also be provided.

Currently under development are several low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems that propose to deliver voice and data traffic to subscribers anywhere on the globe. However, very little is known about the performance of conventional routing protocols under orbital conditions where the topology changes in minutes rather than days. This paper compares two routing protocols in a LEO environment. One (extended Bellman-Ford) is a conventional terrestrial routing protocol, while the other (Darting) is a new protocol which has been proposed as suitable for use in LEO networks. These protocols are compared via computer simulation in two of the proposed LEO systems (Globalstar and Iridium), under various traffic intensities. Comparative measures of packet delay, convergence speed, and protocol overhead are made. It is found that while both protocols have roughly equivalent end-to-end delay characteristics, Darting requires a much higher overhead. Darting also demonstrates higher instability at network update periods. Darting is handicapped by a strong correlation between data traffic and protocol overhead. Modifications to reduce this overhead would result in better performance.","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14137/00648747.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"433 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of two routing protocols operating in a low Earth orbit satellite network environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of two routing protocols operating in a low Earth orbit satellite network environment","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5945488","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of two routing protocols operating in a low Earth orbit satellite network environment","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033014S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","citationCount":"12","articleId":"648747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":648754,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

These systems aim to support a wide range of services from voice and low-rate data up to high-rate data services, including multimedia services, and circuit- and packet-oriented services. These systems will operate in all radio environments to provide service to anyone, anytime, anywhere. In Europe the European Commission is partly funding research activities in the ACTS framework related to third-generation systems. A spectrum-efficient multiple access scheme proposal is being developed by the ACTS FRAMES project to fulfill the requirements for terrestrial third-generation mobile radio systems. The results and proposals of FRAMES are used as input mainly to the ETSI standardization process. This radio access scheme addresses the different worldwide standardization activities where TDMA and CDMA-based solutions are currently expected. Different proposals for the UMTS system architecture and network issues are currently being discussed in the relevant standardization bodies. On one hand, the GRAN approach envisages a single UMTS access part able to connect with multiple core networks; on the other hand, the generic core network approach proposes to develop UMTS core network functionality able to handle multiple access networks, which can adopt different types of radio access techniques. The ACTS RAINBOW project presents a proposal where both approaches are unified in a system structure. From the network planning viewpoint, the major features of a third-generation mobile system are the wide variety of services provided, the high number of customers expected (especially in urban and densely populated areas), the network architecture flexibility to allow different configurations to be deployed, and the advanced mobility management strategies. From this perspective the ACTS STORMS project is elaborating new planning methodologies tailored to the specific needs of a UMTS operator, and designing and developing a set of software modules covering the whole set of disciplines involved in mobile network planning.","doi":"10.1109/35.648769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/35/14141/00648769.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.648769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14141","startPage":"82","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research activities on UMTS radio interface, network architectures, and planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research activities on UMTS radio interface, network architectures, and planning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"5859509","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research activities on UMTS radio interface, network architectures, and planning","sourcePdf":"00648769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064259S","chronDate":"Feb.  1998","isNumber":"14141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"52","articleId":"648769","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":648770,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Estimation of an accurate amount of bandwidth to support this traffic has been a challenging task using conventional algorithmic approaches. We show that radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) are capable of learning the non-linear multi-dimensional mapping between different video traffic patterns, quality of service (QoS) requirements and the required bandwidth to support each call. In addition, the RBFNN model adopts to new traffic scenarios and still produces accurate results. This approach bypass the modeling approach which requires detailed knowledge about the traffic statistical patterns. Our method employs \"on-line\" measurements of the traffic count process over a monitoring period. In order to simplify the design of the RBFNN, the input traffic is preprocessed through a lowpass filter in order to smooth all high frequency fluctuations. A large set of training data, representing different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, was used to ensure that the RBFNN can generalize and produce accurate results when confronted with new data. The reported results prove that the neurocomputing approach is effective in achieving more accurate results than other traditional methods, based upon mathematical or simulation analysis. This is primarily due to the fact that the unique learning and adaptive capabilities of NN enable them to extract and memorize rules from previous experience.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648770","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00648770.png","startPage":"493","endPage":"497 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel3/5148/14137/00648770.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 97 MILCOM 97 Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1997.648770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial basis functions for bandwidth estimation in ATM networks using RBF neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Quality of service","Bit rate","Radial basis function networks","Monitoring","Data preprocessing","Filters","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication networks","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive systems","visual communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth estimation","ATM networks","RBF neural network","variable bit rate","VBR video traffic","long term correlations","nonstationary behavior","radial basis function neural networks","nonlinear multi-dimensional mapping","video traffic patterns","quality of service","QoS requirements","RBFNN model","on-line measurements","traffic count process","input traffic","lowpass filter","training dat","HF fluctuations smoothing","neurocomputing approach","adaptive capabilities","rules"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Radial basis functions for bandwidth estimation in ATM networks using RBF neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5952695","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial basis functions for bandwidth estimation in ATM networks using RBF neural network","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00648770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042895S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov 1997","isNumber":"14137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5148","articleId":"648770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":648777,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A vector control strategy is considered, for a motor with sinusoidal flux distribution. The sliding mode observer detects the voltages induced by the magnet flux on the stator windings. These signals are used to calculate the rotor position and speed needed for vector control. Due to the sliding mode operation, filters are used to smooth the estimated variables. A speed-dependent compensation is also proposed, in order to achieve an accurate estimation of the rotor position. As the observed variables are not available below a limit frequency, an open loop starting procedure is implemented. The resulting observer has been fully analyzed by simulations, in order to test the performance both in steady-state and transient operations. Experimental results based on a DSP TMS320C50 controller are presented, showing the performance of the sensorless drive over a wide range of operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5856253","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless speed control of a PM synchronous motor by sliding mode observer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless speed control of a PM synchronous motor by sliding mode observer","confLoc":"Guimaraes, Portugal","sourcePdf":"00648894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034719S","chronDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","isNumber":"14135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230","citationCount":"38","articleId":"648894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":648918,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

A special new environment, written in CPP language, has been developed around the PSPICE kernel in order to provide design and simulation facilities.

The learning of inverse dynamics with neural networks is an example of robot control applications. The dynamics of nonlinear systems vary with their parameters, and, in some cases, determining a single global model of the plant dynamics can be a very difficult problem. Designing piecewise control laws are useful methods to overcome this problem. In robotics, increasing the degree of freedom and working range of each link directly creates more complex dynamics. The structure of a multilayer perceptron is dependent on the controlled plant and, for more complex systems, large networks are required and this increases the real time calculations of robot control. For the proposed scheme, in order to decrease the real time calculations, the working range of the robot is divided into several regions and, for every region, a separate neural network is used. Instead of learning whole dynamics with one large network, using this kind of strategy, one divides the complexity of the dynamics to small networks. In real time control, this piecewise or regional neural network structure is used together with a PD controller.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.1997.648920","pdfPath":"/iel4/5230/14135/00648920.pdf","startPage":"1238","endPage":"1241 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"ISIE '97 Proceeding of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"ISIE '97 Proceeding of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.1997.648920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robot control application with neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"A robot control application with neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5856272","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robot control application with neural networks","confLoc":"Guimaraes, Portugal","sourcePdf":"00648920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030872S","chronDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","isNumber":"14135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230","citationCount":"4","articleId":"648920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":648921,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

A specialized neural network structure is employed which is a variation of a two-layer sigma-pi neural network paradigm. By training the network to emulate a given polynomial, the lower-order factor polynomials are generated whose coefficients are represented by the network's weights. While the simple learning rule based on gradient descent sometimes fails to give satisfactory results, a new modified learning rule is proposed which is based on constrained optimization techniques. The proposed method achieves minimization of the usual mean-square error criterion along with a simultaneous satisfaction of constraints between the coefficients of the given polynomial and the coefficients of the desired factor polynomials. Using this approach, suitably augmented by weight elimination techniques, the authors are able to obtain exact solutions for factorable polynomials and excellent approximate solutions for nonfactorable polynomials. Simulations are presented to illustrate the good performance and efficiency of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5856279","displayDocTitle":"Factorization of 2-D polynomials using neural networks and constrained learning techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factorization of 2-D polynomials using neural networks and constrained learning techniques","confLoc":"Guimaraes, Portugal","sourcePdf":"00648928.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07251S","chronDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","isNumber":"14135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230","citationCount":"5","articleId":"648928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":648948,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Nevertheless, switch-mode operation results in electromagnetic interference (EMI) which is produced due to large di/dt and dv/dt. One way to reduce the EMI is the use of classic and expensive input filters or include the active filter into the power circuits. By using randomized pulse width modulation (RPWM), the EMI effect can be reduced and implementation of the proposed control scheme into a boost power converter also improves the harmonic spectrum. Such an approach enables the control of the levels of spectral lines in harmonic spectra. Simulated and measured current spectra, with and without random modulation, are shown in this paper. Such random modulated boost converters have improved harmonic spectra and reduced EMI characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.1997.648948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.1997.648948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14143","startPage":"268","endPage":"273 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ISIE '97 Proceeding of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/5230/14143/00648948.pdf","publicationTitle":"ISIE '97 Proceeding of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=648948","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Electromagnetic interference","Pulse width modulation converters","Active filters","Frequency","Power generation","Power electronics","Circuits","Pulse width modulation","Power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomized pulse width modulation","boost power converter","harmonic spectrum improvement","electromagnetic interference","di/dt","dv/dt","EMI characteristics","spectral lines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Random modulated boost converter with improved harmonic spectrum","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5850292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/648948/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random modulated boost converter with improved harmonic spectrum","confLoc":"Guimaraes, Portugal","sourcePdf":"00648948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034655S","chronDate":"7-11 Jul 1997","isNumber":"14143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230","citationCount":"5","articleId":"648948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":648957,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

Body propulsive action is basically continued according with the command unless a problem arises. When a foot reaches the border of the work space of the leg, the body propulsive actions is interrupted and a supporting foot pattern is changed. That is, a foot's arrival at the border is considered as an event to trigger a recovery action for the body propulsion. The recovery actions are decided to converge to the intermittent crawl gait when straight walking command is continued.

One reason is to improve benchmark universality by demanding resources every computer is likely to have. But users dynamically increase the size of application programs to match the power available, whereas most benchmarks are static and of a size appropriate for computers available when the benchmark was created; this is particularly true for parallel computers. Thus, the benchmark overstates computer performance since smaller problems spend more time in cache. Scalable benchmarks, such as HINT, examine the full spectrum of performance through various memory regimes, and express a superset of the information given by any particular fixed size benchmark. Using 5000 experimental measurements, we have found that performance on the NAS Parallel Benchmarks, SPEC, LINPACK, and other benchmarks is predicted accurately by subsets of HINT performance curve. Correlations are typically better than 0.995, and predicted ranking is often perfect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-9 Jan. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"5850101","volume":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Conventional benchmarks as a sample of the performance spectrum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conventional benchmarks as a sample of the performance spectrum","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00649247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035682S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5217","citationCount":"9","articleId":"649247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":649248,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Load balancing algorithms for an HCE attempt to improve the response times for parallel programs by adapting the process scheduling policies on individual machines. The authors propose a priority-based load balancing algorithm, the priority algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the quality of service for the processes of a parallel program by detecting dependences among them. Process migration, the most successful means to balance load in homogeneous distributed environments, is undesirable in an HCE both because of architectural differences between machines and because it conflicts with the HCE goal of matching code to machines. They use simulation to evaluate the speedup of the algorithm on synthetic parallel programs under different background load conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Distributed computing","Computer architecture","Computer networks","Concurrent computing","Scheduling algorithm","Delay","Processor scheduling","Heuristic algorithms","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous computing environment","heterogeneous distributed computing","load balancing","parallel program","load balancing algorithms","response times","process scheduling policies","priority-based load balancing algorithm","priority algorithm","quality of service","process migration","machines","architectures","simulation","algorithm speedup","background load conditions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649289","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1998.649289","startPage":"796","endPage":"804 vol.7","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel4/5217/14150/00649289.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1998.649289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649289/","displayDocTitle":"Load balancing in a heterogeneous computing environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan 1998","volume":"7","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5850137","conferenceDate":"9-9 Jan. 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load balancing in a heterogeneous computing environment","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00649289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037334S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan 1998","isNumber":"14150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5217","articleId":"649289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":649316,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Conventional CBR systems have been largely designed as automated problem-solvers for producing a solution to a given problem by adapting the solution to a similar, previously solved problem. Such systems have had limited success in real-world applications. More recently, there has been a search for new paradigms and directions for increasing the utility of CBR systems for decision support. The paper focuses on the synergism between the research areas of CBR and decision support systems (DSSs). A conceptual framework for DSSs is presented and used to develop a taxonomy of three different types of CBR systems: 1) conventional, 2) decision-aiding, and 3) stimulative. The major characteristics of each type of CBR system are explained with a particular focus on decision-aiding and stimulative CBR systems. The research implications of the evolution in the design of CBR systems from automation toward decision-aiding and stimulation are also explored.","doi":"10.1109/69.649316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.649316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14147","startPage":"911","endPage":"922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/69/14147/00649316.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649316","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Artificial intelligence","Spread spectrum communication","Humans","Decision support systems","Intelligent systems","Delta modulation","Intelligent structures","Intelligent agent","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","decision support systems","knowledge based systems","problem solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning systems","automation","decision aiding","stimulation","artificial intelligence","intelligent system building","automated problem solvers","decision support systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Case-based reasoning systems: from automation to decision-aiding and stimulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5820673","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649316/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Case-based reasoning systems: from automation to decision-aiding and stimulation","sourcePdf":"00649316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086775S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isNumber":"14147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"32","articleId":"649316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":649329,"authors":[{"name":"H.

First, this article clarifies mobile-specific requirements for and advantages of applying ATM to mobile infrastructure networks. However, it is risky for network operators en bloc to replace the conventional STM-based infrastructure by ATM. Therefore, this article shows a smooth evolution path for the mobile network infrastructure to convert from conventional STM to ATM as mobile multimedia services mature. Even in future mobile networks, the main traffic may still be voice communications, whose bit rate is too low for efficient use of the radio frequency band. Applying ATM to such very-low-bit-rate mobile voice streams is inefficient due to the delay in filling out the payload of an ATM cell; this \"packetization delay\" degrades the quality of service. This problem can be solved by using a layered cell structure for the mobile ATM network. This cell structure enables the efficient transfer of voice signals ranging from very-low-bit-rate signals to high-speed multimedia signals with little delay. Standardization of this cell structure is progressing in ITU-T and the ATM Forum. Transmission efficiency is estimated by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/35.649329","startPage":"66","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/35/14148/00649329.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.649329","endPage":"73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying ATM to mobile infrastructure networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Applying ATM to mobile infrastructure networks","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5832320","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying ATM to mobile infrastructure networks","sourcePdf":"00649329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046623S","chronDate":"Jan.  1998","isNumber":"14148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"20","articleId":"649329","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":649333,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Despite the presence of serious noise, reliable detection of the QRS complex, and T and P waves is essential for an exact ECG analysis system. ECG analysis methods can be divided into three functional groups: direct methods, transformation methods, and parameter estimation methods. For real-time processing nonsyntactic, neural network based detection is ideal. Both of the selected methods accomplish filtering of the ECG signal. Neural network based adaptive matched filtering is capable of learning and becoming time-varying. These filters estimate the deterministic signal and remove uncorrelated noise with the deterministic signal. This method can produce better results than nonparametric algorithms. These advantages result in lower noise sensitivity and required sampling rate and accuracy at the same detection rate for all the ECG characteristic points.","doi":"10.1109/ITAB.1997.649412","publicationTitle":"Information Technology Applications in Biomedicine.

The controller ensures the global asymptotic tracking and regulation of the first /spl kappa/ states which are in a chain of integrators form and globally uniformly bounded tracking for the remaining states. An application of this methodology for the case of friction compensation in drives containing a compliant transmission between the load and the actuator is presented. The friction model considered is a six parameter dynamic model. This problem is significant because the load side friction is mismatched with the control. The advocated controller does not require knowledge of any of the parameters of friction and is shown to give global asymptotic tracking of the load angle and velocity in the presence of dynamic uncertainties. Simulation results indicate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14185/00649485.pdf","startPage":"4159","endPage":"4164 vol.5","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.649485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.649485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive variable structure control and applications to friction compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive variable structure control and applications to friction compensation","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5877286","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive variable structure control and applications to friction compensation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00649485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030876S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"31","articleId":"649485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":649490,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We use a highly simplified aircraft model that can account for the lift/drag and thrust characteristics of an aircraft under consideration. When thrust is considered an input, this model is differentially flat (and dynamically feedback linearizable) so that the system can be made to follow any reasonable trajectory. Most trajectories will require significant movement of the throttle. Except in close formation, a pilot does not tend to make rapid throttle adjustments. Indeed, many maneuvers are accomplished using a fixed throttle position. The objective is to fly a desired path rather than a (time indexed) trajectory. Although the aircraft model with throttle fixed (thrust predetermined) is no longer differentially flat, we show that the system can still be made to follow any reasonable path. Roughly speaking, an appropriate derivative of the path parametrization variable acts as the missing control allowing flatness-like results to be obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggressive flight maneuvers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1997.649490","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 36th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/5239/14185/00649490.pdf","startPage":"4186","endPage":"4191 vol.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1997.649490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Aggressive flight maneuvers","conferenceDate":"12-12 Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5877291","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggressive flight maneuvers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00649490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03174S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec 1997","isNumber":"14185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5239","citationCount":"43","articleId":"649490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":649495,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The time dependent gain is described by a single ordinary differential equation for the average inversion level of an EDFA with arbitrary number of signal channels with arbitrary power levels and propagation directions. In steady state, this ordinary differential equation becomes a transcendental equation from which many important parameters are derived. Through perturbation analysis of the time dependent model, the output perturbation can be expressed explicitly in terms of the input perturbations, which is useful for tone calculations. Therefore, this set of models can be applied to the steady state, and to large- and small-signal transient states in wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical communication networks with EDFAs. The models are applied to analyze fast power transients in networks of EDFAs.","doi":"10.1109/2944.649527","startPage":"991","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/2944/14165/00649527.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.649527","endPage":"1007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average inversion level, modeling, and physics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Average inversion level, modeling, and physics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5817454","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average inversion level, modeling, and physics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00649527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075279S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"14165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"143","articleId":"649527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":649529,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxing Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Yuxing Zhao","id":"37086976607"},{"name":"J.

SIGCOMM'97, 1997). We report on an analysis of 40000 end-to-end route measurements conducted using repeated \"traceroutes\" between 37 Internet sites. We analyze the routing behavior for pathological conditions, routing stability, and routing symmetry. For pathologies, we characterize the prevalence of routing loops, erroneous routing, infrastructure failures, and temporary outages. We find that the likelihood of encountering a major routing pathology more than doubled between the end of 1994 and the end of 1995, rising from 1.5% to 3.3%. For routing stability, we define two separate types of stability, \"prevalence\", meaning the overall likelihood that a particular route is encountered, and \"persistence\", the likelihood that a route remains unchanged over a long period of time. We find that Internet paths are heavily dominated by a single prevalent route, but that the time periods over which routes persist show wide variation, ranging from seconds up to days. About two-thirds of the Internet paths had routes persisting for either days or weeks. For routing symmetry, we look at the likelihood that a path through the Internet visits at least one different city in the two directions. At the end of 1995, this was the case half the time, and at least one different autonomous system was visited 30% of the time.","doi":"10.1109/90.649563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.649563","endPage":"615","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14084/00649563.pdf","startPage":"601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-end routing behavior in the Internet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649563/","displayDocTitle":"End-to-end routing behavior in the Internet","volume":"5","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5765282","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-end routing behavior in the Internet","sourcePdf":"00649563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049502S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"14084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"332","articleId":"649563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":649565,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

We design hierarchical packet fair queueing (H-PFQ) algorithms to approximate H-GPS by using one-level variable-rate PFQ servers as basic building blocks. By computing the system virtual time and per packet virtual start/finish times in unit of bits instead of seconds, most of the PFQ algorithms in the literature can be properly defined as variable-rate servers. We develop techniques to analyze delay and fairness properties of variable-rate and hierarchical PFQ servers. We demonstrate that in order to provide tight delay bounds with an H-PFQ server, it is essential for the one-level PFQ servers to have small worst-case fair indices (WFI). We propose a new PFQ algorithm called WF/sup 2/Q+ that is the first to have all the following three properties: (1) providing the tightest delay bound among all PFQ algorithms; (2) having the smallest WFI among all PFQ algorithms; and (3) having a relatively low asymptotic complexity of O(log N).

The protocol is designed to handle the lossless transport of ABR traffic, and will be used in the 40 Gb/s Thunder and Lightning testbed being prototyped at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB). An important advantage of the RGVC protocol over previous connection and flow control protocols is that it is suitable for networks in which the switches use FIFO buffers that are shared by multiple sessions. The RGVC protocol ensures lossless communication by coupling link capacity with buffer space, so that when a portion of a buffer at a node is occupied, a proportional fraction of the incoming capacity to that buffer is frozen. Given the constraints on the frozen capacity, an algorithm is executed at each node to allocate the transmission rate to each FIFO buffer so as to maximize capacity utilization. The requirement that the protocol operate with FIFO buffers at the network nodes poses some unique challenges in the design that are not present in rate- and credit-based schemes. Briefly, since several sessions share a common FIFO buffer, per-VC flow control is no longer possible so control over the rate of an individual session is lost. Also, since the contents of the buffers change dynamically, the buffer composition becomes difficult to determine. For the rate-allocation algorithm of the RGVC protocol to be executed, however, the contents of the FIFO buffers at a node must be known, To implement the bookkeeping required, we present two schemes: the measurement-based scheme, where the bookkeeping function is implemented via measurements, done essentially in hardware; and the estimation-based scheme, where the bookkeeping is done analytically via the exchange of control packets between nodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ready-to-go virtual circuit protocol: a loss-free protocol for multigigabit networks using FIFO buffers","doi":"10.1109/90.649570","endPage":"718","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/14084/00649570.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.649570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649570","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Delay","Transport protocols","Communication system traffic control","Lightning","Testing","Prototypes","Communication system control","Switches","Communication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transport protocols","buffer storage","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication congestion control","asynchronous transfer mode","optical fibre networks","channel capacity","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ready to go virtual circuit protocol","loss free protocol","multigigabit networks","FIFO buffers","lossless communication","lossless transport","roundtrip delay","immediate transmission protocol","ABR traffic","Thunder and Lightning testbed","University of California","flow control protocol","connection control protocol","RGVC protocol","link capacity","buffer space","node","frozen capacity constraints","transmission rate allocation","bookkeeping","measurement based scheme","estimation based scheme","fibre optic ATM network","packet transmission","40 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The ready-to-go virtual circuit protocol: a loss-free protocol for multigigabit networks using FIFO buffers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5765289","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ready-to-go virtual circuit protocol: a loss-free protocol for multigigabit networks using FIFO buffers","sourcePdf":"00649570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051252S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"14084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"36","articleId":"649570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":649591,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A helix slow-wave structure is used to bunch a linearly streaming annular electron beam. A nonadiabatic magnetic transition, which is placed after a drift region at the point where the ac beam current is nearly maximized, converts much of the beam's axial momentum to rotational momentum. The beam then travels through a tapered right-circular waveguide, where microwave energy is extracted via the gyrotron interaction. The design of a proof-of-principle X-band amplifier is given, and the codes that are used in the simulation are described. The nominal beam voltage and current are 45 kV and 8 A, respectively.

Capacity increases are possible because the high output powers afforded by optical-fiber amplifiers support higher bit rates, while their broad bandwidth and slow gain dynamics allow multichannel operation. This benefit comes at the expense of having to manage signal-to-noise ratio degradations due to the accumulation of amplifier noise and dispersion distortions accumulated over the total system link. Furthermore, nonlinear optical effects become significant with the use of high power signals over long lengths of fiber, causing cross talk among the different channels and increasing signal distortions. To fully exploit the potential capacity of wavelength division multiplexing systems, the optical characteristics of the fibers and optical-fiber amplifiers must be optimized. The optical amplifiers should have low noise and flat gain, which can be achieved by using 980-nm pump lasers, optimized fiber glass composition, and gain-flattening filters. The optical fibers should have a small nonzero dispersion and large effective area. Both features can be achieved by optimizing the fiber index profile. This paper summarizes the state of the art in these components and points to directions for future exploration.","doi":"10.1109/5.649655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.649655","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1779","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/14175/00649655.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical fibers and amplifiers for WDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Optical fibers and amplifiers for WDM systems","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"85","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5771945","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649655/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical fibers and amplifiers for WDM systems","sourcePdf":"00649655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073813S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"14175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"11","articleId":"649655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":649657,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The free-space microoptical bench and the concept of optical prealignment are introduced. Examples of micromachined optical devices are described, including optical switches with low loss and high contract ratio, low-cost modulators, micromechanical scanners, and the XYZ micropositioners with large travel distance and fine positioning accuracy.

The algorithm is known in information theory as the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm and is used for constructing a shortest linear recurrence relation for a finite sequence of numbers.","doi":"10.1109/9.649704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/14081/00649704.pdf","startPage":"1554","endPage":"1558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.649704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On constructing a shortest linear recurrence relation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"On constructing a shortest linear recurrence relation","volume":"42","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5763574","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649704/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On constructing a shortest linear recurrence relation","sourcePdf":"00649704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056585S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"14081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"20","articleId":"649704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":649718,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For a given code, the proposed algorithm yields nearly the same error performance as the VA while requiring a substantially smaller average number of computations. Unlike most of the other suboptimum algorithms, this algorithm is self-synchronizing. If the transmitted path is discarded, the adaptive Viterbi algorithm (AVA) can recover the state corresponding to the transmitted path after a few trellis depths. Using computer simulations over hard and soft 3-bit quantized additive white Gaussian noise channels, it is shown that codes with a constraint length K up to 11 can be used to improve the bit-error performance over the VA with K=7 while maintaining a similar average number of computations. Although a small variability of the computational effort is present with our algorithm, this variability is exponentially distributed, leading to a modest size of the input buffer and, hence, a small probability of overflow.","doi":"10.1109/26.649755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14082/00649755.pdf","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.649755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes over memoryless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes over memoryless channels","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5770654","volume":"45","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes over memoryless channels","sourcePdf":"00649755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039531S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"60","articleId":"649755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":649760,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Yi Kuo","affiliation":["Radio Technology Performance Group Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Wen-Yi Kuo","id":"37346693500"},{"name":"M.P.

In this paper, multiwavelength optical orthogonal codes (MWOOCs), which consist of two-dimensional codewords (or matrices) with every pulse of a codeword encoded in a distinct wavelength, are constructed for this scheme. MWOOCs have larger cardinality than the one-dimensional codes used in the hybrid wavelength-division multiple-access (WDMA) and CDMA scheme. With the same hardware configuration, our analysis shows that the multiwavelength scheme, in general, performs better than the hybrid scheme, particularly when the traffic load is heavy. However, if a central controller (i.e., under the best scenario) is used to uniformly distribute all available wavelengths to simultaneous users in the hybrid scheme, both schemes have comparable performance for a medium traffic load and the hybrid scheme can theoretically achieve error-free transmission when the load is light. In addition, using multiple wavelengths, the requirements of fiber ribbons and multiple stars in temporal/spatial optical CDMA networks are eliminated.","doi":"10.1109/26.649764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.649764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14082/00649764.pdf","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of multiwavelength CDMA and WDMA+CDMA for fiber-optic networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of multiwavelength CDMA and WDMA+CDMA for fiber-optic networks","volume":"45","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5770658","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of multiwavelength CDMA and WDMA+CDMA for fiber-optic networks","sourcePdf":"00649764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032129S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"173","articleId":"649764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":649766,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Because of their relatively good performance, large quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations are being used in many of these applications. One of the problems associated with the use of large QAM constellations is that of carrier acquisition, which, for efficiency reasons, must often be done without the use of a preamble. The problem is further complicated for cross constellations, for which the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) corner points used by some simple carrier phase estimators are not available. We derive simple algorithms for carrier phase acquisition that can be used for both square and cross constellations, and compare their performance to those of the maximum-likelihood (ML), the fourth-power estimator, and a modified fourth-power estimator, obtained by considering a reduced constellation. The introduced algorithms convert the problem of carrier phase estimation into one of estimating the mode of an underlying distribution. An expression for this underlying distribution is also obtained. The results obtained indicate that the introduced algorithms significantly outperform the fourth-power estimator for moderate to high SNRs, especially when cross constellations are used.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/14082/00649778.pdf","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.649778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.649778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind carrier phase acquisition for QAM constellations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Frequency synchronization","Phase estimation","Constellation diagram","Maximum likelihood estimation","Phase shift keying","Digital TV","Throughput","Bandwidth","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","phase estimation","synchronisation","maximum likelihood estimation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind carrier phase acquisition","cross constellations","bandwidths","performance","high-speed applications","digital TV","throughput-efficient modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","large QAM constellations","high signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","carrier phase estimator","algorithms","square constellations","maximum-likelihood estimator","fourth-power estimator","modified fourth-power estimator","carrier phase estimation","distribution","synchronisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","displayDocTitle":"Blind carrier phase acquisition for QAM constellations","volume":"45","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5770663","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind carrier phase acquisition for QAM constellations","sourcePdf":"00649778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039523S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"56","articleId":"649778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":649788,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

In MDFE, the entire tree-search is replaced with a 2-tap transversal filter and a binary comparator with negligible loss in performance. This 2-tap filter can be combined with the forward and feedback equalizers resulting in a structure that is physically identical to DFE but requires very different equalizer settings. This paper focuses on equalizer design for MDFE. It is first shown that the MDFE scheme can also be derived without using the principle of tree-search by exploiting the run-length constraints imposed by the RLL(1,k) code in conjunction with the maximization of an appropriately defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recognizing that a multilevel eye Is formed at the comparator, we define this SNR as the eye-opening divided by noise plus intersymbol interference. This formulation directly leads to a novel adaptive scheme based on the well known LMS algorithm. The relationship between this work and the earlier derivation of MDFE is then clarified. We also develop a noniterative analytical approach for the optimum equalizer design. Because of the economy of implementation, there is particular interest in the design of continuous-time forward equalizers. A noniterative analytic design approach, which does not suffer from local minima problems, is developed for such equalizers. Computer simulation results are presented for comparing the different design approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5777061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Design of multilevel decision feedback equalizers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multilevel decision feedback equalizers","sourcePdf":"00649891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038891S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"14155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","articleId":"649891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":649892,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.

The technique includes the effect of imperfect equalization and, in the PR4 case, the effect of employing two interleaved Viterbi detectors. Assuming the Lorentzian channel model and superposition, we use this technique to compare these signaling schemes at medium and high recording densities. It is observed that, even with the trivial DC-free code employed, PR1 is superior to PR4 at recording densities beyond about S/sub c/=2.4 and superior to EPR4 beyond about S/sub c/=2.9. In addition, PR1 lends itself to difference metric Viterbi detection.

The proposed fuzzy adaptive learning control network (FALCON) can be contrasted with traditional fuzzy control systems in network structure and learning ability. An online structure/parameter learning algorithm, FALCON-ART, is proposed for constructing FALCON dynamically. It combines backpropagation for parameter learning and fuzzy ART for structure learning. FALCON-ART partitions the input state space and output control space using irregular fuzzy hyperboxes according to the data distribution. In many existing fuzzy or neural fuzzy control systems, the input and output spaces are always partitioned into \"grids\". As the number of variables increases, the number of partitioned grids grows combinatorially. To avoid this problem in some complex systems, FALCON-ART partitions the I/O spaces flexibly based on data distribution. It can create and train FALCON in a highly autonomous way. In its initial form, there is no membership function, fuzzy partition, and fuzzy logic rule. They are created and begin to grow as the first training pattern arrives. Thus, the users need not give it any a priori knowledge or initial information. FALCON-ART can online partition the I/O spaces, tune membership functions, find proper fuzzy logic rules, and annihilate redundant rules dynamically upon receiving online data.","doi":"10.1109/91.649900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/14172/00649900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.649900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14172","startPage":"477","endPage":"496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ART-based fuzzy adaptive learning control network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An ART-based fuzzy adaptive learning control network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5765295","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ART-based fuzzy adaptive learning control network","sourcePdf":"00649900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037575S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"159","articleId":"649900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":649903,"authors":[{"name":"Daijin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Daijin Kim","id":"37087142593"},{"name":"Chulhyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chulhyun Kim","id":"37087438588"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"649903","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":848},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Predictive models","Fuzzy systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Economic forecasting","Weather forecasting","Exchange rates","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forecasting theory","time series","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forecasting time series","genetic fuzzy predictor ensemble","GFPE","chaotic time series","nonstationary time series","genetic algorithms","fine-tuned membership functions","input-output variables","multiple fuzzy predictors","equal prediction error weighting method","Mackey-Glass chaotic time series","nonstationary foreign currency exchange rate prediction problem","root mean squared error","RMSE","I/O variables"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649903","abstract":"This paper proposes a genetic fuzzy predictor ensemble (GFPE) for the accurate prediction of the future in the chaotic or nonstationary time series.

The first stage generates a fuzzy rule base that covers as many of training examples as possible. The second stage builds fine-tuned membership functions that make the prediction error as small as possible. These two design stages are repeated independently upon the different partition combinations of input-output variables. The prediction error will be reduced further by invoking the GFPE that combines multiple fuzzy predictors by an equal prediction error weighting method. Applications to both the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series and the nonstationary foreign currency exchange rate prediction problem are presented.

Gait achieved through functional electrical stimulation (FES) of paraplegics was divided using sensor measurements of kinematic variables as inputs to five discrete events. Two identification algorithms were used to estimate the system model. Both max-min and max-product composition were used. Membership functions were either trapezoidal or triangular and all membership functions in a particular universe of discourse had the same shape and size. The universe of discourse was varied by altering the overlap between membership functions. The classification performance was assessed quantitatively, by measuring the percentage of time steps in which the correct event was found, and qualitatively, by observing types of errors. The identification algorithm affected system performance. No difference in classification was found between max-min and max-product composition. The performance was dependent on membership function overlap. A comparison of the classification found using the fuzzy rule base versus that found using a traditional look-up table demonstrated that the fuzzy approach was superior. It is speculated that the use of fuzzy logic decreased errors stemming from sensor noise and/or small variations in the input signals. The performance of this approach was compared to that of a feedforward neural network and the fuzzy system is found superior.","doi":"10.1109/91.649904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/14172/00649904.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.649904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy model identification for classification of gait events in paraplegics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649904/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy model identification for classification of gait events in paraplegics","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","accessionNumber":"5765299","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy model identification for classification of gait events in paraplegics","sourcePdf":"00649904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030171S","chronDate":"Nov 1997","isNumber":"14172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"55","articleId":"649904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":649905,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Several different cases are presented using functions that allow the determination of the actual importance of effects. The impact of noisy data on the results is considered for each case. It is shown that in many cases the fuzzy logic model (FLM) ranking methodology is capable of ranking process effects in the exact order or in an order reasonably close to the exact order.

The Adept One Robot was simulated as a three-axis manipulator with the dynamics of the tool (fourth link) neglected and the mass of the load incorporated into the mass of the third link. For simplicity, only the first two joints of the manipulator were considered in the simulation study. The overall performance of the control system under different conditions, namely, trajectory tracking, variations in trajectory and different initial weight values were studied and comparison made with the existing feedback error learning control strategy.

Instead of using an externally connected MPPT, it is proposed to use an integrated MPPT converter as part of the PV panel. It is proposed that this integrated MPPT uses a simple controller in order to be cost effective. Furthermore, the power converter has to be very efficient, in order to transfer more energy to the load than a directly-coupled system. This is achieved by using a simple soft-switched topology. A much higher conversion efficiency at lower cost will then result, making the MPPT an affordable solution for small PV energy systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5782461","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Integrated photovoltaic maximum power point tracking converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated photovoltaic maximum power point tracking converter","sourcePdf":"00649937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058346S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"352","articleId":"649937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":649938,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

This protocol outperforms standard CSMA/CD and token-passing protocols, as well as other hybrid protocols, in terms of mean and maximum packet delays versus throughput. Also, GIT-CSMA/CD offers bounded packet delay and a great degree of adaptation to the varying requirements imposed by the user applications. A seven-node pilot network was set up and its experimental performance evaluated. The implementation of the network node is based on the existing microcontroller technology (INTEL 80C3152 Communication Controller) and field programmable gate array (FPGA) logic (XILINX XC3190). The measurements carried out in real time on a 1-Mb/s LAN yielded reproducible results. The comparison between the experimental and the simulation results showed excellent agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a MAC-layer protocol (GIT-CSMA/CD) for industrial LAN's and its experimental performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.649944","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/41/14174/00649944.pdf","startPage":"825","endPage":"839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.649944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a MAC-layer protocol (GIT-CSMA/CD) for industrial LAN's and its experimental performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5782468","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a MAC-layer protocol (GIT-CSMA/CD) for industrial LAN's and its experimental performance","sourcePdf":"00649944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036248S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"9","articleId":"649944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":649946,"authors":[{"name":"A. de la Escalera","affiliation":["Area de Ingenieria de Sistemas y Automatica, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"de la Escalera","id":"37281517900"},{"name":"L.E.

The first two have been studied for many years and with many good results, but traffic sign recognition is a less-studied field. Traffic signs provide drivers with very valuable information about the road, in order to make driving safer and easier. The authors think that traffic signs most play the same role for autonomous vehicles. They are designed to be easily recognized by human drivers mainly because their color and shapes are very different from natural environments. The algorithm described in this paper takes advantage of these features. It has two main parts. The first one, for the detection, uses color thresholding to segment the image and shape analysis to detect the signs. The second one, for the classification, uses a neural network. Some results from natural scenes are shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5782470","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Road traffic sign detection and classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Road traffic sign detection and classification","sourcePdf":"00649946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047332S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"14174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"343","articleId":"649946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":649968,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The paper presents a detailed development of a mathematical model which can be used to examine both porosity and soldering defects in cage rotors. In the experimental investigation, the UMP developed by a number of nominally identical motors that were known to have rotor defects was measured using a specially designed test rig. The rotors were then divided into two equal groups. The rotor bars in the first group were removed from the rotors and their resistance measured to determine the range and distribution of porosity defects around the periphery of the rotor. The ovality of the rotors of the second group was carefully measured, and their end rings were turned off to enable the bar-to-bar resistance to be measured. This was done for all pairs of adjacent bars in the rotors of the second group, giving again an indication of the range and circumferential distribution of soldering defects.","doi":"10.1109/28.649968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/28/14160/00649968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.649968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14160","startPage":"1553","endPage":"1562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotor cage anomalies and unbalanced magnetic pull in single-phase induction motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rotor cage anomalies and unbalanced magnetic pull in single-phase induction motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5790538","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotor cage anomalies and unbalanced magnetic pull in single-phase induction motors","sourcePdf":"00649968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053236S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isNumber":"14160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"16","articleId":"649968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":649970,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

Fault conditions in induction machines cause the magnetic field in the airgap of the machine to be nonuniform. This results in harmonics in the stator current of the motor which can be measured in order to determine the health of the motor. However, variations in the load torque which are not related to the health of the machine typically have exactly the same effect on the load current. Previously presented schemes for current-based condition monitoring ignore the load effect or assume it is known. Therefore, a scheme for determining machine health in the presence of a varying load torque requires some method for separating the two effects. This is accomplished by comparing the actual stator current to a model reference value which includes the load effects. The difference between these two signals provides a filtered quantity, independent of variations of the load, that allows continuous on-line condition monitoring to be conducted without concern for the load condition. Simulation and test results illustrate the effects on the spectrum of the monitored quantity for both constant and eccentric airgaps when in the presence of an oscillating load.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/28/14160/00649970.pdf","startPage":"1571","endPage":"1577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.649970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.649970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation and implementation of a system to eliminate arbitrary load effects in current-based monitoring of induction machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Induction machines","Stators","Torque","Magnetic field measurement","Power harmonic filters","Electrical fault detection","Frequency","Industry Applications Society","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","electric current measurement","monitoring","air gaps","magnetic fields","stators","harmonic analysis","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary load effects elimination","current-based monitoring","induction machines","fault conditions","magnetic field","airgap","stator current harmonics","motor health determination","load current effect","current-based condition monitoring","varying load torque","continuous on-line condition monitoring","eccentric airgaps","oscillating load","induction motor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation and implementation of a system to eliminate arbitrary load effects in current-based monitoring of induction machines","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5790540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation and implementation of a system to eliminate arbitrary load effects in current-based monitoring of induction machines","sourcePdf":"00649970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037058S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isNumber":"14160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"135","articleId":"649970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":649974,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

On the other hand, taxonomy tests based on DNA composition, although sensitive and reliable, require long execution times and high costs, A method is presented for the classification of fatty-acid profiles, extracted from marine bacteria strains, at genus level based on supervised artificial neural networks. The proposed method allows the correct identification of all patterns belonging to the training set and almost all patterns belonging to the test set. Moreover, a quantitative measure of the importance of each fatty acid for bacterial classification is also achieved. This measure allows the determination of a cluster of fatty acids to be controlled with greater care. The results show that the proposed method is reproducible and rapid, so that it can be routinely used in the marine microbiology laboratory to identify fresh isolates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5783529","pubMedId":"9424456","volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network identification of heterotrophic marine bacteria based on their fatty-acid composition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network identification of heterotrophic marine bacteria based on their fatty-acid composition","sourcePdf":"00649990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083572S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"12","articleId":"649990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":649992,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

Because the use of radio telemetry in a proposed system utilizing this chip may impose limits upon the rate of data transmission to the chip, the scheme described herein was used to reduce the amount of digital information which must be sent to control a large quantity (up to several hundred) of stimulating electrodes. By incorporating multiple current sources on chip, many channels may be stimulated simultaneously. By incorporating on-chip timers, control over pulse timing is assigned to the chip, reducing by up to fourfold the amount of control data which must be sent. By incorporating on-chip RAM, information associated with the desired stimulus amplitude and pulse timing can be stored on chip, In this manner, it is necessary to send control information to the chip only when the information changes, rather than at the stimulus repeat rate for each channel. This further reduces the data rate by a factor of five to ten times or more. The architecture described here, implemented as an eight-channel stimulator, is scalable to a 625-channel stimulator while keeping data transmission rates under 2 Mbps.","doi":"10.1109/10.649992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14156/00649992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.649992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14156","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An advanced demultiplexing system for physiological stimulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An advanced demultiplexing system for physiological stimulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5783531","pubMedId":"9401220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An advanced demultiplexing system for physiological stimulation","sourcePdf":"00649992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05369S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"43","articleId":"649992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":649996,"authors":[{"name":"Mingni Sun","affiliation":["Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Mingni Sun","id":"37087567875"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"649996","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":441},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductors","Brain modeling","Electroencephalography","Head","Scalp","Electric potential","Bioelectric phenomena","Polynomials","Conductivity","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","Legendre polynomials","brain models","inverse problems","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG dipole source localization","multishell spherical volume conductor models computation","efficient algorithm","theoretical scalp potentials","dipolar source","modeled brain","closed-form approximation","Legendre polynomials","electrodiagnostics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Computer Simulation","Costs and Cost Analysis","Electroencephalography","Electroencephalography","Electrophysiology","Head","Humans","Models, Neurological","Scalp"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649996","doi":"10.1109/10.649996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.649996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14156/00649996.pdf","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algorithm for computing multishell spherical volume conductor models in EEG dipole source localization","abstract":"Computationally localizing electrical current sources of the electroencephalographic signal requires a volume conductor model which relates theoretical scalp potentials to the dipolar source located within the modeled brain.

This paper provides a closed-form approximation to this sum based on an optimal fitting to the weights of the Legendre polynomials. The second-order (third-order) approximation algorithm, implemented by a provided C-routine, requires only 100 (140) floating point operations to compute a single scalp potential in response to an arbitrary current dipole located within a four-shell spherical volume conductor model. This cost of computation represents only 6.3% (8.9%) of that required by the direct method.

Following beat delineation, the periods of the beats are normalized by multirate processing. After amplitude normalization, a discrete wavelet transform is applied to each beat. Due to the period and amplitude normalization, the wavelet transform coefficients bear a high correlation across beats at identical locations. To increase the compression ratio, the residual sequence obtained after linear prediction of the significant wavelet coefficients is transmitted to the decoder. The difference between the actual period and the mean beat period, and that between the actual scale factor and the average amplitude scale factor are also transmitted for each beat. At the decoder, the inverse wavelet transform is computed from the reconstructed wavelet transform coefficients. The original amplitude and period of each beat are then recovered. The approximation achieved, at an average rate of 180 b/s, is of high quality. The authors have evaluated the normalized maximum amplitude error and its position in each cycle, in addition to the normalized root mean square error. The significant feature of the proposed technique is that, while the error is nearly uniform throughout the cycle, the diagnostically crucial QRS region is kept free of maximal reconstruction error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG coding by wavelet-based linear prediction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.649997","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14156/00649997.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.649997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","displayDocTitle":"ECG coding by wavelet-based linear prediction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5783536","pubMedId":"9401225","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG coding by wavelet-based linear prediction","sourcePdf":"00649997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056773S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"89","articleId":"649997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":649999,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

An automated way of revealing the diagnostic character of DAS by isolating them from VS, based on their nonstationarity, is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm combines multiresolution analysis with hard thresholding in order to compose a wavelet transform-based stationary-nonstationary filter (WTST-NST). Applying the WTST-NST filter to fine/coarse crackles and squawks, selected from three lung sound databases, the coherent structure of DAS is revealed and they are separated from VS. When compared to other separation tools, the WTST-NST filter performed more accurately, objectively, and with lower computational cost. Due to its simple implementation it can easily be used in clinical medicine.","doi":"10.1109/10.649999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/14156/00649999.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.649999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=14156","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separation of discontinuous adventitious sounds from vesicular sounds using a wavelet-based filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=649999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Separation of discontinuous adventitious sounds from vesicular sounds using a wavelet-based filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/649999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5783538","pubMedId":"9401227","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separation of discontinuous adventitious sounds from vesicular sounds using a wavelet-based filter","sourcePdf":"00649999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034135S","chronDate":"Dec.  1997","isNumber":"14156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"94","articleId":"649999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"}]
