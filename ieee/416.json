A key step forward is the realization that in mobile handsets, it is enough to receive one channel with any bandwidth, situated in any band. Thus, the front-end can be tuned electronically. Taking a cue from a digital front-end, the receiver's flexible analog baseband samples the channel of interest at zero IF, and is followed by clock-programmable downsampling with embedded filtering. This gives a tunable selectivity that exceeds that of an RF prefilter, and a conversion rate that is low enough for A/D conversion at only milliwatts. The front-end consists of a wideband low noise amplifier and a mixer tunable by a wideband LO.

The sensing circuit utilizes an advanced cross-coupled sense amplifier to achieve excellent immunity against mismatch effect and reduction of power consumption. As well, it acts as data latch during multilevel sensing and verifying operations. By comparing to the conventional and simultaneous verifying circuits, the proposed scheme with dichotomous architecture simplifies the verifying circuit and speeds up verification process for multilevel operation.

This paper describes the second generation of single-chip TX and RX MMICs together with work on packaging (e.g., flip-chip) and system measurements. Compared to the first generation of the designs in a commercial pHEMT technology, the MMICs presented in this paper show the same high level of integration but occupy smaller chip area and have higher gain and output power at only half the DC power consumption. The system operates with a LO signal in the range of 7-8 GHz. This LO signal is multiplied in an integrated multiply-by-eight (X8) LO multiplier chain, resulting in an IF center frequency of 2.5 GHz. Packaging and interconnects are discussed and as an alternative to wire bonding, flip-chip assembly tests are presented and discussed.

We have implemented a low-power and low-noise readout front-end with configurable characteristics for Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyogram (EMG) signals. Key to its performance is the new AC-coupled chopped instrumentation amplifier (ACCIA), which uses a low power current feedback instrumentation amplifier (IA). Thus, while chopping filters the 1/f noise of CMOS transistors and increases the CMRR, AC coupling is capable of rejecting differential electrode offset (DEO) up to plusmn50 mV from conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. The ACCIA achieves 120 dB CMRR and 57 nV/radicHz input-referred voltage noise density, while consuming 11.1 muA from a 3 V supply. The chopping spike filter (CSF) stage filters the chopping spikes generated by the input chopper of ACCIA and the digitally controllable variable gain stage is used to set the gain and the bandwidth of the front-end.

A blocker detection technique makes it possible to automatically adjust the power dissipation depending on the absence of presence of blockers, with low overhead in power consumption and circuit complexity. The scheme achieves a fast ramp-up, avoiding diminution of the desired signal response that could otherwise be caused by abruptly appearing large blockers. To ensure the stability of the dynamically biased class-AB opamp employed, a cascode Miller/feedforward compensation technique is used. A fifth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with adaptive IIP3 and adaptive power dissipation is demonstrated, with a test chip implemented in a 0.18-mum CMOS process with a 1.8-V supply. The filter quiescent current is 1.2 mA in the absence of blockers, with a -5 dBV out-of-channel IIP3.

While this was at first motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in perovskite Cu oxides, this technological breakthrough was soon applied to other transition-metal oxides and, notably, mixed-valence manganites. The discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in manganite films triggered intense research activity on these materials, but the first notable impact of magnetic oxides in the field of spintronics was the use of such manganites as electrodes in magnetic tunnel junctions, yielding tunnel magnetoresistance ratios that are one order of magnitude larger than what had been obtained with transition-metal electrodes. Since then, research on oxide spintronics has been intense, with the latest developments focused on diluted magnetic oxides and, more recently, on multiferroics. In this paper, the most important results on oxide spintronics was reviewed, emphasizing materials physics as well as spin-dependent transport phenomena, and finally give some perspectives on how the flurry of new magnetic oxides could be useful for next-generation spintronics devices","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oxide Spintronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.894366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4160089/04160091.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.894366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4160089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Oxide Spintronics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4160091/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9412426","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oxide Spintronics","sourcePdf":"54ted05-bibes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.430837S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4160089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"300","xplore-issue":"4160089","articleId":"4160091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4160095,"authors":[{"name":"Murshed M.

In the limited feedback scenario, optimal precoder representation for narrowband MIMO systems using moderately sized codebooks designed on the Grassmann manifold has been shown to perform remarkably well. In MIMO-OFDM systems, precoder matrices have to be designed for all subcarriers and the amount of feedback can get prohibitively large. This is especially true for next generation wireless local area networks and wireless metropolitan area networks which have a large number of subcarriers. In this paper, we present techniques to reduce this feedback requirement and the performance of these algorithms is numerically shown to provide improvement over existing schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Antenna feeds","MIMO","Wireless LAN","Transmitters","OFDM","Diversity methods","Transmitting antennas","Frequency diversity","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced feedback MIMO-OFDM precoding","antenna selection","multiple-input-multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","diversity gains","multiple-transmit multiple-receive antenna system","frequency selective environment","limited feedback scenario","optimal precoder representation","narrowband MIMO systems","Grassmann manifold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna subset selection","closed-loop multiple- input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","geodesics","interpolation","limited feedback","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160202","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.890936","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4156355/04160202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.890936","startPage":"2284","endPage":"2293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4156355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Feedback MIMO-OFDM Precoding and Antenna Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Feedback MIMO-OFDM Precoding and Antenna Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160202/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 April 2007","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4160202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9427751","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Feedback MIMO-OFDM Precoding and Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"55tsp05-pande-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080752S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4156355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4156355","articleId":"4160202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4160228,"authors":[{"name":"Albrecht Mayer","affiliation":["Emulation architectures, Infineon Technologies"],"bio":{"p":["Albrecht Mayer is principal engineer for emulation architectures at Infineon Technologies.

The structure of microfluidic chip is consisted of top glass, a micro channel with cylindrical post array, two Au end electrodes and bottom glass. Both in-line and staggered arrays of micro cylindrical posts were designed and made of SU-8 inside the micro channel by MEMS technology. The simulated results showed that the applied DC voltage at the end electrodes would generate a non-uniform electric field within the array of cylindrical posts, and particles would be attracted there. From the results of experiment, the minimum required DC voltages to drive micro particles flowing into the micro channel by electrokinetic effect were 15V and 30V, respectively, at the electrode spacing of 8mm and 25mm for both array types. Under the dielectrophoretic effect created by the non-uniform electric field, the latex particles could be concentrated around micro cylindrical posts with electric field intensity minima and separated from flowing fluid. This phenomenon is in agreement with the simulation.","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2007.352052","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160288/4144525/04160355.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","startPage":"430","endPage":"433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2007.352052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Study of Microfluidic Chip with Micro Cylindrical Post Array for Separating Particles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Study of Microfluidic Chip with Micro Cylindrical Post Array for Separating Particles","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160355/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160355/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9562712","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","conferenceDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Study of Microfluidic Chip with Micro Cylindrical Post Array for Separating Particles","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"NEMS-00-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042281S","chronDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160288","isNumber":"4144525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160288","xplore-issue":"4144525","articleId":"4160355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160429,"authors":[{"name":"I-Yu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37295865200"},{"name":"Ming-Jhan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jhan","lastName":"Li","id":"37291660500"},{"name":"Kuan-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291299600"},{"name":"Guo-Yuan Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guo-Yuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37290427500"},{"name":"Kun-Dian She","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Dian","lastName":"She","id":"37294252100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0609-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0610-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4160429","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrication","Bismuth","Micromechanical devices","Tellurium","Reactive power","Design optimization","Reproducibility of results","Cathodes","Control systems","Chromium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antimony compounds","bismuth compounds","chromium alloys","electrical resistivity","electroplating","gold alloys","micromechanical devices","Seebeck effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["column-type microthermoelectric cooler","bismuth telluride pillars","antimony telluride pillars","electroplating","micropillars","electrochemical MEMS technology","hot junctions","cold junctions","Seebeck coefficient","electrical resistivity","mu-TEC device","250 C","Cr-Au","Sb2Te3","Bi2Te3"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160429","abstract":"This paper presents an integrated column-type microthermoelectric cooler (mu-TEC) constructed with serial connected p-type Sb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nTe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n and n-type Bi\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nTe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n micro pillars deposited by electrochemical MEMS technology.

Conventional DRIE and KOH anisotropic etching were used to fabricate the 242 nm thick nano beam from doped (111) Si substrate. High energy argon ion bombardment was then applied on selected area of the top side of the nano beam to destroy the symmetry along thickness direction as atomic bonds were partly broken at top layer. The unbombarded layer underneath could maintain its piezoresistivity. The localized piezoresistor was used to study the resonant response of the double-clamped Si nanobeam in air and vacuum. The resonant frequency and Q-factor were obtained. Frequency shift to low end has been observed. The energy dissipation led by damaged atomic structure is discussed to explain the unexpected low Q factor.","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2007.352142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2007.352142","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160288/4144525/04160445.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Study on Resonant Response of Piezoresistive Double-clamped (111)-Si Nano-beam","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Study on Resonant Response of Piezoresistive Double-clamped (111)-Si Nano-beam","conferenceDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160445/","accessionNumber":"9539766","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160445/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Study on Resonant Response of Piezoresistive Double-clamped (111)-Si Nano-beam","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"NEMS-00-157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068723S","chronDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160288","isNumber":"4144525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160288","xplore-issue":"4144525","articleId":"4160445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4160485,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Hung Wei","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Hung","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085983826"},{"name":"Wen-Syang Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Syang","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37272583300"},{"name":"Shih-Kang Fan","affiliation":["Institute of Nanotechnology, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Kang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37291202200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0609-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0610-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4160485","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Microelectrodes","Electrodes","Indium tin oxide","Voltage","Resistance heating","Heat pumps","Shape","Insulation","Electric resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital circuits","drops","indium compounds","microelectrodes","microfluidics","temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic chips","versatile microelectrodes","electric field","capacitor","surface wettability","pump droplet","parallel plates","Teflon coating","meander-line electrode","bottom plate","droplet manipulation","droplet heating","electrowetting-on-dielectric","In2SnO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EWOD","resistance heater","digital microfluidics"]}],"abstract":"Droplet heating and pumping were performed on a versatile microelectrode by selectively applying appropriate electric signals. The designed electrode is in a meander-line shape and covered by an insulator. On the one hand, when a potential difference is applied along the electrode, power dissipated by the resistance of the electrode causes droplet heating. On the other hand, when an electric field exists across the insulator above the electrode, the charges stored in the capacitor alter the surface wettability and pump droplet. Manipulated droplets were placed between parallel plates with passivated versatile microelectrodes on the bottom plate and a Teflon-coated blank ITO on the top plate. We successfully applied a DC voltage at the two terminals of the meander-line electrode to heat up the electrode as well as the droplet above. Besides, pumping droplets by EWOD was demonstrated by applying a proper AC voltage between the electrode on the bottom plate and the ITO on the top plate. With the proposed versatile microelectrode design and actuation scheme, heating and EWOD were obtained on an identical electrode. A digital microfluidic chip capable of droplet manipulation by EWOD and droplet heating was presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizing Temperature-Controlled Digital Microfluidic Chips with Versatile Microelectrodes","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2007.352182","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160288/4144525/04160485.pdf","startPage":"981","endPage":"984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2007.352182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Realizing Temperature-Controlled Digital Microfluidic Chips with Versatile Microelectrodes","conferenceDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160485/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9539792","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizing Temperature-Controlled Digital Microfluidic Chips with Versatile Microelectrodes","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"NEMS-00-197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096255S","chronDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160288","isNumber":"4144525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160288","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4144525","articleId":"4160485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160503,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Hao","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Hao","id":"37273657300"},{"name":"Jiangbo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jiangbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293674800"},{"name":"Ning Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Xi","id":"37274126400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0609-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0610-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4160503","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic force microscopy","Nanobioscience","Probes","Surface topography","Control systems","Nanoelectromechanical systems","Uncertainty","Systems engineering and theory","Artificial intelligence","Intelligent robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","cantilevers","manipulators","nanotechnology","periodic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infinite dimensional control","flexible cantilevers","AFM","atomic force microscopy","nanomanipulation","active probe","periodic output feedback control","Euler-Bernoulli theory","Linux system","control accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanomanipulation","Active Probe","Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)","Periodic output feedback control"]}],"abstract":"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been extensively used and AFM based nanomanipulation has also been studied for many years. But efficiency and accuracy of AFM based nanomanipulation are still major issues. In order to accurately control the tip position, which is important to prevent the tip from missing the objects, the deformation of cantilever has to be compensated or eliminated during manipulation. An active AFM probe is used to eliminate the deformation of cantilever by directly controlling the cantilever's flexibility or rigidity during manipulation. In this paper, the active probe is modeled as an infinite dimensional system based on Euler-Bernoulli theory. A periodic-output-feedback (POF) controller is designed and simulations are carried out to optimize the parameters of the controller. The POF controller is implemented in a real time Linux system. Experimental results demonstrated the validity of infinite dimensional model and POF controller. Experimental results on nanomanipulation have also shown that the control accuracy of tip position is improved by using this controller of active probe.","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2007.352200","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160288/4144525/04160503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2007.352200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144525","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Infinite Dimensional Control of Flexible Cantilevers in AFM Based Nanomanipulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Infinite Dimensional Control of Flexible Cantilevers in AFM Based Nanomanipulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160503/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9562793","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Infinite Dimensional Control of Flexible Cantilevers in AFM Based Nanomanipulation","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"NEMS-00-215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089182S","chronDate":"16-19 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160288","isNumber":"4144525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160288","xplore-issue":"4144525","articleId":"4160503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160635,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay K.

A non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay constraint. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay, throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified.

The CFOs destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers and cause inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the received signals, and therefore make the \"per-tone\" equalization invalid. Since there are multiple different CFOs, the conventional CFO compensation method for OFDM can no longer be used. In this paper, a method is proposed to incorporate the CFOs into the transmitted symbols and channels, and re-model the MIMO-OFDM with CFOs into a MIMO-OFDM without CFOs. The \"per-tone\" equalization is used to recover the CFO incorporated transmitted signals. Then the real transmitted signals are obtained by depriving the CFOs from them.

The proposed multipolar antennas with mode-decoupling benefit give a clear interpretation of the relations between antenna excitation, pattern, and capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160659/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9443361","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximized Capacity of Coupled Antennas Based on Multipolar Radiations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximized Capacity of Coupled Antennas Based on Multipolar Radiations","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051236S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160672,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Seki","affiliation":["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Seki","id":"37290929600"},{"name":"Kenjiro Nishikawa","affiliation":["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenjiro","lastName":"Nishikawa","id":"37280724600"},{"name":"Ichihiko Toyoda","affiliation":["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichihiko","lastName":"Toyoda","id":"37284669500"},{"name":"Shuji Kubota","affiliation":["Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuji","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37266418200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160672","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":834},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antenna arrays","Microstrip antennas","Aperture antennas","Circuits","Antenna feeds","Millimeter wave technology","MMICs","Band pass filters","Aperture coupled antennas","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ceramic packaging","microstrip antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","substrates","system-in-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTCC substrate","millimeter wave applications","parasitic elements","high-gain millimeter-wave microstrip array antenna","low temperature cofired ceramic","electro-magnetic simulation","radiation efficiency","compact antenna-integrated RF modules","low-cost millimeter-wave system-on-package"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active integrated antenna","multi-layer LTCC substrate","microwave / millimeter-wave","parasitic array antenna","system-on-package"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel high-gain millimeter-wave microstrip array antenna formed on a low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrate.

The system benefits from direct conversion transceiver units, reported before. Channel propagation measurements were performed in a rich multi-path environment by employing a virtual MIMO indoor wireless channel sounding as well as a direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms. The channel sounding technique employs sequential switching of 1times4 single input multiple output (SIMO) channels to realize a virtual 4times4 MIMO experiments in a stationary channel environment. A hardware calibration method is also developed as a critical part of the MIMO evaluation. The DOA experiment, which employs a linear four-element patch antenna array at the receiver and a single patch antenna at the transmitter, provides a maximum of 15 degrees offset using Bartlett algorithm.

Simulations show the algorithm to perform much better than the energy detector. The algorithm does not require an estimate of the noise power. Till date, not much work has been done on blind sensing algorithms in the low SNR regime. Algorithms based on cyclo-stationarity have been developed in previous papers. However, the performance of these algorithms at low SNR (like -10 dB) has not been investigated. Moreover, unlike the previous algorithms, the novel sensing algorithm here does not require information about the multipath channel distortions the primary signal has undergone on its way to reaching the secondary user.

In addition to the computational efficiency it is very important that such an algorithm needs only a low number of predefined parameters for the fitting process.

To verify the performance of the presented algorithm the behavior of a 3-stage RF power amplifier (PA) was identified. The resulting model was validated using different measurements with similar statistical properties. Furthermore the static nonlinear contributions were deembedded from both the measured and the modeled output signals to visualize the capability of the MPCHM in predicting the amplifier memory effects","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2007.351829","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160617/4084713/04160712.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2007.351829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Power Amplifier Identification Using Modified Parallel Cascade Hammerstein Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160712/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Power Amplifier Identification Using Modified Parallel Cascade Hammerstein Models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9453733","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160712/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Power Amplifier Identification Using Modified Parallel Cascade Hammerstein Models","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050087S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4160713,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Yen Cheong","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, TKK, Finland"],"firstName":"Mei Yen","lastName":"Cheong","id":"37267646200"},{"name":"Helka-Liina Maattanen","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, TKK, Finland"],"firstName":"Helka-Liina","lastName":"Maattanen","id":"37403586000"},{"name":"Stefan Werner","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, TKK, Finland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Werner","id":"37267643700"},{"name":"Sven-Gustav Haggman","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, TKK, Finland"],"firstName":"Sven-Gustav","lastName":"Haggman","id":"37267435900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160713","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Nonlinear distortion","OFDM","Table lookup","Partial transmit sequences","Laboratories","Digital video broadcasting","Intersymbol interference","Computational complexity","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined PAPR reduction","predistorter scheme","OFDM systems","nonlinear channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","nonlinear distortion","peak-to-average power ratio","linearization techniques","power amplifiers","clipping distortion","compressive gain distortion","adjacent channel power ratio improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","nonlinear PA","predistorter","PAPR reduction","piecewise linear function"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system is known to be sensitive to nonlinear distortion due to its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Without proper linearization techniques, power efficiency is often compromised to control the nonlinear distortion caused by power amplifiers. The nonlinear distortion caused by a power amplifier is due to clipping distortion and compressive gain distortion. A combined PAPR reduction and predistorter (PD) scheme is proposed to efficiently mitigate both these distortion components. Simulation results show that the combined scheme results in an adjacent channel power ratio improvement which is twice as good as that achieved by the PD. The observed gain in the system total degradation equals the sum of the improvements provided by each method separately.

The original pilot system uses frequency-selective nonlinear positive feedback to generate a pilot tone and IF detection to measure the residual pilot power after the second loop cancellation. It provides information on the magnitude component of the second loop cancellation transfer function. The new system measures the frequency of the generated pilot from which phase information regarding the second loop cancellation transfer function can be inferred. Pilot frequency information converts the original power-based pilot detection into synchronous pilot detection and allows the use of better search algorithms for control of the alignment setting. A novel search algorithm is presented that demonstrates the utility of the pilot frequency measurements. The hardware for the original pilot system exists as part of a commercially available power amplifier. The extension to the pilot system-the measurement of the pilot frequency-is demonstrated using a spectrum analyzer coupled to the RF output. The new algorithm controls the second loop alignment based on the pilot power and frequency measurements. Experimental results show that the search trajectory of the new algorithm is well-damped and converges in a fewer number of iterations than a coordinate descent search.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2007.351831","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160617/4084713/04160714.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2007.351831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Pilot Frequency from a Positive Feedback Pilot System to Improve Second Loop Convergence for a Feedforward Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using the Pilot Frequency from a Positive Feedback Pilot System to Improve Second Loop Convergence for a Feedforward Amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9453735","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160714/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Pilot Frequency from a Positive Feedback Pilot System to Improve Second Loop Convergence for a Feedforward Amplifier","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030557S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4160715,"authors":[{"name":"Chanhoe Koo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chanhoe","lastName":"Koo","id":"37294944700"},{"name":"Unha Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Unha","lastName":"Kim","id":"37301721100"},{"name":"Jooyoung Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jooyoung","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37289925200"},{"name":"Junghyun Kim","affiliation":["Avago Technologies, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junghyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293488100"},{"name":"Youngwoo Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngwoo","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37275614900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160715","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":505},"abstract":"A high-linearity series-type Doherty amplifier that does not use bulky 3 dB quadrature hybrid coupler is developed for mobile handset applications.

The unitary beamforming matrix is the cumulative product of the fed back unitary matrixes for differential feedback. The fed back matrix depicts the incremental change of the beamforming matrix and it is quantized by small vector codebooks. The overhead can be further reduced by complementary feedback for channel with N transmit and M receive antennas, where M is N or N-1. One unit vector is fed back instead of one unitary matrix. The vector corresponds to the complementary subspace of the beamforming subspace for M=N-1 or corresponds to the strongest or weakest singular mode for M=N.

The predistorted amplifier has a RF input that is a UMTS signal comprising one or two adjacent carriers. The predistortion corrects for memoryless distortion. The data acquisition system measures the complex gain of the predistorted amplifier as a function of the input envelope, creating tables of statistical moments from which AM-AM and AM-PM curves and other information useful to an adaptive coefficient estimator can be extracted. A gain detector compares the RF input and output signals directly measuring the differential log-magnitude (DLM) and phase. A second detector measures the input envelope. The challenges associated with a low cost design include using a microcontroller with a slow ADC and limited memory, time alignment of the RF input and output signals at the gain detector, and time alignment of the sampled DLM, phase, and input envelope signals. The detector signals are sampled at a sub-Nyquist rate, significantly below the bandwidth of the input signal, exploiting the memoryless characterization of the amplifier distortion. Separate sample and hold (S/H) circuits are used for each detector signal, allowing a single ADC to be multiplexed. Offset timing between the S/H's is used to compensate for delay differences between the detectors. To reduce the sensitivity to the memoryless approximation and time misalignment at the gain detector, the derivative of the input envelope is also measured and samples associated with high values are rejected. This selective sampling process is shown to reduce the variance within each of the bins of the DLM and phase tables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160738/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9453758","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data Acquisition for Digital-Controlled Adaptive Analog Predistortion of a Power Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Acquisition for Digital-Controlled Adaptive Analog Predistortion of a Power Amplifier","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048487S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4160743,"authors":[{"name":"Kensuke Nakajima","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensuke","lastName":"Nakajima","id":"37291314000"},{"name":"Yukihisa Yoshida","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihisa","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37287590400"},{"name":"Hiroomi Ueda","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroomi","lastName":"Ueda","id":"37291204100"},{"name":"Tamotsu Nishino","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tamotsu","lastName":"Nishino","id":"37282162600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Fukumoto","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Fukumoto","id":"37295860600"},{"name":"Noriharu Suematsu","affiliation":["Information Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriharu","lastName":"Suematsu","id":"37298359500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160743","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Parasitic capacitance","Grounding","Silicon","Epitaxial layers","Impedance","Conductivity","Substrates","Gain","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-band SiGe-MMIC","low noise amplifier","low parasitic capacitance","emitter grounding","single-ended two-stage amplifier","LNA","BiCMOS process","silicon substrate","0.35 mum","21 dB","4.8 dB","11 GHz","19.1 mW","3.3 V","SiGe"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160743","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2007.351860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2007.351860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084713","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160617/4084713/04160743.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X-Band SiGe-MMIC Low Noise Amplifier Using Low Parasitic Capacitance Via Holes for Emitter Grounding","abstract":"An X-band SiGe-MMIC single-ended two-stage low noise amplifier (LNA) using low parasitic capacitance via holes for the emitter grounding is described. In order to obtain low impedance emitter/source ground of a silicon based single-ended amplifier, we have developed via holes which can be fabricated after the 0.35 mum SiGe-BiCMOS process. Since there are low resistivity epitaxial layers in the silicon substrate, the via hole has the large parasitic capacitance. By introducing deep trench isolations to separate the epitaxial layers around a via hole from the other area of the chip, the parasitic capacitance of a via hole can be reduced.

Since a sensor node has a strict energy budget in a WSN, it often enters itself into a standby mode when no communication is required, and hence a standby power have to be suppressed as well as an active power in order to maximize a lifetime of a WSN. For this sake, it is effective to reduce an RF block's power in a sensor node because it is the major power-consuming block. We propose a simple rail-to-rail voltage amplifier with low-standby-power and low-active-power capabilities that is suitable to a subsequent digital interface. The target frequency is set to 433 MHz, and the voltage gain achieves 26 dB. The standby and active powers are 24 nW and 356 \u03bcW, which are lower than the conventional inverter-type voltage amplifier by 86% and 46%, respectively. The proposed amplifier features a carrier sensing function in addition to the low-power operation since it has a minimum input amplitude to be amplified. By using this function, we can set a carrier sensing level as a threshold level, which is important to avoid collisions and interferences in a WSN that cause needless communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2007.351865","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160617/4084713/04160748.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"454","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2007.351865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 356-\u03bcW, 433-MHz, Rail-to-Rail Voltage Amplifier with Carrier Sensing Function for Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A 356-\u03bcW, 433-MHz, Rail-to-Rail Voltage Amplifier with Carrier Sensing Function for Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160748/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9463453","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160748/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 356-\u03bcW, 433-MHz, Rail-to-Rail Voltage Amplifier with Carrier Sensing Function for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07734S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4160751,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya Rahmat-Samii","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yahya","lastName":"Rahmat-Samii","id":"38272988200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160751","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","MIMO","Broadband antennas","Design engineering","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Optimization methods","Cost function","Random processes","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadband antennas","genetic algorithms","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","particle swarm optimisation","personal communication networks","random processes","statistical analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modem antenna designs","nature inspired optimization techniques","multi band MIMO antennas","evolutionary optimization","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimization","statistical random processes","robust stochastic evolutionary computation technique","personal communication antennas","wideband antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna","evolutionary optimizations","genetic algorithms","MIMO","particle swarm optimization"]}],"abstract":"Recent MIMO applications have noticeably magnified the importance of multi antennas.

The combined system is called GMD-THP MIMO system. As the subchannels have identical SNR, it is more convenient for GMD-THP MIMO systems to design modulation/demodulation and coding/decoding schemes than singular value decomposition (SVD) MIMO systems. In this paper, we consider low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded GMD-THP MIMO system. Since the modulo operation at the receiver may generate modulo errors, the log likelihood ratio (LLR) values provided by conventional soft demapper can be very inaccurate. To overcome this problem, we propose an expanded soft demapper scheme to obtain better LLR values, by which significant performance improvement can be achieved for LDPC decoding as compared to conventional soft demapper. Computer simulations are presented to show that the expanded soft demapper indeed improves the error rate performance of the LDPC coded GMD-THP systems and reduces the noise floor caused by the modulo errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160765/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9463470","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160765/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Expanded Soft Demapper for LDPC Coded GMD-THP MIMO System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expanded Soft Demapper for LDPC Coded GMD-THP MIMO System","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089119S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4160766,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Ait-Idir","affiliation":["Signal and Communications Department, ENST-Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Ait-Idir","id":"38265306900"},{"name":"Samir Saoudi","affiliation":["Signal and Communications Department, ENST-Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Saoudi","id":"38262177200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160766","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","MIMO","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Interference cancellation","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Covariance matrix","Noise cancellation","Loaded antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","equalisers","fading channels","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multipath channels","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath MIMO coded systems","equalization","iterative multiuser detection","multiuser space-time transmission","multiple input multiple output channel","multipath channel","fading channel","multiuser interference cancellation","intersymbol interference suppression","ISI suppression","turbo receiver","covariance matrix"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the issue of advanced multiuser detection and equalization for multiuser space-time transmission over multipath multiple input multiple output (MIMO) fading channel.

A concept similar to the standard FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar principle is used to estimate the offset in time and in frequency between two wireless communication units. The novel approach allows for a synchronization of both offsets significantly below 100 ps and 10 Hz, respectively. This highly accurate synchronization is used in a prototype system to measure the distance between wireless units similar to a secondary radar. The prototype works within the 5.8 GHz ISM-band and uses a bandwidth of 150 MHz. With the setup presented we can measure the distance between two radio units with a standard deviation of 4 to 5 cm over a range of 200 m. This distance deviation implies a clock and center frequency synchronization of both communication modules significantly below 100 ps and 1 ppb, respectively. The broadband measurement principle is robust towards multi-path interference. It can be extended to other frequency bands and is well-suited for direct integration into communication channels and novel modulation principles such as OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) or SC/FDE (single carrier transmission with frequency domain equalization), e.g. for locatable WLAN (wireless local area network) devices or wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160773/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9463478","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Method for High Precision Clock Synchronization in Wireless Systems with Application to Radio Navigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Method for High Precision Clock Synchronization in Wireless Systems with Application to Radio Navigation","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035386S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4160774,"authors":[{"name":"Md Habibul Islam","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Md Habibul","lastName":"Islam","id":"38558160100"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0444-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0445-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4160774","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Wireless communication","TV","Downlink","Frequency conversion","Switches","Degradation","Log periodic antennas","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","frequency division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam synthesis method","beamforming adaptation","cognitive radio","wireless communications systems","wireless regional area network","frequency division duplex","FDD","TV channel","TV band"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RWS.2007.351891","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160617/4084713/04160774.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2007.351891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Synthesis Method for Beamforming Adaptation in Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Communications Systems","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an algorithm, namely, beam synthesis (BES) method for updating the beamforming weights from one TV channel to another TV band in cognitive radio based wireless regional area network (WRAN) communications systems.

Non linearity of the RF front end transfers the modulation of the transmitter (TX) leakage onto the ACI, resulting in cross-modulation distortion. In addition to this, if the ACI signal is strong, it would undergo spectral re-growth and some fraction of its power will leak into the adjacent desired channel. The adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) scenarios in the 3GPP RX specification outline the performance requirement for the receiver in the presence of a strong as well as a weak ACI signal. For the ACS high power scenario (in which the ACI signal is strong), the distortion due to ACI leakage is much more significant compared to the cross-modulation distortion. Therefore, understanding the ACI leakage distortion becomes important, in order to ensure reliable receiver performance. In this paper, we analyze and report observations of the ACI leakage phenomenon on a WCDMA receiver chip. Measurement results have also been reported for the 3GPP ACS high power scenario. The chip measurements are supported with time-domain simulation results","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160617/4084713/04160775.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"562","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2007.351892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2007.351892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Distortion Due To Spectral Re-Growth Of Adjacent Channel Interferers in WCDMA Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Multiaccess communication","Semiconductor device measurement","Linearity","Radio frequency","Power measurement","RF signals","Receivers","Instruments","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","adjacent channel interference","code division multiple access","modulation","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal distortion","spectral re-growth","WCDMA receivers","modulated adjacent channel interferers","transmitter","cross-modulation distortion","adjacent channel selectivity","3GPP RX specification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Signal Distortion Due To Spectral Re-Growth Of Adjacent Channel Interferers in WCDMA Receivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9463480","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Distortion Due To Spectral Re-Growth Of Adjacent Channel Interferers in WCDMA Receivers","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"RWS-00-158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054832S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160617","isNumber":"4084713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160617","xplore-issue":"4084713","articleId":"4160775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160804,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Due to their ability to perform complex, multiple tasks with biochemicals, such devices have many applications, especially in the biomedicine area and are expected to continue generating interest. However, due to the need for handling micro-scale flow of liquids and the diverse nature of microfluidic devices, some of the major challenges in their development are the establishment of chip-to-world fluidic interconnects and device packaging. This paper reports on the development of a generic fluidic interconnect methodology based on assembly and plugging-in of the components. This approach greatly simplifies the currently difficult task of implementing fluidic connections and provides an integration capability that facilitates the experimental development of microfluidic devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Thirty-Ninth Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160780/4160781/04160829.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"2007 Thirty-Ninth Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doi":"10.1109/SSST.2007.352343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2007.352343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4160781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Chip-to-World Fluidic Interconnect System for Microfluidic Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Integrated circuit packaging","Micromechanical devices","Integrated circuit interconnections","Fluid flow","Fluidic microsystems","Gases","Microelectromechanical systems","Electronics packaging","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidics","packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip-to-world fluidic interconnect system","microfluidic devices","multiphase flow","microscale channel","microelectromechanical systems","MEMS technology","liquid microscale flow","device packaging","microfluidic packaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fluidic Interconnects","Microfluidic Packaging","Microfluidic Devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Generic Chip-to-World Fluidic Interconnect System for Microfluidic Devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160829/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9572638","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Chip-to-World Fluidic Interconnect System for Microfluidic Devices","confLoc":"Macon, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SSST-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059031S","chronDate":"4-6 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160780","isNumber":"4160781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160780","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4160781","articleId":"4160829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160838,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Jiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering Department, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37269464600"},{"name":"Eric Psota","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Psota","id":"37294719800"},{"name":"Lance C.

Moreover, its decoding complexity becomes prohibitively large when the turbo encoders have very large memories. The sum-product and linear programming decoding algorithms are based on the parity-check matrices of the codes. They are widely used to decode low-density parity-check codes. These algorithms do not suffer the limitations of the turbo iterative decoding algorithm. In order to apply them to the turbo codes, the parity-check matrices of turbo codes must be found. By treating turbo codes as serially concatenated codes, the generator and parity-check matrices of the turbo codes are derived in this paper. Turbo codes with low-density parity-check matrices are then designed based on the derived results. Provided these matrices, turbo codes are decoded using the sum-product algorithms. Preliminary results show that the sum-product decoding of turbo codes performs slightly worse than sum-product decoding of conventional low-density parity-check codes. However, since the encoding of turbo codes has less complexity than the straightforward encoding of low-density parity-check codes, this loss in performance may be justified by the drastically decreased encoding complexity. The availability of the parity-check matrices of turbo codes also makes them ready to be decoded by the linear programming decoding algorithm which is optimum for the given linear constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160838/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9572635","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Turbo Codes Based on Their Parity-Check Matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Turbo Codes Based on Their Parity-Check Matrices","confLoc":"Macon, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SSST-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051254S","chronDate":"4-6 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160780","isNumber":"4160781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160780","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4160781","articleId":"4160838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4160847,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Karam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Karam","id":"37296309800"},{"name":"Mohamed A.

Adaptive harmonic wavelet transform is derived from generalized harmonic wavelet transform by developing its adaptiveness to analyze all kinds of disturbed signals with minimum human interaction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature extraction of Power Quality disturbances using Adaptive Harmonic Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2007 Thirty-Ninth Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","doi":"10.1109/SSST.2007.352362","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Thirty-Ninth Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160780/4160781/04160848.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2007.352362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4160781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction of Power Quality disturbances using Adaptive Harmonic Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4160848/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9572598","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction of Power Quality disturbances using Adaptive Harmonic Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Macon, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SSST-00-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051601S","chronDate":"4-6 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160780","isNumber":"4160781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160780","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4160781","articleId":"4160848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160851,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In recent years, high to ultra high power LED's are becoming a light source option for virtually every automotive lighting system. For exterior automotive lighting, these light sources have distinct advantages, but also unique thermal issues compared to conventional incandescent light sources. This study describes two methods of determining the junction temperature of an LED or array of LED's, direct and indirect. Both are based on temperature measurements, but the indirect method also requires a thermal resistance specified by the manufacturer. The direct method utilizes the intrinsic behavior of the junction voltage drop at low current (<0.1mA). A computer model for a typical plate finned heat sink design for a high power LED automotive lamp was experimentally calibrated. Design of experiment analysis was performed using a 3 level 3 input factor full factorial test matrix. The factors were defined as an active heat sink surface area, convection coefficient correlated to an airflow, and environment temperature. A quadratic model is generated from the results of the factors and significant interactions to the response.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4160868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STHERM.2007.352403","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Third Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Third Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4160867/4160868/04160884.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"43","doi":"10.1109/STHERM.2007.352403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Considerations for LED Components in an Automotive Lamp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Considerations for LED Components in an Automotive Lamp","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160884/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9573608","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Considerations for LED Components in an Automotive Lamp","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"STHERM-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043746S","chronDate":"18-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4160867","isNumber":"4160868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4160867","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4160868","articleId":"4160884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4160945,"authors":[{"name":"Guoying Zhao","affiliation":["Machine Vision Group, Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4160941/4160945/4160945-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guoying Zhao received the MS degree in computer science from North China University of Technology, in 2002 and the PhD degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2005.

Description and recognition of DTs have attracted growing attention. In this paper, a novel approach for recognizing DTs is proposed and its simplifications and extensions to facial image analysis are also considered. First, the textures are modeled with volume local binary patterns (VLBP), which are an extension of the LBP operator widely used in ordinary texture analysis, combining motion and appearance. To make the approach computationally simple and easy to extend, only the co-occurrences of the local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) are then considered. A block-based method is also proposed to deal with specific dynamic events such as facial expressions in which local information and its spatial locations should also be taken into account. In experiments with two DT databases, DynTex and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both the VLBP and LBP-TOP clearly outperformed the earlier approaches. The proposed block-based method was evaluated with the Cohn-Kanade facial expression database with excellent results.

However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem-there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the normalized probabilistic rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms - the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization.

A successive convexification scheme solves the labeling problem in a coarse to fine manner. Importantly, the original cost function is reconvexified at each stage, in the new focus region only, and the focus region is updated so as to refine the searching result.

Canonical correlations offer many benefits in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness compared to the two main classical methods: parametric distribution-based and nonparametric sample-based matching of sets. Here, this is first demonstrated experimentally for reasonably sized data sets using existing methods exploiting canonical correlations. Motivated by their proven effectiveness, a novel discriminative learning method over sets is proposed for set classification. Specifically, inspired by classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA), we develop a linear discriminant function that maximizes the canonical correlations of within-class sets and minimizes the canonical correlations of between-class sets. Image sets transformed by the discriminant function are then compared by the canonical correlations. Classical orthogonal subspace method (OSM) is also investigated for the similar purpose and compared with the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated on various object recognition problems using face image sets with arbitrary motion captured under different illuminations and image sets of 500 general objects taken at different views. The method is also applied to object category recognition using ETH-80 database. The proposed method is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160951/","volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4160951/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9457888","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"17431299","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative Learning and Recognition of Image Set Classes Using Canonical Correlations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative Learning and Recognition of Image Set Classes Using Canonical Correlations","sourcePdf":"i1005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09065S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4160941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"439","xplore-issue":"4160941","articleId":"4160951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160952,"authors":[{"name":"Weiming Hu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4160941/4160952/4160952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiming Hu received the PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University.

However, Web pages with obscene, harmful, or illegal content can be easily accessed. It is important to recognize such unsuitable, offensive, or pornographic Web pages. In this paper, a novel framework for recognizing pornographic Web pages is described. A C4.5 decision tree is used to divide Web pages, according to content representations, into continuous text pages, discrete text pages, and image pages. These three categories of Web pages are handled, respectively, by a continuous text classifier, a discrete text classifier, and an algorithm that fuses the results from the image classifier and the discrete text classifier. In the continuous text classifier, statistical and semantic features are used to recognize pornographic texts. In the discrete text classifier, the naive Bayes rule is used to calculate the probability that a discrete text is pornographic. In the image classifier, the object's contour-based features are extracted to recognize pornographic images. In the text and image fusion algorithm, the Bayes theory is used to combine the recognition results from images and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the continuous text classifier outperforms the traditional keyword-statistics-based classifier, the contour-based image classifier outperforms the traditional skin-region-based image classifier, the results obtained by our fusion algorithm outperform those by either of the individual classifiers, and our framework can be adapted to different categories of Web pages","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Pornographic Web Pages by Classifying Texts and Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4160941/04160952.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4160941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4160952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Pornographic Web Pages by Classifying Texts and Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4160952/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9457889","pubMedId":"17431300","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Pornographic Web Pages by Classifying Texts and Images","sourcePdf":"i1019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147964S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4160941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"4160941","articleId":"4160952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4160954,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the \"pure vision\" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to structure from motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation.

The informal justification for the use of multilegged arguments is similar to that used to support the use of multiversion software in pursuit of high reliability or safety. Just as a diverse 1-out-of-2 system might be expected to be more reliable than each of its two component versions, so might a two-legged argument be expected to give greater confidence in the correctness of a dependability claim (for example, a safety claim) than would either of the argument legs alone. Our intention here is to treat these argument structures formally, in particular, by presenting a formal probabilistic treatment of \"confidence,? which will be used as a measure of efficacy. This will enable claims for the efficacy of the multilegged approach to be made quantitatively, answering questions such as, \"How much extra confidence about a system's safety will I have if I add a verification argument leg to an argument leg based upon statistical testing?? For this initial study, we concentrate on a simplified and idealized example of a safety system in which interest centers upon a claim about the probability of failure on demand. Our approach is to build a \"Bayesian Belief Network? (BBN) model of a two-legged argument and manipulate this analytically via parameters that define its node probability tables. The aim here is to obtain greater insight than what is afforded by the more usual BBN treatment, which involves merely numerical manipulation. We show that the addition of a diverse second argument leg can indeed increase confidence in a dependability claim; in a reasonably plausible example, the doubt in the claim is reduced to one-third of the doubt present in the original single leg. However, we also show that there can be some unexpected and counterintuitive subtleties here; for example, an entirely supportive second leg can sometimes undermine an original argument, resulting, overall, in less confidence than what came from this original argument. Our results are neutral on the issue of whether such difficulties will arise in real life?that is, when real experts judge real systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4160972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4160972/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9578486","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Use of Multilegged Arguments to Increase Confidence in Safety Claims for Software-Based Systems: A Study Based on a BBN Analysis of an Idealized Example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of Multilegged Arguments to Increase Confidence in Safety Claims for Software-Based Systems: A Study Based on a BBN Analysis of an Idealized Example","sourcePdf":"e0347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032399S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4160964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"55","articleId":"4160972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4161009,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel A.

This reduces the information conversion burden on the ADC, allowing the requisite six bits of ADC resolution to be reduced to two, thereby significantly lowering system power consumption. The increased dynamic range allows sensitivity to be improved as weak sub-channels are amplified before quantization and not subjected to the limitations of the conventional 6-bit ADC.

We first divide a given radio resource into a set of subchannels in each cell. Here, we assume an identical set of subchannels in all cells considered. Then, we choose a set of cell-specific subchannel allocation sequences, so that they can avoid maximally inter-cell interference (ICI) and also minimize the probability of major collisions from neighbor cells in a mobile cellular environment. Finally, each cell allocates a subset of pre-defined subchannels to a requested user. In addition, prior to resource scheduling, each base station (BS) determines the total number of subchannels requested by all users in the cell, and allocates subchannels corresponding to the requested number according to its own cell-specific sequence. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve a greater spectral efficiency or much higher loading under system outages as compared to the conventional schemes.

In order to accurately predict both the impedance matching and the noise figure, the modeling methodology captures the impact of parasitics on passive components, ESD-protection structures, and devices. Our design example is a tri-band switchable narrow-band LNA that operates at 900MHz, 2.4GHz and 5.2GHz, representing the GSM, Bluetooth and WLAN standards. Based on our sensitivity analysis, we defined the most effective passive elements that can be used to tune the circuit over the three frequency bands while achieving the required performance and minimizing the number of the switchable elements. Simulation results demonstrate that our automated design methodology achieves the required LNA specifications over the tri-band while providing five orders of magnitude improvement in design space exploration speed over circuit-level based methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-5 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4161077/","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9518815","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parasitic-Aware Analytical Modeling of Fully Integrated Switchable Narrow-Band CMOS Low Noise Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parasitic-Aware Analytical Modeling of Fully Integrated Switchable Narrow-Band CMOS Low Noise Amplifiers","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"WAMICON-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038666S","chronDate":"4-5 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161058","isNumber":"4141009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161058","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4141009","articleId":"4161077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161078,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur Nieuwoudt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Nieuwoudt","id":"37299372300"},{"name":"Tamer Ragheb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ragheb","id":"37299375200"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0848-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0849-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4161078","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"Given the increasing demand for integrated wireless systems in system-on-chip technology, narrow-band low noise amplifier (LNA) designs must be robust against variations in device parameters and passive component values to improve manufacturing yield for high volume applications.

The model is formulated in the frequency domain and defines an equivalent hypothetical load impedance that explains asymmetries, in magnitude and phase, in two-tone IMD products. To test the model, a commercial amplifier has been widely characterized using an inexpensive measurement setup for the acquisition of magnitude and phase of IMD components in a two-tone test.

All OFDM systems suffer from large peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR), which can lead to power inefficiency and nonlinear distortion at the RF portion of the transmitter. Tone reservation method uses reserved tones to generate a peak-canceling signal to lower the PAR of a transmit OFDM block. This paper investigates the recently proposed active-set tone reservation method, for complex-baseband signals, to reduce the PAR in wireless and broadcast systems. When PAR reduction is applied on an OFDM symbol and its PAR level still exceeds the target PAR after reduction this OFDM symbol suffers clipping. In frequency domain clipping energy spreads across all tones and acts as error power. Simulations are performed to investigate the error power on data tones after active-set method","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Annual Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161058/4141009/04161124.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Annual Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/WAMICON.2006.351962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WAMICON.2006.351962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4141009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of the Active-set Algorithm for Peak to Average Ratio Reduction in Wireless OFDM Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Wireless communication","Data communication","Fading","OFDM modulation","Nonlinear distortion","Radio frequency","Transmitters","Signal generators","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active-set algorithm","peak to average ratio reduction","wireless OFDM communication systems","high speed data transmission","multipath fading channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation","active-set tone reservation","complex-baseband signals","broadcast systems","frequency domain clipping","error power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of the Active-set Algorithm for Peak to Average Ratio Reduction in Wireless OFDM Communication Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161124/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9508373","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","conferenceDate":"4-5 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of the Active-set Algorithm for Peak to Average Ratio Reduction in Wireless OFDM Communication Systems","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"WAMICON-00-66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062233S","chronDate":"4-5 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161058","isNumber":"4141009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161058","xplore-issue":"4141009","articleId":"4161124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161127,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elnozahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elnozahi","id":"37295501300"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0848-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0849-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4161127","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Radio frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Optical design","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Stimulated emission","System-on-a-chip","Standards development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","integrated circuit design","radiofrequency amplifiers","system-on-chip","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal tapering factor","maximum bandwidth RF cascaded amplifiers","wide-band amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"Designing wide-band amplifiers has become one of the important issues in wireless and optical high performance system-on-chip applications.

There is increasing use of commercial components in space because of its advanced functionality and it is important to recognize that the space radiation environment poses the risk of permanent malfunction due to radiation. Therefore, the integrated circuits used for spacecraft electronics must be resistant to radiation. The amount of threshold voltage shift in MOS devices caused by ionizing radiation is strongly dependant on the bias voltage applied to the gate terminal during radiation. The threshold voltage shift is much less severe under the influence of ionizing radiation if the gate voltage is 0 V with respect to the device substrate. We have direct control of the bias voltage applied to the gate terminal, and therefore can control the rate of threshold voltage shift in the MOS device. Digital electronic circuits can be hardened against TID effects by selectively applying modular redundancy. By applying double modular redundancy, hence, activating one module while the other is inactivated, allows the inactive modules to anneal during its \"off cycle. It is shown by means of experimentation that this new design technique provides greatly improved TID tolerance for field programmable gate arrays by means of reconfigurable computing.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352753","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161307.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable FPGA Computing to Mitigate for Total Ionizing Dose Effects","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737072","htmlLink":"/document/4161307/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable FPGA Computing to Mitigate for Total Ionizing Dose Effects","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064934S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4161352,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn D.

Peak sidelobe levels may be reduced via amplitude control or weighting across the array aperture. Several authors have made significant contributions in detailing processes for synthesizing these aperture amplitude distributions for the purpose of sidelobe level control. One of the basic trade-offs when implementing amplitude weighting functions is that a trade between low sidelobe levels and a loss in main beam directivity always results. Some of the commercially available pattern calculation programs that can implement sidelobe level control do not provide calculations of the aperture efficiencies given different amplitude weightings. Calculation of the aperture efficiency can be somewhat confusing, particularly with regards to the difference between tapering via attenuation versus redistribution. The purpose of this paper is to define these terms, to provide a review of the proper normalization technique that is important in obtaining accurate aperture efficiency estimation. Descriptions of the amplitude tapers and their utility will be presented. A design example will be presented which will compare theoretical efficiencies with those obtained via finite element method simulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352856","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161352.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aperture Efficiency of Amplitude Weighting Distributions for Array Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Aperture Efficiency of Amplitude Weighting Distributions for Array Antennas","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161352/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737117","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161352/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aperture Efficiency of Amplitude Weighting Distributions for Array Antennas","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082073S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4161360,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

From September 2005 through January 2006, the Ka-band signal from the spacecraft was tracked several times by NASA's deep space network (DSN). During these tracks a number of Ka-band functions for both the spacecraft and the ground systems were tested. These tests were performed to assess the readiness of the ground system and spacecraft to support Ka-band demonstration activities during MRO's primary science phase (PSP). As a result of these tests a number of important lessons were learned regarding the performance of the Ka-band link and the performance of the ground equipment. This paper presents the performance of the ground antenna pointing, delta differential one-way ranging (DeltaDOR) performance and the telemetry performance of the Ka-band link. These results indicate that the extra effort for pointing calibration of the ground antennas at Ka-band is extremely useful; Ka-band shows potential for improved DeltaDOR performance and the models for Ka-band performance of the ground station microwave noise temperature are very accurate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161372/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737137","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MRO Ka-band Demonstration: Cruise Phase Lessons Learned","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRO Ka-band Demonstration: Cruise Phase Lessons Learned","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056394S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4161389,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Javed Hashmi","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4161231/4144550/4161389/4161389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Javed Hashmi received his B.E. in avionics engineering from National University of Sciences and Technology in 1996.

However, not only are large telescopes very costly but, it is also very difficult to attain near diffraction limited performance with large apertures. An array of relatively smaller sized telescopes combined to form a larger synthesized aperture is a viable and efficient alternative to a large monolithic telescope. However, the performance of telescope arrays needs to be investigated under certain limiting factors such as turbulence, tracking errors etc. In this paper, we analyze the impact of tracking errors on the performance of telescope arrays. A deep space optical communication link between Mars and a telescope array receiver on earth is simulated. A closed loop tracking system is employed at the receiver end to cater for the random tracking errors. Monte Carlo Simulation results show that, under tracking errors the performance of telescope arrays can reach very close to that of a large monolithic telescope with the same total photon collecting area. Hence, telescope arrays are a cost-effective alternative for deep space optical communication.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352930","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161389.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Tracking Errors on Performance of Telescope Arrays Receiver for Deep Space Optical Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161389/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Tracking Errors on Performance of Telescope Arrays Receiver for Deep Space Optical Communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737154","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161389/","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Tracking Errors on Performance of Telescope Arrays Receiver for Deep Space Optical Communication","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065775S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161397,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro D'Orazio","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology (DIT), University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4161231/4144550/4161397/4161397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leandro D'Orazio was born in Trento in 1980.

Typically, these systems use both spread spectrum (SS) and forward error correction (FEC) to achieve an acceptable bit error rate (BER). Walsh spreading, based on the Hadamard matrix, is one type of spreading used in CDMA schemes. In particular Walsh spreading is used in both IS-95 and UMTS (3G WCDMA) cellular telephone standards. Walsh-encoded symbols can also be considered an orthogonal modulation alphabet. This paper presents the BER performance of an end-to-end transceiver in the presence of nonlinear amplification with both Walsh modulation and turbo coding. Nonlinear amplification is due to the high-power amplifiers in the cellular base station or satellite downlink. In order to achieve very low BER with reasonable delay, an end-to-end transceiver is implemented in real-time hardware on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The high throughput afforded by the hardware implementation allows us to characterize the large system trade space defined by the Walsh order, amplifier back-off, and signal-to-noise ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161404/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737169","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Nonlinear Amplification on Walsh Encoding/Spreading with Turbo Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Nonlinear Amplification on Walsh Encoding/Spreading with Turbo Coding","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035194S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4161405,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Grayver","affiliation":["Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4161231/4144550/4161405/4161405-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eugene Grayver received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Caltech, and a Ph.D. degree from UCLA.

The AGC scales the received signal such that the constellation points line up with the nominal mapping. The scaling is adjusted to minimize the average distance between the received constellation point and its hard-decision equivalent. This approach has been shown to be optimal for undistorted constellations. However, it is not optimal for constellations distorted by a nonlinear amplifier. This paper investigates the relationship between AGC scaling and nonlinear distortion for coded and uncoded communications links. We present both simulation and experimental results that demonstrate significant improvement in the bit error rate (BER) by changing the AGC adaptation algorithm. The decision directed AGC algorithm is augmented with a least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm to compensate for the nonlinear distortion.

To this end, equations for the transfer functions of SCs with finite gain and input resistance of the opamps are derived. It is shown that these factors have minimal impact on the amplitude-frequency responses (AFRs) of the SCs within their passbands.

Among parameters that characterize the receiver dynamic range, single-tone dynamic range and two-tone dynamic range are usually most important. The ultimate value of the dynamic range upper bound is limited by acceptable power consumption of the receiver AMP. Since expanding the dynamic range usually significantly increases the receiver power consumption, ability to calculate the minimum required dynamic range is very important. An approach to a closed-form solution of the problem is discussed in this paper. Another problem discussed in the paper is achieving the maximum potential dynamic range of a digital receiver. This requires combined use of both well-known and novel methods of dynamic range improvement. The methods include proper selection of the receiver sampling frequency, filtering and utilization of the signal energy during sampling, reduction of the quantization step and increase in the effective number of bits in the receiver A/D, rejection of the strongest interfering signal as close as possible to the antenna, etc.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352968","startPage":"1","endPage":"17","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161408.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Dynamic Range of Digital Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Dynamic Range of Digital Receivers","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161408/","accessionNumber":"9737173","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161408/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Dynamic Range of Digital Receivers","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09011S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4161409,"authors":[{"name":"Yefim S.

These techniques provide high overall energy efficiency of burst transmissions widely used in communication systems with frequency hopping, time division multiple access (TDMA), transmission of short messages, etc. The techniques can also be useful for other types of data transmission. High overall energy efficiency has been achieved as a combined result of several factors: fast synchronization, high noise immunity of a modulation/demodulation, efficient utilization of transmitter power, high tolerance to drifts of the transmitter and/or receiver frequency references and Doppler, and simplicity of signal processing. The modulation technique has been obtained by developing differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) and named alternating quadratures DBPSK (AQ-DBPSK). The spreading technique has been obtained by developing binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and named alternating quadratures BPSK (AQ-BPSK). AQ-DBPSK modulation retains all advantages of DBPSK modulation. Simultaneously, it better utilizes transmitter power and has much higher tolerance to frequency offset between the received and reference signals. AQ-BPSK spreading retains all advantages of BPSK spreading and provides better utilization of transmitter power as well as some other advantages. Initial analysis of these techniques is performed, and recommendations for their implementation are suggested.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352969","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161409.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation and Spreading Techniques for Burst Transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modulation and Spreading Techniques for Burst Transmissions","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161409/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737174","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161409/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation and Spreading Techniques for Burst Transmissions","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068045S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4161430,"authors":[{"name":"Tien-Hsin Chao","affiliation":["Oak Grove Dr. Pasadena, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4161231/4144550/4161430/4161430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tien-Hsin chao received his Ph.D. from the Pennsylvania State University in Electrical Engineering in 1983.

On the other hand, if the measurements have relatively equal amplitudes, then assignment decisions are based on kinematics. Aside from those differences, prior work indicates that the PDAF with amplitude information operates the same as the standard PDAF. However, the literature understates the impact of the amplitude information on the PDAF. This paper analytically derives the decision regions (e.g., the regions for which the strongest measurement receives a larger association probability) for measurement-to-track association using a PDAF with amplitude information. The ratio of association probabilities corresponding to two measurements is also considered. The analysis shows that the PDAF with amplitude information often gives the strongest target an association probability approaching one. Thus, including an amplitude term frequently reduces the PDAF to a strongest neighbor filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161450/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737215","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Data Association with Amplitude Information versus the Strongest Neighbor Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Data Association with Amplitude Information versus the Strongest Neighbor Filter","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041889S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4161455,"authors":[{"name":"Volkan Cevher","affiliation":["Center for Automation Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4161231/4144550/4161455/4161455-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Volkan Cevher was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1978.

The system consists of three blocks: beamformer, random sampling, and particle filter. The beamformer block processes the received acoustic data to output bearing batches as point statistics. The random sampling block determines temporal clustering of the bearings in a batch to determine region-of-interests (ROIs). Based on the track-before-detect approach, each ROI indicates the presence of a possible target. We describe three random sampling algorithms called RANSAC, MSAC, and NAPSAC to use in the random sampling block. The particle filter then tracks the targets via its interactions with the beamformer and the random sampling blocks. We present a computational analysis of the random sampling blocks and show tracking results with field data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Sampling methods","Particle filters","Particle tracking","Direction of arrival estimation","State-space methods","Clustering algorithms","Sensor arrays","Robustness","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","sampling methods","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitarget bearing tracking system","random sampling consensus","acoustic direction-of-arrival tracking system","multiple maneuvering target tracking","random sampling","particle filter","beamformer block processes","point statistics","temporal clustering","region-of-interests","track-before-detect approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.353045","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.353045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi Target Bearing Tracking System using Random Sampling Consensus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Multi Target Bearing Tracking System using Random Sampling Consensus","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161455/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161455/","accessionNumber":"9737220","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi Target Bearing Tracking System using Random Sampling Consensus","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087765S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4161471,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This concept differs substantially from current SARs in which closely spaced antenna arrays are used. With closely spaced antenna elements, it is possible to coherent a beam toward a direction in space and to realize a coherent processing gain. However, these systems are prone to severe target fading, and hence they may suffer considerable performance degradation. The fundamental difference between MIMO SAR and other SAR is that the latter seek to maximize the coherent processing gain, while MIMO SAR capitalizes on the diversity of target scattering to improve radar performance. The superiority of MIMO SAR in many aspects over the conventional SAR, e.g., high resolution, good sensitivity, and countermining target fluctuations is investigated. It is shown that, the use of MIMO SAR leads to solutions that previously thought to be out of reach for remote sensing scientists and customers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161485.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.353075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.353075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of MIMO Technique for Aerospace Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Remote sensing","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar remote sensing","Radar scattering","Radar antennas","Antenna arrays","Directive antennas","Fading","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO systems","radar tracking","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO technique","aerospace remote sensing","multiple-input multiple-output radar","MIMO synthetic aperture radar","closely spaced antenna arrays","closely spaced antenna elements","coherent processing gain","target fading","MIMO SAR","target scattering diversity","radar performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","remote sensing","aerospace technique","radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Applications of MIMO Technique for Aerospace Remote Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737250","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of MIMO Technique for Aerospace Remote Sensing","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088991S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161508,"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Rockett","affiliation":["BAE SYSTEMS, Manassas, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4161231/4144550/4161508/4161508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leonard Rockett is the manager of the microelectronics business area at BAE Systems in Manassas VA.

Based on a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) cell, these devices will be integrated into a radiation-hard SOI CMOS process, to replace conventional flip flops and small on-chip memories. These nonvolatile memory cells will form an integral part of on-chip power management. Memory density is the primary driver for commercial MRAMs, which are designed using an X-Y addressing scheme. Current pulses on two orthogonal wires generate a magnetic field, which is strong enough to reprogram a cell at the intersection between the two wires, and nowhere else. This requires that the cells be very uniform in their sensitivity, and optimized for magnetic \"selectivity,\" so that only the desired cells are programmed. Designed as replacements for flip-flops and latches, the Embedded Magnetic Memory uses a pair of MTJ cells in a differential scheme. The differential arrangement mitigates concerns of process variation, but introduces a new set of challenges. Each cell will be programmed by a single current pulse. The challenge is to design the cells and the programming structures to make efficient use of the magnetic field, and minimize programming current.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.353103","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161513.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.353103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Magnetic Memory for Embedded Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Magnetic Memory for Embedded Computing Systems","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161513/","accessionNumber":"9737277","publicationDate":"March 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Magnetic Memory for Embedded Computing Systems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099386S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4161514,"authors":[{"name":"R.F.

This approach is problematic due to the precise placement and registration required thus making large scale manufacturing difficult if not impossible. A novel technique has been developed to overcome this hurdle, allowing CNT based nano-devices to be fabricated directly on existing production CMOS fabrication lines. This technique has been demonstrated in a Class 1 commercial fab and enables the fabrication of CNT nonvolatile memory devices directly onto CMOS substrates. This unique approach relies on the deposition and lithographic patterning, using standard semiconductor toolsets, of a 1-2 nm thick fabric of carbon nanotubes which retain their molecular scale, electro-mechanical characteristics, even when patterned to less than 100 nm feature sizes. The non-volatile CNT switch is turned on using electrostatic forces and remains in the ON state through van der Waals (VDW) attraction. The switch is turned off by overcoming the VDW forces and creating separation of the tubes from a contact.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.353104","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161514.pdf","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.353104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161514/","displayDocTitle":"Carbon Nanotube Based Memory Development and Testing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161514/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9737278","publicationDate":"March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carbon Nanotube Based Memory Development and Testing","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05237S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161518,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

In addressing these demands, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems can serve a vital role in achieving performance requirements. However, these technologies are susceptible to radiation effects in the harsh environment of space. In order to effectively exploit high-performance COTS systems in future spacecraft, proper care must be taken with hardware and software architectures and algorithms that avoid or overcome the data errors that can lead to erroneous results. One of the more common kernels in space-based applications is the 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT). Many papers have investigated fault-tolerant FFT, but no algorithm has been devised that would allow for error correction without re-computation from original data. In this paper, we present a new method of applying algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) concepts to the 2D-FFT that will not only allow for error detection but also error correction within memory-constrained systems as well as ensure coherence of the data after the computation. To further improve reliability of this ABFT approach, we propose use of a checksum encoding scheme that addresses issues related to numerical precision and overflow. The performance of the fault-tolerant 2D-FFT will be presented and featured as part of a dependable range Doppler processor, which is a subcomponent of synthetic-aperture radar algorithms.

However, visually tracking targets can be challenging because of the inherent clutter and occlusions. To add to this challenge, adversarial targets will attempt to escape. To counter these challenges a two tiered approach is used. In the first tier, a particle filter is used to estimate the location of the target using information from the incoming video stream. The particle filter is a sample-based tool for approximating the solution to the optimal, Bayesian tracking problem. The filter is adept at approximating non-Gaussian distributions that evolve according to non-linear dynamics. However, this increased functionality comes with an inherently large computational burden. A methodology for allowing the filter to manage the computational load of the filter based on the tracking conditions is presented along with simulation and flight test results. In the second tier, an adversarial reasoning module is used to produce strategies for a team of UAVs that is tracking an evading target. By using a differential game framework a team of air vehicles is able to contain a target that is attempting to escape. The framework decomposes a complete game into a set of two player games, which are solved more easily. The framework is presented along with simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target Tracking and Adversarial Reasoning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352756","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161586.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Target Tracking and Adversarial Reasoning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161586/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737350","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Tracking and Adversarial Reasoning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097944S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4161590,"authors":[{"name":"M.

One of the key functions of the system is to extract semantic information. Before we can determine the meaning of text, we must identify its language. In a previous project, we have implemented an N-gram based language identifier that can process up to 1 Gbps throughput. However, a large percentage of computer network traffic, such as email and Web data, consists of markup information such as tags and protocol specific options. This additional data interferes with the language identification process causing decreased accuracy. Thus, we developed a hardware architecture for configurable application level processing. Our Application Level Processing System (ALPS) is a custom processor that is automatically generated using syntactic structure of the content. The resulting circuit is mapped on to a reconfigurable device to efficiently extract only the relevant data for the language identifier. To illustrate the effectiveness of the architecture, we have implemented a system that can process electronic mail. Our experiments show that ALPS can improve the accuracy of the hardware language identifier by up to a factor of 200 as compared to a system that does not decode the application-level protocol data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737370","htmlLink":"/document/4161606/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Accelerated Parser for Extraction of Metadata in Semantic Network Content","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Accelerated Parser for Extraction of Metadata in Semantic Network Content","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086963S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4161628,"authors":[{"name":"Edward R.

The current on-board diagnosis systems embedded in the automobiles follow conventional rule-based diagnosis procedures, and may benefit from the introduction of sophisticated artificial intelligence and pattern recognition-based procedures in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Here, we present a mode-invariant fault diagnosis procedure that is based on data -driven approach, and show its applicability to automotive engines. The proposed approach achieves high-diagnostic accuracy by detecting the faults as soon as they occur. It uses statistical hypothesis tests to detect faults, a wavelet-based preprocessing of the data, and pattern recognition techniques for classifying various faults in engines. We simulate the Toyota Camry 544N Engine SIMULINK model in a real-time simulator and controlled by a prototype ECU (Electronic Control Unit). The engine model is simulated under several operating conditions (pedal angle, engine speed, etc), and pre-and post-fault data is collected for eight engine faults with different severity levels, and a database of cases is created for applying the presented approach. The results demonstrate that appealing diagnostic accuracy and fault severity estimation are possible with pattern recognition-based techniques, and, in particular, with the support vector machines.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352874","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161651.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an Effective Data-Driven Approach to Real-time time Fault Diagnosis in Automotive Engines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of an Effective Data-Driven Approach to Real-time time Fault Diagnosis in Automotive Engines","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161651/","accessionNumber":"9737415","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161651/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an Effective Data-Driven Approach to Real-time time Fault Diagnosis in Automotive Engines","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097497S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4161687,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney A.

Most of the algorithms are based upon variants of the well-known unconditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM). One goal of the paper is to demonstrate the maximum utility of these algorithms by the exhaustive development of a very simple GMM. Selected variants will provide us with the added benefit of diagnostic capability. Another algorithm that shares a common technique for detection with the GMM is presented, but instead uses a different modeling paradigm. The model provides a more rich description of the dynamics of the data, however the data requirements are quite modest. We will show that this very simple and straightforward method finds an event that characterizes a departure from nominal operation. We show that further diagnostic investigation with the GMM-based method can be used as a means to gain insight into operational idiosyncrasies for this nominally categorized test. Therefore, by using both modeling paradigms we can corroborate planned operational commands or provide warnings for unexpected operational commands.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2007.352949","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161231/4144550/04161687.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2007.352949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4144550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis for Liquid Rocket Engine Propulsion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-10 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161687/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis for Liquid Rocket Engine Propulsion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9737450","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161687/","conferenceDate":"3-10 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis for Liquid Rocket Engine Propulsion","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"AERO-00-456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068929S","chronDate":"3-10 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4161231","isNumber":"4144550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161231","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4144550","articleId":"4161687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161748,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Rao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Rao","id":"37302357500"},{"name":"Alfred O.

Few results, however, have been provided by Terahertz spectroscopy which reveals the absorbtion or reflectance percentage from different DNA sequences. Previous Terahertz methods have lacked a quantitative analysis of the spectroscopy features, and no definitive conclusion regarding the data can be easily drawn. In this paper, we use a signal processing approach which gives a quantitative interpretation of the DNA spectroscopy. Due to the presence of physical noise, the data can be contaminated by both random fluctuations and impulsive noise. A new signal processing tool called empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is employed to remove the noise and extract the trend of the signal. The data is subsequently partitioned by clustering methods. Experimental results of Terahertz spectroscopy of several different DNA samples show that the EMD aids the clustering process and yields clustering of higher validity than that obtained from the raw data.","doi":"10.1109/GENSIPS.2006.353157","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161740/4161741/04161778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GENSIPS.2006.353157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4161741","startPage":"63","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical mode decomposition as a tool for DNA sequence analysis from terahertz spectroscopy measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Empirical mode decomposition as a tool for DNA sequence analysis from terahertz spectroscopy measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161778/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"10284641","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4161778/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical mode decomposition as a tool for DNA sequence analysis from terahertz spectroscopy measurements","confLoc":"College Station, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0000063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052613S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161740","isNumber":"4161741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161740","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4161741","articleId":"4161778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4161781,"authors":[{"name":"Gergely Korodi","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Gergely","lastName":"Korodi","id":"37297781000"},{"name":"Ioan Tabus","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Tabus","id":"37267482300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0384-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0385-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3001"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-301X"}],"articleNumber":"4161781","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Sequences","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Indexing","Training data","Biomedical signal processing","Information retrieval","Biological information theory","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data compression","DNA","encoding","file organisation","random processes","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access DNA sequence compression","encoder","functional element"]}],"abstract":"This article investigates the efficiency of randomly accessible coding for annotated genome files and compares it to universal coding.

In order to combine the sphere decoders with the outer channel code decoder, researchers have proposed to include a candidate list in the sphere decoder to provide soft information to the channel code decoder. This algorithm is called list sphere decoder (LSD). In the LSD, different from the conventional sphere decoder (CSD), the candidate list introduces significant hardware overhead. In this paper, we propose to use a tree-type comparator array, a link table and sublists to reduce the hardware complexity of inserting new candidates into the list.

In our ML approach, the channel and data are treated as random variables, unlike existing ML approaches in which the channel and data are treated as unknown constants. This in turn enables us to incorporate the spatial correlation and transmit data correlation into the analysis. In particular, we derive closed-form cost functions which can be used to accurately estimate the CFO. We also derive the Cram r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for these estimators.

The lengths of FFT/IFFT operations may vary in different applications of OFDM systems. Moreover, due to the trend of system-on-chip (SOC), rapid prototyping and intelligent soft IP designs are important design methodologies. In this paper, we design and implement a variable-length FFT processor to cover different applications of OFDM systems. We propose an efficient design flow which makes re-designing an FFT processor rapid and easy. We adopt cached-memory structure in the FFT processor for low-power consumption issue. Besides, we employ block-floating-point (BFP) arithmetic to acquire high signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR). Finally, we implement this processor with TSMCO. 18 mum 1P6M CMOS technology. The simulation results show that the chip can perform 64~2048-point FFT operations at 75 MHz which meet the speed requirements of most OFDM standards such as WLAN, ADSL, VDSL (256~2048), DAB, and DVB (2k mode)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161805/4141012/04161826.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2006.352556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2006.352556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4141012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid IP Design of Variable-length Cached-FFT Processor for OFDM-based Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Fast Fourier transforms","Demodulation","OFDM modulation","Kernel","System-on-a-chip","Prototypes","Design methodology","Arithmetic","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP design","variable-length cached-FFT processor","OFDM-based communication system","fast Fourier transform","18 micron","75 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Rapid IP Design of Variable-length Cached-FFT Processor for OFDM-based Communication Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9398952","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid IP Design of Variable-length Cached-FFT Processor for OFDM-based Communication Systems","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"SIPS-00-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066567S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161805","isNumber":"4141012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161805","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4141012","articleId":"4161826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161830,"authors":[{"name":"Yuming Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37280223100"},{"name":"Yanni Chen","affiliation":["DSP Solutions R&D Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yanni","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281032800"},{"name":"Dale Hocevar","affiliation":["DSP Solutions R&D Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Dale","lastName":"Hocevar","id":"37271300300"},{"name":"Manish Goel","affiliation":["DSP Solutions R&D Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Goel","id":"37300515000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0382-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0383-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4161830","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Hardware","Code standards","Instruments","Digital video broadcasting","Switches","Application specific integrated circuits","Frequency synthesizers","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","IEEE standards","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check","LDPC decoder","IEEE 802.16e standard","ASIC process technology","decoding iterations","100 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a reduced-complexity, scalable implementation of LDPC decoder is presented.

In this paper, we propose a new early termination (ET) scheme based on the decoding threshold. Moreover, we proposed the cross-correlation measurement to predict the decoding threshold. The iterative decoding can stop in either high-SNR situation where the decoded bits are highly reliable (solvable decoding), or in low-SNR situation where the decoder already has no capability to decode (unsolvable decoding). At the same time, the receiver can send an automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) message to the transmitter in noise-seriously-coupling situation. Through simulations, the reduced iterations due to the ET scheme almost will not affect the SNR performance. Based on our analysis and simulation results, we can further modify the conventional GENIE chart.

Based on the fact that the integrity of different bits in the trellis state metric has (largely) different effect on the overall trellis decoding performance, we proposed an importance-aware clock skew scheduling technique that assigns those more important bits with longer timing slacks and hence better immunity to VOS-induced errors. This will provide system-level tolerance to VOS-induced errors in trellis decoders. With Viterbi and Max-Log-MAP decoders as test vehicles, we demonstrated that about 30% energy savings on trellis state metric computation can be realized with negligible decoding performance degradation","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2006.352582","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161805/4141012/04161852.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4141012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2006.352582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power Trellis Decoder with Overscaled Supply Voltage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low Power Trellis Decoder with Overscaled Supply Voltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161852/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9409269","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Trellis Decoder with Overscaled Supply Voltage","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"SIPS-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061178S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161805","isNumber":"4141012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161805","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4141012","articleId":"4161852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4161855,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Philadelphia, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292712200"},{"name":"Yongmei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Philadelphia, USA"],"firstName":"Yongmei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37278734300"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Philadelphia, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274912700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0382-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0383-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4161855","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161855","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Throughput","Iterative decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Iterative algorithms","Hardware","Quantization","Computer architecture","Parallel architectures","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures","parity check codes","product codes","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal overlapped sum-product decoder","OSP","low density parity check codes","quasicyclic LDPC codes","partly parallel architecture","quantization scheme","field programmable gate array","FPGA","61 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","quasicyclic (QC) codes","turbo decoding","sum-product decoding","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose partly parallel architectures based on optimal overlapped sum-product (OSP) decoding.

In this paper, the performance of various LDPC codes, including recent candidate LDPC codes for 10GBASE-T Ethernet, in the presence of colored noise is evaluated and compared with the effects of conventional additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The colored noise models in this study include high-frequency and low-frequency additive colored Gaussian noise (ACGN), and 1/f noise. The results show that LDPC codes are more vulnerable to colored noise than to AWGN and as the correlation between noise samples becomes stronger, their performance becomes more degraded.

The finite precision implementations for SPA have an important tradeoff between the decoding performance and hardware complexity caused by two dominant area consuming factors. One is the memory for updated messages storage and the other is the look-up table (LUT) for implementation of nonlinear function Psi(x). The proposed two types of variable quantization schemes result in significant reductions of LUT sizes. Computer simulation results indicate that the performance losses of SPA with reduced LUT by proposed schemes are less than 0.05 dB compared to that of SPA with original LUT. Moreover, the proposed implementation offers a large reduction in the finite wordlength for storage of updated messages using a kind of compression technique without performance losses. As a result, using the proposed implementation based on variable quantization scheme and data compression technique, the novel proposed implementation for SPA decoder architecture offers significant reductions of 75% and 33% in hardware complexities of LUT and memories, respectively, without significant performance degradations over conventional uniform quantization scheme. Furthermore, since each LUT with variable (6:3) quantization scheme II has only 8 entries, its hardware implementation can be replaced with a small combination circuit instead of readonly-memory (ROM) for LUT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161862/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9409274","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4161862/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Implementations of Sum-Product Algorithm for Decoding Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Implementations of Sum-Product Algorithm for Decoding Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"SIPS-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066236S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161805","isNumber":"4141012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161805","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4141012","articleId":"4161862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4161863,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Qiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Laboratory of Image and Vision Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Qiang","id":"37288261100"},{"name":"Nigel M Allinson","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Laboratory of Image and Vision Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Nigel M","lastName":"Allinson","id":"37278467000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0382-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0383-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"4161863","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":199},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Optical Distortion Correction in an FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161805/4141012/04161863.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2006.352593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4141012","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2006.352593","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical distortion","Field programmable gate arrays","Image processing","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical imaging","Hardware","Lenses","Cameras","Parallel architectures","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","image processing","optical distortion","optical images","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial optical distortion correction","image processing algorithms","optical images","pipelined parallel architecture","hardware description language","VHDL","field programmable gate array","Xilinx FPGA XCS31000-4 device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4161863","abstract":"Due to the complexities of the image processing algorithms, correcting spatial distortion of optical images quickly and efficiently is a major challenge.

The GSFAP algorithm, discussed in the paper, is characterized by convergence superior to the popular NLMS, with only slightly higher complexity. The paper deals with floating-point-like implementation of algorithm using FPGA hardware. We present an optimized core for the GSFAP, built using logarithmic arithmetic which provides very low cost multiplication and division. The design is crafted to make efficient use of the pipelined logarithmic addition units. The resulting GSFAP core can be clocked at more than 80 MHz on the one million gate Xilinx XC2VI000-4 device. It can be used to implement filters of orders 20 to 1000 with a sampling rate exceeding 50 kHz. For comparison, we implemented a similar NLMS core and found that although it is slightly smaller than the GSFAP core and it allows a higher signal sampling rate (around 70 kHz) for the corresponding filter orders, GSFAP has adaptation properties that are much superior to NLMS, and that our core can provide very sophisticated adaptive filtering capabilities for resource-constrained embedded systems","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2006.352602","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4161805/4141012/04161872.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4141012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2006.352602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Adaptive Filters based on GSFAP using Log Arithmetic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Adaptive Filters based on GSFAP using Log Arithmetic","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4161872/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9398982","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Adaptive Filters based on GSFAP using Log Arithmetic","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"SIPS-00-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109179S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4161805","isNumber":"4141012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4161805","xplore-issue":"4141012","articleId":"4161872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4161875,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Michard","affiliation":["Ar\u00e9naire project, LIP (CNRS-ENSL-INRIA-UCBL), Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Michard","id":"38273588700"},{"name":"Arnaud Tisserand","affiliation":["Arith group, LIRMM (CNRS-Univ.

From a system perspective, one has to focus on performance versus power consumption tradeoff. In this paper, we derive SmartMIMO: an adaptive energy-aware link adaptation approach which, next to the modulation and code rate, decides on using either space-division multiplexing (increasing spectrum efficiency) or space-time coding (increasing robustness) to transmit a given packet on a given MIMO channel.

Cooperative diversity or virtual antenna arrays facilitate spatio-temporal communications without actually requiring the deployment of physical antenna arrays. Virtual MISO entails the simultaneous transmission of appropriately encoded information by multiple nodes to effectively emulate a transmission on an antenna array. We present a novel multilayer approach for exploiting virtual MISO links in ad hoc networks. The approach spans the physical, medium access control and routing layers, and provides 1) a significant improvement in the end-to-end performance in terms of throughput and delay and 2) robustness to mobility and interference-induced link failures. The key physical layer property that we exploit is an increased transmission range due to achieved diversity gain. Except for space-time signal processing capabilities, our design does not require any additional hardware. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the benefits of our approach using virtual MISO links. As compared to using only SISO links, we achieve an increase of up to 150 percent in terms of the end-to-end throughput and a decrease of up to 75 percent in the incurred end-to-end delay. Our results also demonstrate a reduction in the route discovery attempts due to link failures by up to 60 percent, a direct consequence of the robustness that our approach provides to link failures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4161908/04161912.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"594","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.1068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.1068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4161908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Framework for Exploiting Virtual MISO Links in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Framework for Exploiting Virtual MISO Links in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","htmlLink":"/document/4161912/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9460614","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Framework for Exploiting Virtual MISO Links in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"h0579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083063S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4161908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4161908","articleId":"4161912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4161915,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Rong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4161908/4161915/4161915-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Rong received the BS degree from Shandong University in 1993, the MS degree from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1997, and the PhD degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2001.

Among the well-established location determination approaches, probabilistic techniques show good performance and, thus, become increasingly popular. For these techniques to achieve a high level of accuracy, however, a large number of training samples are usually required for calibration, which incurs a great amount of offline manual effort. In this paper, we aim to solve the problem by reducing both the sampling time and the number of locations sampled in constructing a radio map. We propose a novel learning algorithm that builds location-estimation systems based on a small fraction of the calibration data that traditional techniques require and a collection of user traces that can be cheaply obtained. When the number of sampled locations is reduced, an interpolation method is developed to effectively patch a radio map. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods are effective in reducing the calibration effort. In particular, unlabeled user traces can be used to compensate for the effects of reducing the calibration effort and can even improve the system performance. Consequently, manual effort can be reduced substantially while a high level of accuracy is still achieved","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4161908/04161917.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"662","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.1025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.1025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4161908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Calibration Effort for Probabilistic Indoor Location Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4161917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Calibration Effort for Probabilistic Indoor Location Estimation","htmlLink":"/document/4161917/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9460619","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Calibration Effort for Probabilistic Indoor Location Estimation","sourcePdf":"h0649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066522S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4161908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4161908","articleId":"4161917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4161920,"authors":[{"name":"Azadeh Kushki","affiliation":["Edward S.

First, we show that, due to the variability of RSS features over space, a spatially localized positioning method leads to improved positioning results. Second, we explore the problem of access point (AP) selection for positioning and demonstrate the need for further research in this area. Third, we present a kernelized distance calculation algorithm for comparing RSS observations to RSS training records.

However, the top concern is robustness of wireless communications. Wireless control loops must be maintained under persistent adverse channel conditions, such as noise, large-scale path loss, fading, and many electromagnetic interference sources in industrial environments. The conventional IEEE 802.11 WLANs, originally designed for high bandwidth instead of high robustness, are therefore inappropriate for IC-WLAN. A solution lies in the direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology: by deploying the largest possible processing gain (slowest bit rate) that fully exploits the low data rate feature of industrial control, much higher robustness can be achieved. We hereby propose using DSSS-CDMA to build IC-WLAN. We carry out fine-grained physical layer simulations and Monte Carlo comparisons. The results show that DSSS-CDMA IC-WLAN provides much higher robustness than IEEE 802.11/802.15.4 WLAN, so that reliable wireless industrial control loops become feasible. We also show that deploying larger processing gain is preferable, to deploying more intensive convolutional coding.

The parallel HEV control problem involves the determination of the time profiles of the power flows from the engine and the electric motor. This is also referred to as the power split between the conventional and the electric sources. The objective of HEV control is in fact to find out the sequence of optimal power splits at each instant of time that minimizes the fuel consumption over a given driving schedule. Big obstacles to the control design are the model complexity and the necessity of \"a priori\" knowledge of torque and velocity profiles. This paper presents three different energy management approaches for the control of a parallel hybrid electric sport-utility-vehicle that do not require a priori knowledge of the driving cycle. The considered approaches are: a rule-based control, an adaptive equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), and the H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n control.

Recently, variable-frequency (and variable-voltage) parallel and serial links have also been proposed, which can save link power consumption by exploiting variations in the bandwidth requirement. This provides a new dimension for power optimization in a distributed embedded system connected by a voltage-scalable interconnection network. At the same time, it imposes new challenges for variable-voltage scheduling as well as flow control. First, the variable-voltage scheduling algorithm should be able to trade off the power consumption and delay jointly for both processors and links. Second, for the variable-frequency network, the scheduling algorithm should not only consider the real-time constraints, but should also be consistent with the underlying flow control techniques. In this paper, we address joint dynamic voltage scaling for variable-voltage processors and communication links in such systems. We propose a scheduling algorithm for real-time applications that captures both data flow and control flow information. It performs efficient routing of communication events through multihops, as well as efficient slack allocation among heterogeneous processors and communication links to maximize energy savings, while meeting all real-time constraints. Our experimental study shows that on an average, joint voltage scaling on processors and links can achieve 32% less power compared with voltage scaling on processors alone","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.893660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4162500","startPage":"427","endPage":"437","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4162500/04162511.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.893660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Dynamic Voltage Scaling of Processors and Communication Links in Real-Time Distributed Embedded Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic voltage scaling","Real time systems","Embedded system","Energy consumption","Scheduling algorithm","Delay","Communication system control","Bandwidth","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","microprocessor chips","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication links","distributed embedded systems","voltage-scalable interconnection network","variable voltage scheduling","dynamic voltage scaling","power optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed systems","low power","scheduling","voltage-scalable interconnection network","voltage scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Dynamic Voltage Scaling of Processors and Communication Links in Real-Time Distributed Embedded Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4162511/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9439243","publicationDate":"April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Dynamic Voltage Scaling of Processors and Communication Links in Real-Time Distributed Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi04-luo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082749S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4162500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4162500","articleId":"4162511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4162513,"authors":[{"name":"Nachiketh R.

The most successful of these attacks are side-channel attacks which exploit unintended information leakage, e.g., timing information, power consumption, etc., from the implementation to extract the secret key. We propose a novel framework for implementing side-channel attacks where the attack is modeled as a search problem which takes the leaked information as its input, and deduces the secret key by using a satisfiability solver, a powerful Boolean reasoning technique. This approach can substantially enhance the scope of side-channel attacks by allowing a potentially wide range of internal variables to be exploited (not just those that are trivially related to the key). The proposed technique is particularly suited for attacking cryptographic software implementations which may inadvertently expose the values of intermediate variables in their computations (even though, they are very careful in protecting secret keys through the use of on-chip key generation and storage). We demonstrate our attack on standard software implementations of three popular cryptographic algorithms: DES, 3DES, and AES.

Aggressive transistor scaling, decreased voltage margins and increased processor power and temperature have made reliability assessment a much more significant issue. Although reliability of devices and interconnect has been broadly studied, in this work, we study a tradeoff between reliability and power consumption for component-based SoC designs.

The reuse of previously designed Intellectual Property (IP) modules is a common form of abstraction used to reduce design time. However, different applications typically use a variety of physical interfaces, communication protocols, and global system-level control for IP modules, which complicates design reuse. In this paper, we describe the SIMPPL system model and an abstraction for IP modules, called the computing element (CE), that facilitate the SoC design for both field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platforms. The CE abstraction decouples the datapath and system-level communication from the application-specific control to promote design reuse by localizing control redesign of IP for new applications. The SIMPPL model facilitates multi-clock domain SoC designs and expedites system integration by defining the intermodule links and communication protocols","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4162500/04162515.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.893645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.893645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4162500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4162515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIMPPL: An Adaptable <emphasis emphasistype=\"roman\">SoC</emphasis> Framework Using a Programmable Controller IP Interface to Facilitate Design Reuse","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Control systems","Field programmable gate arrays","System-on-a-chip","Intellectual property","Protocols","Application specific integrated circuits","Hardware","Finite impulse response filter","Software design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","industrial property","integrated circuit design","programmable controllers","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","ASIC","design reuse","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","intellectual property","system integration","system-on-chip design","SIMPPL","intermodule links","communication protocols","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["application-specific architectures","application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)","customizable controllers","design reuse","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","Intellectual Property (IP) reuse","system integration","system-on-chip design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"SIMPPL: An Adaptable <emphasis emphasistype=\"roman\">SoC</emphasis> Framework Using a Programmable Controller IP Interface to Facilitate Design Reuse","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4162515/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9439239","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIMPPL: An Adaptable <emphasis emphasistype=\"roman\">SoC</emphasis> Framework Using a Programmable Controller IP Interface to Facilitate Design Reuse","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi04-shannon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083437S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4162500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4162500","articleId":"4162515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4162516,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279255300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4162516","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Iterative decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Turbo codes","Iterative algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Design optimization","Very large scale integration","Clocks","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed integrated circuits","integrated logic circuits","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","turbo codes","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed recursion architectures","MAP-based turbo decoders","maximum a posterior probability algorithm","error correction codes","VLSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correction codes","high-speed design","maximum a posterior probability (MAP) decoder","Turbo code","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"The maximum a posterior probability (MAP) algorithm has been widely used in Turbo decoding for its outstanding performance.

Thus, the reduction of speckle is critical in various SAR image processing tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new spatially adaptive wavelet-based Bayesian method for despeckling the SAR images. The wavelet coefficients of the logarithmically transformed reflectance and speckle noise are modeled using the zero-location Cauchy and zero-mean Gaussian distributions, respectively. These prior distributions are then exploited to develop a Bayesian minimum mean absolute error estimator as well as a maximum a posteriori estimator. A new context-based technique with a reduced complexity is proposed for incorporating the spatial dependency of the wavelet coefficients with the Bayesian estimation processes. Experiments are carried out using typical noise-free images corrupted with simulated speckle noise as well as real SAR images, and the results show that the proposed method performs favorably in comparison to some of the existing methods in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio, speckle statistics and structural similarity index, and in its ability to suppress the speckle in the homogeneous regions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Wavelet-Based Method Using the Cauchy Prior for Denoising the SAR Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2006.888020","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4162519/04162521.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.888020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4162519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4162521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Wavelet-Based Method Using the Cauchy Prior for Denoising the SAR Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4162521/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9438212","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Adaptive Wavelet-Based Method Using the Cauchy Prior for Denoising the SAR Images","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt04-bhuyian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084304S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4162519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4162519","articleId":"4162521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4162522,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Wei Chang","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4162519/4162522/4162522-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Wei Chang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1980.

For a tile with size 256times256, it costs 175 kB on-chip SRAM for the architectures using on-chip tile memory or costs 310 MB/s SDRAM bandwidth for the architectures using off-chip tile memory. In this design, a level-switched scheduling is developed to eliminate tile memory and the DWT and the EBC are pipelined at pixel-level.

Finally, we use the adaptive overlapped block MC (OBMC), which adjusts the coefficients of overlapped windows based on the reliabilities of neighboring motion vectors.

Recently a multiplication-free 1BT (MF-1BT) has been proposed to facilitate 1BT to be carried out with integer arithmetic using addition and shifts only. Thresholding schemes are typically used in order to construct the lower bit depth representations utilized in 1BT and 2BT. In our experience we have observed that one problem with such schemes is that pixel values that lie on directly opposite sides of the threshold are categorized into separate classes and are, therefore, counted as a nonmatch in the search process even if they are close in value. A constrained 1BT (C-1BT) that restricts pixels with values adjacent to the transform threshold during 1BT matching, counting them as a match regardless of their 1BT value, is proposed in this paper. It is shown that the proposed C-1BT approach improves the ME accuracy of 1BT-based ME and even outperforms 2BT-based ME at macroblock level","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.893828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4162519/04162537.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.893828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4162519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained One-Bit Transform for Low Complexity Block Motion Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4162537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162537/","displayDocTitle":"Constrained One-Bit Transform for Low Complexity Block Motion Estimation","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9438208","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4162537/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained One-Bit Transform for Low Complexity Block Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt04-urhan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054885S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4162519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4162519","articleId":"4162537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4162539,"authors":[{"name":"Yongseok Yi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongseok","lastName":"Yi","id":"38237166800"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4162539","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":548},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Decoding","Pipeline processing","Frequency","Arithmetic","Large-scale systems","Video sequences","Acceleration","Load modeling","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","arithmetic codes","binary codes","decoding","image sequences","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed H.264/AVC CABAC decoding","context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding","large-scale video sequences","parallelism schemes","pipeline schemes","bin-level pipelining","real-time decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive binary arithmetic code","entropy coding","H.264/AVC","syntax processing"]}],"abstract":"The decoding of context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) imposes a heavy performance requirement on H.264/AVC decoding systems particularly for large-scale video sequences. As a simple approach of elevating the operating frequency is not sufficient to meet the performance requirement, this paper proposes an efficient approach to accelerate the decoding, which is effective under relatively low operating frequency. Since the CABAC decoding procedure is highly sequential and has strong data dependencies, it is difficult to exploit parallelism and pipeline schemes. The proposed approach resolves the difficulties by modifying the operation chain based on a thorough analysis, eventually enabling both parallel operations and pipelining. More specifically, 1) several context models are simultaneously loaded from memory while context selection is performed in parallel and 2) bin-level pipelining is enabled by employing a small storage to remove structural hazards and data dependencies.

According to our analysis, an optimal low-power IME engine should be a parallel hardware architecture supporting fast algorithms and efficient data reuse (DR). In this paper, a hardware-oriented fast algorithm is proposed with the intra-/inter-candidate DR considerations. In addition, based on the systolic array and 2-D adder tree architecture, a ladder-shaped search window data arrangement and an advanced searching flow are proposed to efficiently support inter-candidate DR and reduce latency cycles. According to the implementation results, 97% computational complexity is saved by the proposed fast algorithm. In addition, 77.6% memory bandwidth is further saved with the proposed DR techniques at architecture level.

Compared with existing H.264 rate control schemes, our scheme has offered several new features. First, the inter-dependency between rate-distortion optimization (RDO) and rate control in H.264 is resolved via quantization parameter estimation and update. Second, since the bits of the header information may occupy a larger portion of the total bit budget, which is especially true when being coded at low bit rates, a rate model for the header information is developed to estimate header bits more accurately. The number of header bits is modeled as a function of the number of nonzero motion vector (MV) elements and the number of MVs. Third, a new source rate model and a distortion model are proposed. For this purpose, coded 4 times 4 blocks are identified and the number of source bits and distortion are modeled as functions of the quantization stepsize and the complexity of coded 4 times 4 blocks. Finally, a R-D optimized bit allocation scheme among macroblocks (MBs) is proposed to improve picture quality. Built upon the above ideas, a rate control algorithm is developed for the H.264 baseline-profile encoder under the constant bit rate constraint. It is shown by experimental results that the new algorithm can control bit rates accurately with the R-D performance significantly better than that of the rate control algorithm implemented in the H.264 software encoder JM8.1a","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9438214","htmlLink":"/document/4162551/","displayDocTitle":"Rate Control for H.264 Video With Enhanced Rate and Distortion Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Control for H.264 Video With Enhanced Rate and Distortion Models","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt05-kwon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105435S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4162540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"4162540","articleId":"4162551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4162558,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jen Wang","affiliation":["M-Star, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4162540/4162558/4162558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Jen Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2004 and 2006, respectively.","After graduation, he joined M-Star, Inc., Hsinchu.

In the forward sweep, the voltage at each downstream bus is then updated by the real and imaginary components of the calculated bus voltage multiplying with the corresponding ratio. The procedure stops after the mismatch of the calculated and the specified voltages at the substation is less than a convergence tolerance. The proposed algorithm is tested with three IEEE benchmark distribution systems.

In this article a new and very easy method to compute accurate forecasts for electricity prices using mixed models is proposed. The main idea is to develop an efficient tool for one-step-ahead forecasting in the future, combining several prediction methods for which forecasting performance has been checked and compared for a span of several years. Also as a novelty, the 24 hourly time series has been modelled separately, instead of the complete time series of the prices. This allows one to take advantage of the homogeneity of these 24 time series. The purpose of this paper is to select the model that leads to smaller prediction errors and to obtain the appropriate length of time to use for forecasting. These results have been obtained by means of a computational experiment. A mixed model which combines the advantages of the two new models discussed is proposed. Some numerical results for the Spanish market are shown, but this new methodology can be applied to other electricity markets as well. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Economic forecasting","Electricity supply industry","Neural networks","Power generation","Processor scheduling","Prediction methods","Time series analysis","Forward contracts","Computer aided manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","power generation economics","power generation scheduling","power markets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-run forecasting","Spanish market","power generation unit schedule","profit maximization strategy","electricity price forecasting","time series"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design of experiments","electricity markets","forecasting","marginal price","time series analysis"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4162574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.894857","startPage":"544","endPage":"552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4162574/04162593.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.894857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed Models for Short-Run Forecasting of Electricity Prices: Application for the Spanish Market","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mixed Models for Short-Run Forecasting of Electricity Prices: Application for the Spanish Market","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9470470","publicationDate":"May 2007","volume":"22","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4162593/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed Models for Short-Run Forecasting of Electricity Prices: Application for the Spanish Market","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs02-garciamartos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057827S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4162574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4162574","articleId":"4162593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":4162596,"authors":[{"name":"Teoman Guler","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Teoman","lastName":"Guler","id":"37296106300"},{"name":"George Gross","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Gross","id":"37268076300"},{"name":"Minghai Liu","affiliation":["CRAI, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Minghai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289818000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"4162596","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2416},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Power system security","Transmission line matrix methods","Closed-form solution","Power system analysis computing","Distributed computing","Power system faults","Power system protection","Linear approximation","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution economics","power distribution faults","power distribution protection","power markets","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized line outage distribution factors","system security analysis","injection shift factors","blackouts","multiple-line outages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Line outage distribution factors (LODFs)","multiple-line outages","power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs)","system security"]}],"abstract":"Distribution factors play a key role in many system security analysis and market applications.

Decision making is achieved through extended sequential sampling, which manages generator states within specific time periods. The approach can minimize the duration of islanded operation and manage generators' re-connection to the grid. Use of the proposed mechanism and sampling approach offer benefits over conventional relays; incorrect operations due to errors in measurements are reduced because the operational actions are not based on a single decision sample, but instead rely on extended sequential sampling over a number of samples.

Synchronized phasor measurements are applied to aggregate the voltage phase angles of each decomposed subsystem in the distributed state estimation solution.

The proposed approach could be used by vertically integrated utilities as well as the ISOs in electricity markets. In this model, random disturbances, such as outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracies, are modeled as scenario trees using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For dual optimization, coupling constraints among scenarios are relaxed and the optimization problem is decomposed into deterministic long-term SCUC subproblems. For each deterministic long-term SCUC, resource constraints represent fuel and emission constraints (in the case of vertically integrated utilities) and energy constraints (in the case of electricity markets). Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose subproblems with long-term SCUC into tractable short-term MIP-based SCUC subproblems without resource constraints. Accordingly, penalty prices (Lagrangian multipliers) are signals to coordinate the master problem and small-scale subproblems. Computational requirements for solving scenario-based optimization models depend on the number of scenarios in which the objective is to minimize the weighted-average generation cost over the entire scenario tree. In large scale applications, the scenario reduction method is introduced for enhancing a tradeoff between calculation speed and accuracy of long-term SCUC solution.

Fitting an FMM to the data leads to a complex optimization problem. This optimization problem is difficult to solve by standard local optimization methods, such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, if a principled initialization is not available. In this paper, we propose a new global optimization algorithm for the FMM parameter estimation problem, which is based on real coded genetic algorithms. Our specific contributions are two-fold: 1) we propose to use blended crossover in order to reduce the premature convergence problem to its minimum and 2) we introduce a completely new permutation operator specifically meant for the FMM parameter estimation. In addition to improving the optimization results, the permutation operator allows for imposing biologically meaningful constraints to the FMM parameter values. We also introduce a hybrid of the genetic algorithm and the EM algorithm for efficient solution of multidimensional FMM fitting problems. We compare our algorithm to the self-annealing EM-algorithm and a standard real coded genetic algorithm with the voxel classification tasks within the brain imaging. The algorithms are tested on synthetic data as well as real three-dimensional image data from human magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and mouse brain MRI. The tissue classification results by our method are shown to be consistently more reliable and accurate than with the competing parameter estimation methods","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2007.895453","startPage":"696","endPage":"711","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4162626/04162643.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2007.895453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4162626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Finite Mixture Model Based Voxel Classification in Neuroimaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Neuroimaging","Parameter estimation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Optimization methods","Brain modeling","Convergence","Constraint optimization","Biological information theory","Multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical MRI","brain","expectation-maximisation algorithm","genetic algorithms","image classification","medical image processing","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","finite mixture model","voxel classification","neuroimaging","unsupervised classification","brain imaging","optimization","parameter estimation problem","real coded genetic algorithm","self-annealing EM-algorithm","human magnetic resonance imaging","positron emission tomography","mouse brain MRI","tissue classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global optimization","image segmentation","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","parameter estimation","positron emission tomography (PET)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Artificial Intelligence","Brain","Brain","Computer Simulation","Finite Element Analysis","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Mice","Models, Genetic","Models, Neurological","Neuroanatomy","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Positron-Emission Tomography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4162643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Finite Mixture Model Based Voxel Classification in Neuroimaging","volume":"26","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4162643/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9433346","pubMedId":"17518064","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms for Finite Mixture Model Based Voxel Classification in Neuroimaging","sourcePdf":"26tmi05-tohka.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192414S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4162626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4162626","articleId":"4162643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":4163034,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Pablo Carvallo","affiliation":["ETAPA TELECOM"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/52/4163008/4163034/4163034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Pablo Carvallo is the manager of the Informatics department of Etapatelecom, a telecommunications company based in Cuenca, Ecuador, and a part-time teacher at Azuay University's Systems Engineering Department.

It is therefore not surprising that wireless technology is being embraced with increasing vigor. For real-time applications, user satisfaction is closely linked to quantities such as queue length, packet loss probability, and delay. System performance is therefore related to, not only Shannon capacity, but also quality of service (QoS) requirements. This work studies the problem of resource allocation in the context of stringent QoS constraints. The joint impact of spectral bandwidth, power, and code rate is considered. Analytical expressions for the probability of buffer overflow, its associated exponential decay rate, and the effective capacity are obtained. Fundamental performance limits for Markov wireless channel models are identified. It is found that, even with an unlimited power and spectral bandwidth budget, only a finite arrival rate can be supported for a QoS constraint defined in terms of exponential decay rate","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.894682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4167722/04167741.pdf","startPage":"1767","endPage":"1777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.894682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation and Quality of Service Evaluation for Wireless Communication Systems Using Fluid Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167741/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation and Quality of Service Evaluation for Wireless Communication Systems Using Fluid Models","volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9435078","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4167741/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation and Quality of Service Evaluation for Wireless Communication Systems Using Fluid Models","sourcePdf":"53tit05-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075801S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4167722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4167722","articleId":"4167741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4167742,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293264400"},{"name":"Pramod Viswanath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Viswanath","id":"37271448800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4167742","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":868},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Broadcasting","Entropy","Source coding","Information theory","Random variables","Additive noise","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","entropy codes","Gaussian channels","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extremal inequality motivation","multiterminal information-theoretic problem","vector Gaussian broadcast channel","distributed source coding","single quadratic distortion constraint problem","entropy-power inequality","EPI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential entropy","distributed source coding","entropy- power inequality (EPI)","Fisher information","vector Gaussian broadcast channel"]}],"abstract":"We prove a new extremal inequality, motivated by the vector Gaussian broadcast channel and the distributed source coding with a single quadratic distortion constraint problems.

Following the pairwise-error-probability analysis, it is known that in addition to the conventional rank distance criterion, the minimum column distance of (n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\ntimesQ) SF codes serves as another benchmark in code design. SF codes with larger minimum column distance are expected to have better performance. Following this principle, the rate-diversity tradeoff for the MIMO-OFDM channels as well as two SF code constructions are presented. The first construction is obtained by right-multiplying the code matrices in a maximal rank-distance (MRD) code by a fixed (QtimesQ) nonsingular matrix. Codes obtained from this construction are called linearly transformed MRD (LT-MRD) codes. Minimum column distance of the LT-MRD codes, when averaged over all code ensembles, is shown to meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. For the case of constructing the (2times256) quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)-modulated SF codes, it is shown that the LT-MRD codes can provide a much larger minimum column distance at the value of ges50, compared to the values of 3,5, or 6 obtained by other available constructions. The second code construction, termed cyclotomic construction, is reminiscent of the construction of the Reed-Solomon codes except that the code polynomials are now selected according to the cyclotomic cosets of the underlying field. Exact minimum rank distances of the resultant codes are presented. It is shown that this newly constructed code is asymptotically optimal in terms of rate-diversity tradeoff. Bounds on the minimum column distance of these codes are also given","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.894678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4167722/04167744.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.894678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructions of Asymptotically Optimal Space\u2013Frequency Codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167744/","displayDocTitle":"Constructions of Asymptotically Optimal Space\u2013Frequency Codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9435070","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4167744/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructions of Asymptotically Optimal Space\u2013Frequency Codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"53tit05-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094483S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4167722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4167722","articleId":"4167744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4167748,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Moreno","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37266568900"},{"name":"Reza Omrani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineerng-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Omrani","id":"37283191300"},{"name":"P.

Based on the Cayley transform that maps the space of Hermitian matrices to the manifold of unitary matrices, Cayley codes are particularly suitable for high data rate, since they have an easy encoding and can be decoded using a sphere-decoder algorithm. However, at high rate, the problem of evaluating if a Cayley code is fully diverse may become intractable, and previous work has focused instead on maximizing a mutual information criterion. The drawback of this approach is that it requires heavy optimization which depends on the number of antennas and rate. In this work, we study Cayley codes in the context of division algebras, an algebraic tool that allows to get fully diverse codes. We present an algebraic construction of fully diverse Cayley codes, and show that this approach naturally yields, without further optimization, codes that perform similarly or closely to previous unitary differential codes, including previous Cayley codes, and codes built from Lie groups","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4167722/04167749.pdf","startPage":"1911","endPage":"1919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.894681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.894681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Cayley Differential Space\u2013Time Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algebra","MIMO","Mutual information","Decoding","Modulation coding","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Codes","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","algebraic codes","decoding","Hermitian matrices","MIMO systems","space-time codes","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic Cayley differential space-time codes","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO channel","transform","Hermitian matrices","encoding","sphere-decoder algorithm","division algebra"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cayley codes","differential unitary modulation","division algebras","full diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Cayley Differential Space\u2013Time Codes","volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4167749/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9435093","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Cayley Differential Space\u2013Time Codes","sourcePdf":"53tit05-oggier-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0634S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4167722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4167722","articleId":"4167749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4167754,"authors":[{"name":"Ilan Sutskover","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel","Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Sutskover","id":"37298746900"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"},{"name":"Jacob Ziv","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Ziv","id":"37267355900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4167754","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint theory","Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Mutual information","Information analysis","Performance analysis","Jacobian matrices","Error analysis","Bit error rate","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","error statistics","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","binary low-density parity-check code","LDPC","binary-input symmetric-output channel","tracking","error probability","finite dimensional iterative bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","channel coding","Chebyshev systems","entropy","extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts","information combining","information flow","iterative decoding","Lagrange dual problem","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding","mutual information","probability of error","turbo codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper tightens previous information combining bounds on the performance of iterative decoding of binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over binary-input symmetric-output channels by tracking the probability of erroneous bit in conjunction with mutual information.

It has been shown to have a considerably better capability against unexpected sensor faults than the optimal likelihood fusion. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a DCFECC code with minimum Hamming distance fusion. No assumption on identical distribution for local observations, as well as common marginal distribution for the additive noises of the wireless links, is made. In addition, sensors are allowed to employ their own local classification rules. Upper bounds on the probability of error that are valid for any finite number of sensors are derived based on large deviations technique. A necessary and sufficient condition under which the minimum Hamming distance fusion error vanishes as the number of sensors tends to infinity is also established. With the necessary and sufficient condition and the upper error bounds, the relation between the fault-tolerance capability of a DCFECC code and its pair-wise Hamming distances is characterized, and can be used together with any code search criterion in finding the code with the desired fault-tolerance capability. Based on the above results, we further propose a code search criterion of much less complexity than the minimum Hamming distance fusion error criterion adopted earlier by the authors. This makes the code construction with acceptable fault-tolerance capability for a network with over a hundred of sensors practical. Simulation results show that the code determined based on the new criterion of much less complexity performs almost identically to the best code that minimizes the minimum Hamming distance fusion error. Also simulated and discussed are the performance trends of the codes searched based on the new simpler criterion with respect to the network size and the number of hypotheses","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.894670","startPage":"1716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4167722/04167755.pdf","endPage":"1734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.894670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167755/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Code Design for Minimum Hamming Distance Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"53","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9435073","publicationDate":"May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Code Design for Minimum Hamming Distance Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"53tit05-yao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033457S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4167722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4167755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4167759,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Cataliotti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4142913/4167759/4167759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Cataliotti (M'01) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, Palermo, Italy, in 1992 and 1998, respectively.","He is currently with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, where he was an Assistant Professor from 2000 to 2005 and is currently an Associate Professor in electrical measurements.

In the overmodulation range, which is treated by using the alpha-beta components of the reference-voltage space vector, the algorithm shows the advantage of lower calculation time, thus allowing one, if required, to increase the switching frequency. Several simulation runs have been performed, aiming to test the proposed procedure for both two-level and multilevel VSIs.

To address this problem, the method of networked predictive control (NPC) has been proposed, which takes advantage of the feature of the network that a packet of data can be transferred simultaneously. At the controller side, future control sequences for every possible time delay are generated, which are then packed into a single packet and transmitted to the plant side. The plant side receives the packet and chooses the proper control signal based on the time delay measurement. However, this scheme needs an accurate plant mathematical model and the measurement of time delay. In this paper, a new event-driven NPC method is considered where the control signal is selected according to the plant output rather than the time delay measurement. The new method does not need any time delay measurement and can significantly improve the system performance in the presence of model uncertainty.

In modern design flows, physical synthesis tools hardly ever achieve this goal in their first iteration. The design team must iterate by studying the output of the physical synthesis run, then potentially massage the input, e.g., by changing the floorplan, timing assertions, pin locations, logic structures, etc., in order to hopefully achieve a better solution for the next iteration. The complexity of physical synthesis means that systems can take days to run on designs with multimillions of placeable objects, which severely hurts design productivity.

However, today's A/RF designers are increasingly faced with a new challenge. Functional complexity in terms modes of operation, extensive digital calibration, and architectural algorithms is now overwhelming traditional A/RF design methodologies. Functionally verifying A/RF designs is a daunting task requiring a rigorous methodology. As occurred in digital design, analog verification is becoming a separate and critical task. This paper describes the verification issues faced by the A/RF designer and presents a verification methodology to address these challenges. It presents a systematic approach to A/RF verification, the concept of an analog verification engineer, how to establish the methodology, and concludes with an example","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167764","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4167764/04167767.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.889384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.889384","startPage":"622","endPage":"639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verification of Complex Analog and RF IC Designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167767/","displayDocTitle":"Verification of Complex Analog and RF IC Designs","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4167767/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"95","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9438330","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verification of Complex Analog and RF IC Designs","sourcePdf":"95jproc03-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089213S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4167764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4167764","articleId":"4167767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4167775,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Korte","affiliation":["Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4167764/4167775/4167775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bernhard Korte (Member, IEEE) is Professor and Director of the Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics at the University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

The introduction of fast matrix-implicit iterative algorithms completely changed this situation, and extensions of these fast methods are providing tools which can perform periodic, quasi-periodic, and periodic noise analysis of circuits with thousands of devices. Even though there are a number of research groups continuing to develop extensions of matrix-implicit methods, there is still no compact characterization which introduces the novice researcher to the fundamental issues. In this paper, we examine the basic periodic steady-state problem and provide both examples and linear algebra abstractions to demonstrate connections between seemingly dissimilar methods and to try to provide a more general framework for fast methods than the standard time-versus-frequency domain characterization of finite-difference, basis-collocation, and shooting methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","volume":"95","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9438329","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4167776/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fundamentals of Fast Simulation Algorithms for RF Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamentals of Fast Simulation Algorithms for RF Circuits","sourcePdf":"95jproc03-nastov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099358S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4167764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4167764","articleId":"4167776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4167778,"authors":[{"name":"Rob A.

Over the past decade, analog design automation has progressed to the point where there are industrially useful and commercially available tools at the cell level-tools for analog components with 10-100 devices. Automated techniques for device sizing, for layout, and for basic statistical centering have been successfully deployed. However, successful component-level tools do not scale trivially to system-level applications. While a typical analog circuit may require only 100 devices, a typical system such as a phase-locked loop, data converter, or RF front-end might assemble a few hundred such circuits, and comprise 10 000 devices or more. And unlike purely digital systems, mixed-signal designs typically need to optimize dozens of competing continuous-valued performance specifications, which depend on the circuit designer's abilities to successfully exploit a range of nonlinear behaviors across levels of abstraction from devices to circuits to systems. For purposes of synthesis or verification, these designs are not tractable when considered \"flat.\" These designs must be approached with hierarchical tools that deal with the system's intrinsic design hierarchy. This paper surveys recent advances in analog design tools that specifically deal with the hierarchical nature of practical analog and RF systems. We begin with a detailed survey of algorithmic techniques for automatically extracting a suitable nonlinear macromodel from a device-level circuit. Such techniques are critical to both verification and synthesis activities for complex systems. We then survey recent ideas in hierarchical synthesis for analog systems and focus in particular on numerical techniques for handling the large number of degrees of freedom in these designs and for exploring the space of performance tradeoffs early in the design process. Finally, we briefly touch on recent ideas for accommodating models of statistical manufacturing variations in these tools and flows","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","volume":"95","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9438331","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4167778/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Modeling, Optimization, and Synthesis for System-Level Analog and RF Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Modeling, Optimization, and Synthesis for System-Level Analog and RF Designs","sourcePdf":"95jproc03-rutenbar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.241311S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4167764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4167764","articleId":"4167778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4167779,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4167764/4167779/4167779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli (Fellow, IEEE) received the \u201cDottore in Ingegneria\u201d (summa cum laude) from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 1971.","In 1980 and 1981, he was a Visiting Scientist at the Mathematical Sciences Department of the IBM T.J.

SLD means many things to different people since there is no wide agreement on a definition of the term. Academia, designers, and EDA experts have taken different avenues to attack the problem, for the most part springing from the basis of traditional EDA and trying to raise the level of abstraction at which integrated circuit designs are captured, analyzed, and synthesized from. However, my opinion is that this is just the tip of the iceberg of a much bigger problem that is common to all system industry. In particular, I believe that notwithstanding the obvious differences in the vertical industrial segments (for example, consumer, automotive, computing, and communication), there is a common underlying basis that can be explored. This basis may yield a novel EDA industry and even a novel engineering field that could bring substantial productivity gains not only to the semiconductor industry but to all system industries including industrial and automotive, communication and computing, avionics and building automation, space and agriculture, and health and security, in short, a real technical renaissance. In this paper, I present the challenges faced by industry in system level design. Then, I propose a design methodology, platform-based design (PBD), that has the potential of addressing these challenges in a unified way. Further, I place methodology and tools available today in the PBD framework and present a tool environment, Metropolis, that supports PBD and that can be used to integrate available tools and methods together with two examples of its application to separate industrial domains","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.890107","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4167764/04167779.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.890107","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"467","endPage":"506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quo Vadis, SLD?

Our simulation and real world experiments indicate a remarkable performance improvement by using this fusion framework.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2007.353604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167799","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4167798/4167799/04167810.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WLAN-Based Pedestrian Tracking Using Particle Filters and Low-Cost MEMS Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4167810/","displayDocTitle":"WLAN-Based Pedestrian Tracking Using Particle Filters and Low-Cost MEMS Sensors","conferenceDate":"22-22 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9702180","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WLAN-Based Pedestrian Tracking Using Particle Filters and Low-Cost MEMS Sensors","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"WPNC-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135557S","chronDate":"22-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4167798","isNumber":"4167799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4167798","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4167799","articleId":"4167810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4167811,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Ali","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems (DoIS), Cranfield University, Shrivenham, UK"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Ali","id":"38556222000"},{"name":"Philip Nobles","affiliation":["DoIS, Cranfield University, Shrivenham, UK"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Nobles","id":"38556486900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0870-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0871-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4167811","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Indoor Location Sensing Mechanism for IEEE 802.11 b/g Wireless LAN","abstract":"Wireless LAN, now a day exists in most of the organizations. Hardware is inexpensive to buy and easily available off-the-shelf. More and more offices, organizations and public places are installing it for its ease of utilization. Developing location aware services using WLAN has therefore gained tremendous interest in recent years. It is however, still a daunting challenge for the research community to improve location accuracy inside a building to a few meters by means of computing path loss to find distances based on Signal strength of a received RF signal. The accuracy offered by various top-of the-range products using signal strength methods within the indoor environment is not very good. This paper presents a novel method to achieve improved consistency in received signal strength of an RF signal by effectively reducing the multi-path affect on RF propagation inside the building, thus enabling development of better location estimation system.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2007.353605","publicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","startPage":"9","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2007.353605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167799","pdfPath":"/iel5/4167798/4167799/04167811.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","RF signals","Global Positioning System","Radio frequency","Conferences","Navigation","Wireless networks","Distortion","Testing","Floors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","indoor radio","radiowave propagation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor location sensing","IEEE 802.11 b/g wireless LAN","location aware services","wireless local area network","location accuracy","path loss","RF signal strength","indoor environment","multipath affect","RF propagation","location estimation system","indoor radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor Propagation","Location Estimation","Signal Strength","Wireless LAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Indoor Location Sensing Mechanism for IEEE 802.11 b/g Wireless LAN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167811/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4167811/","accessionNumber":"9702181","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"22-22 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Indoor Location Sensing Mechanism for IEEE 802.11 b/g Wireless LAN","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"WPNC-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039705S","chronDate":"22-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4167798","isNumber":"4167799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4167798","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4167799","articleId":"4167811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4167815,"authors":[{"name":"Stephane Beauregard","affiliation":["Technologie-Zentrum Informatik, Universit\u00e4t Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Beauregard","id":"37298861600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0870-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0871-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4167815","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":721},"abstract":"It might be assumed that dead reckoning approaches to pedestrian navigation could address the needs of first responders, including fire fighters.

While these filters are accurate for problems with small nonlinearities and nearly Gaussian noise statistics, they can perform very badly when these conditions do not prevail. In hybrid positioning, large nonlinearities can be caused by the geometry and large outliers (blunder measurements) can arise due to multipath and non line-of-sight signals. It is therefore of interest to find ways to make positioning algorithms based on Kalman-type filters more robust. In this paper two methods to robustify the Kalman filter are presented. In the first method the variances of the measurements are scaled according to weights that are calculated for each innovation, thus giving less influence to measurements that are regarded as blunder. The second method is a Bayesian filter that approximates the density of the innovation with a non-Gaussian density. Weighting functions and innovation densities are chosen using Hubers min-max approach for the epsilon contaminated normal neighborhood, the p-point family, and a heuristic approach. Six robust extended Kalman filters together with the classical extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the second order extended Kalman filter (EKF2) are tested in numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed methods outperform EKF and EKF2 in cases where there is blunder measurement or considerable linearization errors present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-22 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4167819/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9702189","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust Extended Kalman Filtering in Hybrid Positioning Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Extended Kalman Filtering in Hybrid Positioning Applications","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"WPNC-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072699S","chronDate":"22-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4167798","isNumber":"4167799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4167798","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4167799","articleId":"4167819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4167824,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Gigl","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gigl","id":"37403153600"},{"name":"Gerard J.M.

Due to the extremely large bandwidths, the effects of small scale fading are reduced to the level where the knowledge of the path loss model (PLM) can be employed for accurate and reliable distance estimation. This approach enables trilateration based position estimation while significantly reducing the synchronization effort. A limited number of measurements is necessary in order to calibrate the PLM parameters but no extensive database of measurements is required, such as in fingerprinting methods. Based on simulated UWB channels, the effects of uncertainties in the PLM parameters on the estimated distance are characterized.

Whereas several proposals exist to detect these situations, a comprehensive overview, investigation and testing of these methods has to the authors' knowledge not yet been prepared. This paper tries to fill this gap with a classification of the algorithms proposed of the UWB and mobile phone community. In addition, one novel method based on the signal power variation is suggested. Afterwards, the methods are evaluated regarding their practicability for real UWB localization systems, which excludes some of them from further investigation. For the remaining algorithms thresholds are proposed, which are strived to be as independent of the system and environment as possible. Finally, the NLOS detection algorithms are tested and compared with both an UWB simulation environment and an UWB localization test bed.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2007.353628","publicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4167798/4167799/04167834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2007.353628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167799","startPage":"159","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NLOS detection algorithms for Ultra-Wideband localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NLOS detection algorithms for Ultra-Wideband localization","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167834/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-22 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9702204","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4167834/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NLOS detection algorithms for Ultra-Wideband localization","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"WPNC-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071806S","chronDate":"22-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4167798","isNumber":"4167799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4167798","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4167799","articleId":"4167834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4167836,"authors":[{"name":"Sunmi Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory of Yeungnam University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunmi","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291928300"},{"name":"Heedong Choi","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory of Yeungnam University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heedong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290852000"},{"name":"Yongwan Park","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory of Yeungnam University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293566800"},{"name":"Gyuyoung Han","affiliation":["SK Telecom 11, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gyuyoung","lastName":"Han","id":"37287066800"},{"name":"Chaehwan Cho","affiliation":["SK Telecom 11, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chaehwan","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293549100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0870-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0871-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4167836","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Repeaters","Multiaccess communication","Optical receivers","Time difference of arrival","Digital communication","Electromagnetic devices","Optical devices","Leg","Ham radios","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","digital communication","radio repeaters","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repeater effect suppression method","TDOA algorithm","CDMA system","time difference of arrival technique","location techniques","cellular communication system","multiple receivers","digital communication systems","electromagnetic-optical transmission medium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","Location","TDOA","Repeater"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses an improved method for location in CDMA based cellular communication system. The Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technique is one of the most promising location techniques for cellular communication system. This technique is based on estimating the difference in the arrival time of the signal from the source at multiple receivers. In digital communication systems, a repeater is a device that receives a digital signal on an electromagnetic or optical transmission medium and regenerates the signal along the next leg of the medium. Repeaters are commonly used by commercial and amateur radio operators to extend signals in the radio frequency range from one receiver to another. This research analyzes the performance of TDOA techniques in the CDMA system. We consider effect of repeater and it was also found that performance degrades quite gradually with increasing the number of repeater. We adopt a enhanced TDOA technique subtracting the repeater signal from received signal at a handset. We showed that the proposed algorithm has improved performance in TDOA locating system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeater Effect Suppression Method for TDOA algorithm in CDMA system","publicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2007.353630","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4167798/4167799/04167836.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2007.353630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Repeater Effect Suppression Method for TDOA algorithm in CDMA system","conferenceDate":"22-22 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4167836/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9702206","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeater Effect Suppression Method for TDOA algorithm in CDMA system","confLoc":"Hannover, Germany","sourcePdf":"WPNC-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051685S","chronDate":"22-22 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4167798","isNumber":"4167799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4167798","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4167799","articleId":"4167836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4167840,"authors":[{"name":"Dilshod Akbarov","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory, Information and Communication Engineering Department, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dilshod","lastName":"Akbarov","id":"37298921900"},{"name":"Heedong Choi","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory, Information and Communication Engineering Department, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heedong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290852000"},{"name":"Yongwan Park","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Laboratory, Information and Communication Engineering Department, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293566800"},{"name":"Gyuyoung Han","affiliation":["Access Network Deployment Team/Network Research and Development Center, SK Telecom, Seongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gyuyoung","lastName":"Han","id":"37287066800"},{"name":"Jungbae Moon","affiliation":["Access Network Deployment Team/Network Research and Development Center, SK Telecom, Seongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jungbae","lastName":"Moon","id":"37290422100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0870-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0871-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4167840","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Multiaccess communication","Time difference of arrival","Global Positioning System","Iterative methods","Robustness","Hardware","Delay effects","Software measurement","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Global Positioning System","iterative methods","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern matching","CDMA networks","time difference of arrival positioning method","mobile station","GPS","iteration method","diagnostic monitoring software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gpsOne","positioning","pCell","iterative TDOA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper hybrid pattern matching (PM) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) positioning method is proposed to improve a position accuracy of mobile station (MS) in CDMA networks where GPS is not satisfactory.

The Illumimote supports three different light-sensing modalities: incident light intensity, color intensities, and incident light angle (the angle of ray arrival from the strongest source); and two situational sensing modalities: attitude and temperature. The Illumimote achieves high performance, comparable to commercial light meters, while conforming to the size and energy constraints imposed by its application in wireless sensor networks.

The sensor consists of polysilicon resistor heaters, Al/polysilicon thermopiles, and a substrate bipolar transistor located in the center of the sensor chip. The thermopiles and the transistor were used to measure the change of the flow-induced temperature distribution on the flow-sensing surface. The sensor chip was flip-chip packaged on a thin ceramic substrate using a copper pillar bump technology. The polysilicon resistor provides the necessary overheat of the chips, and thermal interactions with the flow are achieved via the pillar bump and the thin ceramic substrate. The operating principle for the packaged sensor remains the same as before packaging. The backside of the ceramic substrate provides a smooth surface for the sensor to be exposed to the flow. Meanwhile, the ceramic substrate holds the sensor chip and protects it from being contaminated or even destroyed by the corrosive environment. The packaged flow sensor shows the good performances compared with the unpackaged sensors. It can detect airflow speed up to 30 m/s with accuracy of 0.5 m/s and airflow direction in a full range of 360 with an accuracy of 6 at room temperature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flip-Chip Packaging for a Two-Dimensional Thermal Flow Sensor Using a Copper Pillar Bump Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2006.888599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4167880/04167886.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2006.888599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4167886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167886/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Flip-Chip Packaging for a Two-Dimensional Thermal Flow Sensor Using a Copper Pillar Bump Technology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4167886/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606384","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flip-Chip Packaging for a Two-Dimensional Thermal Flow Sensor Using a Copper Pillar Bump Technology","sourcePdf":"07jsen07-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098561S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4167880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4167880","articleId":"4167886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4167902,"authors":[{"name":"Vairavan Srinivasan","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Biomedical Techniques (ITAB), G.

The EEG recordings of the ambulatory recording systems generate very lengthy data and the detection of the epileptic activity requires a time-consuming analysis of the entire length of the EEG data by an expert. The traditional methods of analysis being tedious, many automated diagnostic systems for epilepsy have emerged in recent years. This paper proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses approximate entropy (ApEn) as the input feature. ApEn is a statistical parameter that measures the predictability of the current amplitude values of a physiological signal based on its previous amplitude values. It is known that the value of the ApEn drops sharply during an epileptic seizure and this fact is used in the proposed system. Two different types of neural networks, namely, Elman and probabilistic neural networks, are considered in this paper. ApEn is used for the first time in the proposed system for the detection of epilepsy using neural networks. It is shown that the overall accuracy values as high as 100% can be achieved by using the proposed system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167902/","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4167902/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9434352","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"17521078","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Entropy-Based Epileptic EEG Detection Using Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Entropy-Based Epileptic EEG Detection Using Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"11titb03-srinivasan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083516S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"4167888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"399","xplore-issue":"4167888","articleId":"4167902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4167903,"authors":[{"name":"Nipon Theera-Umpon","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Center, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/4167888/4167903/4167903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nipon Theera-Umpon (S'98\u2013M'00\u2013SM'06) received the B.Eng.

In this paper, we investigate whether information about the nucleus alone is adequate to classify white blood cells. This is important because segmentation of nucleus is much easier than the segmentation of the entire cell, especially in the bone marrow where the white blood cell density is very high. In the experiments, a set of manually segmented images of the nucleus are used to decouple segmentation errors. We analyze a set of white-blood-cell-nucleus-based features using mathematical morphology. Fivefold cross validation is used in the experiments in which Bayes' classifiers and artificial neural networks are applied as classifiers. The classification performances are evaluated by two evaluation measures: traditional and classwise classification rates. Furthermore, we compare our results with other classifiers and previously proposed nucleus-based features. The results show that the features using nucleus alone can be utilized to achieve a classification rate of 77% on the test sets.

Presented here is a new measurement method for I/Q imbalance factors that can be performed without significant modification to the radar system, allowing more precise imbalance correction to be achieved.

It has the fourth-order accuracy in the time domain using the symplectic integrator propagator, and the 2M-order accuracy in the space domain using the discrete singular convolution method. The distinctive features between the modified scheme and the traditional (2M, 4) FDTD based on Yee algorithm are listed as follows. First, the modified scheme is based on the wave equation.

The variation of the dispersion coefficient and the end-end gain spectrum of the coaxial fiber Raman amplifier against the core structure as a function of the step, parabolic, and triangular profiles are analyzed. The analysis shows that the dispersion coefficient is sensitive to the variation of the core structure of the fiber, whereas the effective Raman gain coefficient remains nearly constant as the structure changes. Simulations of transmissions employing the coaxial fiber Raman amplifier with the three different structures are carried out individually, and the results show that the parabolic and triangular profiles perform better than the step profile, where the parabolic profile gives the best performance over 80 km of G.652 fiber, with a transmission rate of 20 Gb/s and a gain ripple of plusmn1 dB. In addition, the analysis shows that the maximum negative dispersion wavelength of the fiber exhibits a linear relationship with the normalized core radius.

The link provides symmetrical, bidirectional, full-duplex, and point-to-point communication. It employs 850-nm vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers, radiation-hardened laser-optimized 50/125 mum graded-index fibers, and GaAs p-i-n photo diodes. The transceiver electronics is realized using a multilayer-ceramic-substrate technology that enables the passive alignment of optical fibers to active devices.

It takes a behavioral application specification and produces a schedule to minimize either the completion time or the computing resources required to meet a given deadline. The OS problem is NP-hard; thus, effective heuristic methods are necessary to provide qualitative solutions. We present novel OS algorithms using the ant colony optimization approach for both timing-constrained scheduling (TCS) and resource-constrained scheduling (RCS) problems. The algorithms use a unique hybrid approach by combining the MAX-MIN ant system metaheuristic with traditional scheduling heuristics. We compiled a comprehensive testing benchmark set from real-world applications in order to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms. For TCS, our algorithm achieves better results compared with force-directed scheduling on almost all the testing cases with a maximum 19.5% reduction of the number of resources. For RCS, our algorithm outperforms a number of different list-scheduling heuristics with better stability and generates better results with up to 14.7% improvement.

The use of commodity and embedded flash memories is growing rapidly as we enter the system-on-chip era. Conventional tests for flash memories are usually ad hoc-the test procedure is developed for a specific design. As there is a large number of possible failure modes for flash memories, long test algorithms on complicated automatic test equipment (ATE) are commonly seen. The long test time results in high test cost. We propose a systematic approach in testing flash memories, including the development of March-like test algorithms, cost-effective fault diagnosis methodology, and built-in self-test (BIST) scheme. The improved March-like test algorithms can detect disturb faults-derived from the IEEE STD 1005-and conventional faults. As the memory array architecture and/or cell structure varies, the targeted fault set may change. We have developed a flash-memory fault simulator called RAMSES-FT, with which we can easily analyze and verify the coverage of targeted faults under any given test algorithm. In addition, the RAM test algorithm generator-test algorithm generator by simulation-has been enhanced based on RAMSES-FT, so that one can easily generate tests for flash memories, whether they are bit- or word-oriented. The proposed fault diagnosis methodology helps improve the production yield. We also develop a built-in self-diagnosis (BISD) scheme-a BIST design with diagnosis support. The BISD circuit collects useful test information for off-chip diagnostic analysis. It has unique test mode control that reduces test time and diagnostic data shift-out cycles by a parallel shift-out mechanism","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.885828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.885828","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4167979/04167999.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4167979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flash Memory Testing and Built-In Self-Diagnosis With March-Like Test Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4167999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Flash Memory Testing and Built-In Self-Diagnosis With March-Like Test Algorithms","volume":"26","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9433007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4167999/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash Memory Testing and Built-In Self-Diagnosis With March-Like Test Algorithms","sourcePdf":"26tcad06-yeh2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126235S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4167979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4167979","articleId":"4167999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4168005,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Yang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Yang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37288099700"},{"name":"Cheng-Chien Lee","affiliation":["Laser Process Technology Department, Display Equipment Division,South/Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Chien","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292812700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"4168005","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1381},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion control","Error analysis","Error correction","Computer numerical control","Servomechanisms","Computer errors","Velocity control","Machine tools","Electrical equipment industry","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","error analysis","matrix algebra","motion control","position control","real-time systems","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion controller design","real-time contour error estimation","servomechanisms","position loop controller","tangential-contouring controller","TCC","coordinate transformation matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool","contour error","contour following","tangential\u2013contouring controller (TCC)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Controller Design for Contour-Following Tasks Based on Real-Time Contour Error Estimation","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.894691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4142913","endPage":"1695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4142913/04168005.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.894691","startPage":"1686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4168005","abstract":"Reduction of contour error is an important issue in contour-following applications. One of the common approaches to this problem is to design a controller based on contour error information. However, for the free-form contour-following tasks, there is a lack of effective algorithms for calculating contour errors in real time. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a real-time contour error estimation algorithm. In addition, a motion control scheme that combines a position loop controller (which utilizes a velocity command feedforward) with a tangential-contouring controller (TCC) is employed to improve the contour-following accuracy. When implementing the TCC, a coordinate transformation matrix is needed. Unfortunately, it is difficult to calculate the coordinate transformation matrix when performing the free-form contour-following task. To overcome this difficulty and facilitate the use of contour controllers, a systematic approach is employed to derive the coordinate transformation matrix for the free-form contour-following tasks.

All these features are studied via the state feedback trajectory control design of the translational oscillations with an eccentric rotational proof mass actuator system.

In the literature, many sensorless schemes have been presented, in which the accurate estimation of rotor flux magnitude, position, and speed is guaranteed by detecting the back electromotive force (EMF). However, these schemes show great sensitivity to stator resistance mismatch and system noise, particularly, during low-speed operation. In this paper, an indirect-rotor-field-oriented-control scheme for sensorless speed control of a PMSM is proposed. The rotor-flux position is estimated by direct integration of the estimated rotor speed to reduce the effect of the system noise. The stator resistance and the rotor-flux speed and magnitude are estimated adaptively using stable model reference adaptive system estimators. Simple stability analysis and design of the estimators are performed using linear-control theory applied to an error model of the PMSM in a synchronous rotating reference frame.

Design is performed by applying an NN to minimize the cost function that is selected to depend on the distance from the sliding-mode manifold, thus providing that the NN controller enforces sliding-mode motion in a closed-loop system. It has been proven that the selected cost function has no local minima in controller parameter space, so under certain conditions, selection of the NN weights guarantees that the global minimum is reached, and then the sliding-mode conditions are satisfied; thus, closed-loop motion is robust against parameter changes and disturbances. For controller design, the system states and the nominal value of the control input matrix are used. The design for both multiple-input-multiple-output and single-input-single-output systems is discussed. Due to the structure of the (M)ADALINE network used in control calculation, the proposed algorithm can also be interpreted as a sliding-mode-based control parameter adaptation scheme.

The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle would be 1.66-2.0 times higher","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.892490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4168011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.892490","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4168011/04168012.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batteries and Ultracapacitors for Electric, Hybrid, and Fuel Cell Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Batteries and Ultracapacitors for Electric, Hybrid, and Fuel Cell Vehicles","volume":"95","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4168012/","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9438322","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4168012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batteries and Ultracapacitors for Electric, Hybrid, and Fuel Cell Vehicles","sourcePdf":"95jproc04-burke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095367S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4168011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"508","xplore-issue":"4168011","articleId":"4168012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4168013,"authors":[{"name":"C.

To achieve this goal, the classic techniques of spectral averaging and diagonal loading are integrated into the beamforming, with the former aiming at decorrelation and the latter at robustness against DOA uncertainties. Moreover, the optimal loading is selected based on worst-case performance optimization and a simple closed-form solution to it is suggested after some approximations. Besides its simplicity and low computational cost, this analytical solution reveals how different factors affect the optimal loading. Compared with many relevant methods, the proposed one achieves better robustness against DOA uncertainties, while suppressing both correlated and uncorrelated interferences effectively. Its excellent performance is confirmed via a number of numerical examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117912","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4168033/4117912/04168069.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Robust Adaptive Beamforming in the Presence of Correlated interferences and DOA uncertainties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4168069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4168069/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Robust Adaptive Beamforming in the Presence of Correlated interferences and DOA uncertainties","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285484","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Robust Adaptive Beamforming in the Presence of Correlated interferences and DOA uncertainties","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ISAPE-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050548S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4168033","isNumber":"4117912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4168033","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4117912","articleId":"4168069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4168073,"authors":[{"name":"Ma Hanqing","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Hanqing","id":"37300029300"},{"name":"Li Simin","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Li Simin","id":"37087897391"},{"name":"Ge Guangding","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Guangding","id":"37300027700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0162-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0163-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4168073","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4168073","abstract":"The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the dual frequency matching network for a small size loop antenna.

The reflection coefficient of terahertz wave of conducting plane covered with unmagnetized plasma is computed by using analytic method and finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, respectively.

The analytic method used in this paper is the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) method which often be employed when the properties of the medium vary slowly on a scale comparable to the wavelength. The results illustrate that the attenuation of terahertz wave through a plasma slab is a decreasing function of EM wave frequency, and a decreasing function of plasma collision frequency. Besides, we discover that the absorption tends to zero as the EM-wave frequency approaches terahertz. The agreement of results between PLCDRC-FDTD and WKB methods is shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WKB and FDTD Analysis of Terahertz Band Wave Propagation in Unmagnetized Plasmas","publicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353494","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4168033/4117912/04168155.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4168155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4168155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"WKB and FDTD Analysis of Terahertz Band Wave Propagation in Unmagnetized Plasmas","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4168155/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285569","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WKB and FDTD Analysis of Terahertz Band Wave Propagation in Unmagnetized Plasmas","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ISAPE-00-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06358S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4168033","isNumber":"4117912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4168033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4117912","articleId":"4168155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4168191,"authors":[{"name":"Chiya Saeidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Chiya","lastName":"Saeidi","id":"37300004600"},{"name":"Manouchehr Kamyab","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Manouchehr","lastName":"Kamyab","id":"37300004100"},{"name":"Azim Fard","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Azim","lastName":"Fard","id":"37302082900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0162-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0163-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4168191","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Predictive models","Indoor environments","Optical transmitters","Solid modeling","Geometry","Reflection","Dipole antennas","Indoor radio communication","Radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","radiowave propagation","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast ray tracing propagation prediction model","indoor radio communication environment","numerical calculation","field strength values"]}],"abstract":"A fast brute force ray tracing method employed to analyze indoor radio communication environment.

In the present study, a short-range 35 GHz radio link was used to measure rain specific attenuation with simultaneous measurement of rain rate distribution. The rainfall statistics and attenuation caused by rains are discussed, and an empirical model derived from these measurements is suggested in order to observe and investigate the attenuation caused by rains in short-range communications. A millimeter wave propagation experiment at 103 GHZ on a propagation path of 390 m is conducted. The results were compared with the rain attenuation calculations from the Marshall-Palmer, Best, Joss-Thomas-Waldvogel and Weibull distributions for raindrop size.

The simulated results show that the proposed antennas have a impedance bandwidth of up to 50% (VSWR<2) and steady gain bandwidth (G>5) at whole working frequency band.","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353283","publicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4168033/4117912/04168324.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Bandwidth Enhancement Method of Rectangle Patch Antenna Used in Satellite Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4168324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4168324/","displayDocTitle":"The Bandwidth Enhancement Method of Rectangle Patch Antenna Used in Satellite Communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285723","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4168324/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Bandwidth Enhancement Method of Rectangle Patch Antenna Used in Satellite Communication","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ISAPE-00-291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042414S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4168033","isNumber":"4117912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4168033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4117912","articleId":"4168324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4168327,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shezhen, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37293376700"},{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shezhen, China"],"firstName":"Qinyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289942300"},{"name":"Naitong Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shezhen, China"],"firstName":"Naitong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288734600"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shezhen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292452000"},{"name":"Hongguang Xu","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shezhen, China"],"firstName":"Hongguang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37291047600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0162-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0163-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4168327","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4168327","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Satellite communication","Nonhomogeneous media","Telecommunication network reliability","Spine","Intserv networks","Narrowband","Wideband","Statistical analysis","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IntServ networks","quality of service","satellite links","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive routing strategy","multilayer satellite communication networks","space-based networks","Walker delta type constellation","intersatellite links","inter orbit links","integrated services networks","QoS needs","narrowband services","wideband services","traffic flow","LEO-MEO layers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353286","publicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4168033/4117912/04168327.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Routing Strategy in Multi Layer Satellite Communication Networks","abstract":"The characteristics of multi-coverage of multilayer satellite networks make sure of good validity and reliability of the space-based networks. Walker delta type constellation guarantees permanent inter satellite links between satellites in the same layer and provides nonpermanent inter orbit links, both of which make an autonomic satellite backbone. As a integrated services network, multiplayer satellite network has the ability of fulfilling the QoS needs of different services, including narrow band services and wideband ones, and provides services of different priorities. Adaptive routing behaves better than other routings, because distribution of subscribers must be considered in this strategy. Statistic model describes more precisely the traffic flow from global perspective, and can be used to analysis the relationship of routing delay and number of ISL and average distance of information transmission in LEO and MEO layers. Multilayer satellite network has less total path weight and percent of lost packets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4168327/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10288764","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4168327/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Routing Strategy in Multi Layer Satellite Communication Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Routing Strategy in Multi Layer Satellite Communication Networks","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ISAPE-00-294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076531S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4168033","isNumber":"4117912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4168033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4117912","articleId":"4168327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4168345,"authors":[{"name":"Qinglin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Qinglin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37290439900"},{"name":"Zhuanhong Jia","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zhuanhong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37288159700"},{"name":"Chuanyun Zou","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Chuanyun","lastName":"Zou","id":"37286727100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0162-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0163-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4168345","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Amplitude modulation","Ultra wideband communication","AWGN","Channel capacity","System performance","Performance analysis","Multiple access interference","Additive white noise","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","error statistics","multi-access systems","pulse amplitude modulation","pulse position modulation","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-hopping MN-ary biorthogonal pulse amplitude position modulation","UWB communication system","asynchronous multiple access interference","MAI","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel","symbol error rate","SER","channel capacity","demodulator complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4168345","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2006.353304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4117912","publicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation & EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4168033/4117912/04168345.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Hopping MN-ary Biorthogonal Pulse Amplitude Position Modulation for UWB Communication System","abstract":"The system performance is analyzed using a new modulation scheme called time-hopping(TH) MN-ary biorthogonal pulse amplitude position modulation(MN BPAPM) for ultra wideband(UWB) systems with asynchronous multiple- access interference (MAI) in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

The ambiguity function of PAM DS UWB sharing signal was derived. From numerical simulations, the PAM DS UWB sharing signal yielded the so-called thumbtack ambiguity function.
