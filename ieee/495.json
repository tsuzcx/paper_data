This paper aims at examining a computational method for estimating the domain of attraction of nonlinear system. This very method is based on the concept of a maximal Lyapunov function candidate. The studied algorithm yields a rational Lyapunov function candidate V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n where its the derivative must be negative in a small neighbourhood of the equilibrium. To maximize the region of attraction, one has to minimize the numerator coefficients of V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n. A serious problem of nonlinear optimisation has then occurred. Our main contribution in this work is to implement a genetic algorithm technique in order to determine a maximal Lyapunov function so that we can maximize the estimate of the attraction domain of controlled nonlinear systems. The proposed approach is applied to the well known Van der Pool oscillator. Interesting results are accordingly presented in a numerical simulation study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4956667/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10663804","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4956667/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the estimation of a maximal Lyapunov function and domain of attraction determination via a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the estimation of a maximal Lyapunov function and domain of attraction determination via a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Djerba, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"1569166619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072371S","chronDate":"23-26 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911412","isNumber":"4956638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911412","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4956638","articleId":"4956667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4956669,"authors":[{"name":"Chokri Rekik","affiliation":["Research unit on Intelligent Control, design & Optimization of complex Systems (ICOS) Sfax Engineering School, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Chokri","lastName":"Rekik","id":"37395115400"},{"name":"Mohamed Jallouli","affiliation":["Research unit on Intelligent Control, design & Optimization of complex Systems (ICOS) Sfax Engineering School, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Jallouli","id":"37426318900"},{"name":"Nabil Derbel","affiliation":["Research unit on Intelligent Control, design & Optimization of complex Systems (ICOS) Sfax Engineering School, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Derbel","id":"37284162300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4345-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4346-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4956669","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy control","Mobile robots","Navigation","Fuzzy logic","Optimal control","Design optimization","Motion control","Kinematics","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","gradient methods","mobile robots","navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","optimization","mobile robot","navigation","fuzzy logic controller","gradient method","Khepera II"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy Controller","Genetic Algorithms","Autonomous Mobile Robot","Navigation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4956669","abstract":"This paper presents an optimal fuzzy logic controller design using optimization techniques.

We briefly outline the content of the tuning course and finish the paper with illustrative example where good performances have been obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4956702/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10663838","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4956702/","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"IMC based automatic tuning method of PID controllers using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IMC based automatic tuning method of PID controllers using neural networks","confLoc":"Djerba, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"1569170837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074509S","chronDate":"23-26 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911412","isNumber":"4956638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911412","xplore-issue":"4956638","articleId":"4956702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4956713,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, in many applications a significant effort has to be spent at times, not only to identify adequate antenna setups but also to preserve them when imposing practical restrictions, e.g. satellite station keeping maneuvers. This paper analyzes and quantifies any capacity degradations encountered for the case when the orthogonality of the MIMO channel is violated due to practical constraints. Furthermore, the effort for suitable countermeasures is indicated. In the end it is concluded that all potential sources for capacity shortfalls can be handled at a reasonable effort. The analysis is performed for both types of satellite payloads, the transparent as well as the regenerative transponder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the prospects of MIMO SatCom systems: The tradeoff between capacity and practical effort","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices","doi":"10.1109/SSD.2009.4956789","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4911412/4956638/04956789.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSD.2009.4956789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4956638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4956789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4956789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the prospects of MIMO SatCom systems: The tradeoff between capacity and practical effort","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4956789/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10663922","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the prospects of MIMO SatCom systems: The tradeoff between capacity and practical effort","confLoc":"Djerba, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"1569171719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04803S","chronDate":"23-26 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4911412","isNumber":"4956638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4911412","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4956638","articleId":"4956789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4956804,"authors":[{"name":"Faycal Benrekia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, UYFM-M\u00e9d\u00e9a, Medea, Algeria"],"firstName":"Faycal","lastName":"Benrekia","id":"37640334900"},{"name":"Mokhtar Attari","affiliation":["LINS: Laboratory of Instrumentation, Faculty of Electronics and Computers, University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mokhtar","lastName":"Attari","id":"37271239200"},{"name":"Amine Bermak","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Bermak","id":"37275353200"},{"name":"Khaled Belhout","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, UYFM-M\u00e9d\u00e9a, Medea, Algeria"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Belhout","id":"37640335200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4345-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4346-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4956804","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":540},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4956804","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Field programmable gate arrays","Neural networks","Gas detectors","Programmable logic arrays","Gas industry","Neurons","Testing","Thin film devices","Thin film sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electrical engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","gas sensors","hardware description languages","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets","programmable logic devices","sensor arrays","thin film sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","neural network classifier","gas sensor array applications","gas recognition system","microhotplates","thin film gas sensors","signal collecting unit","signal pattern recognition","backpropagation neural network","field programmable gate array","VHDL language","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["E-nose","Gas sensor","Neural network classifier","VHDL","FPGA-implementation"]}],"abstract":"A primitive gas recognition system which can discriminate limited species of industrial gas was designed and simulated.

Under a suitable assumption on the constraint set and a proper assumption on the objective function, it is proved that for a sufficiently large penalty parameter, there exists a unique global solution to the neural network and the trajectory of the network can reach the feasible region in finite time and stay there thereafter. It is proved that the trajectory of the neural network converges to the set which consists of the equilibrium points of the neural network, and coincides with the set which consists of the critical points of the objective function in the feasible region. A condition is given to ensure the convergence to the equilibrium point set in finite time. Moreover, under suitable assumptions, the coincidence between the solution to the differential inclusion and the ldquoslow solutionrdquo of it is also proved.

Bandwidth reduction is achieved through action potential detection and complete capture of waveforms by means of onchip data buffering.

Classes of monogenic wavelets are proposed with suitable local properties. It is shown that the monogenic wavelet annihilates anti-monogenic signals, that the monogenic wavelet transform is phase-shift covariant and that the transform magnitude is phase-shift invariant.

On the other hand, several attempts have been made to automatically recognize generic images, make them semantically searchable by content, annotate them, and associate them with linguistic indexes. In the course of these attempts, the limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms in mimicking human vision have become exposed. In this paper, we explore the exploitation of this limitation for potentially preventing automated network attacks. While undistorted natural images have been shown to be algorithmically recognizable and searchable by content to moderate levels, controlled distortions of specific types and strengths can potentially make machine recognition harder without affecting human recognition. This difference in recognizability makes it a promising candidate for automated Turing tests [completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHAs)] which can differentiate humans from machines. We empirically study the application of controlled distortions of varying nature and strength, and their effect on human and machine recognizability. While human recognizability is measured on the basis of an extensive user study, machine recognizability is based on memory-based content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and matching algorithms. We give a detailed description of our experimental image CAPTCHA system, IMAGINATION, that uses systematic distortions at its core. A significant research topic within signal analysis, CBIR is actually conceived here as a tool for an adversary, so as to help us design more foolproof image CAPTCHAs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5204506/04956990.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the Human\u2013Machine Gap in Image Recognition for Designing CAPTCHAs","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2022709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2022709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4956990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4956990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the Human\u2013Machine Gap in Image Recognition for Designing CAPTCHAs","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828716","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4956990/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the Human\u2013Machine Gap in Image Recognition for Designing CAPTCHAs","sourcePdf":"04tifs03-rdatta-2022709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079026S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5204506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5204506","articleId":"4956990","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4956992,"authors":[{"name":"Siew-Cheok Ng","affiliation":["Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, MY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5165131/4956992/4956992-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siew-Cheok Ng received the B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in engineering science in 2000 and 2003, respectively, from the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Biomedical Engineering.","His current research interests include biomedical signal processing, pattern recognition, and brain\u2013computer interface technology."]},"firstName":"Siew-Cheok","lastName":"Ng","id":"37628389600"},{"name":"Paramesran Raveendran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5165131/4956992/4956992-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Paramesran Raveendran (S'94-M'95\u2013SM'03) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from South Dakota State University, Brookings, in 1984 and 1985, respectively, and the Dr. Eng degree from the University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan, in 1994.","He was a System Designer with Daktronics.

Quite often, the EEG data are contaminated with artifacts and the application of blind source separation (BSS) alone is insufficient to extract the mu rhythm component. We present a new two-stage approach to extract the mu rhythm component. The first stage uses second-order blind identification (SOBI) with stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to automatically remove the artifacts. In the second stage, SOBI is applied again to find the mu rhythm component. Our method is first compared with independent component analysis with discrete wavelet transform (ICA-DWT) as well as SOBI-DWT, ICA-SWT, and regression method for artifact removal using simulated EEG data. The results showed that the regression method is more effective in removing electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, while SOBI-SWT is more effective in removing electromyogram (EMG) artifacts as compared to the other artifact removal methods. Then, all the methods are compared with the direct application of SOBI in extracting mu rhythm components on simulated and actual EEG data from ten subjects. The results showed that the proposed method of SOBI-SWT artifact removal enhances the extraction of the mu rhythm component.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2021987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5165131/04956992.pdf","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2021987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced - Rhythm Extraction Using Blind Source Separation and Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4956992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4956992/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\mu }$</tex></formula> Rhythm Extraction Using Blind Source Separation and Wavelet Transform","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10763987","pubMedId":"19457744","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4956992/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\mu }$</tex></formula> Rhythm Extraction Using Blind Source Separation and Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tbme-ng-2021987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143699S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5165131","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5165131","articleId":"4956992","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957003,"authors":[{"name":"Lina P.

The results presented in this paper give the key rules to designing a PM motor suitable for sensorless rotor position detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5166536/04957033.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2023387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2023387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless-Oriented Design of PM Motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Voltage","Iron","Stators","Sensorless control","Finite element methods","Bridge circuits","Eddy currents","Inductance","Industry Applications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PM motors","permanent-magnet motor","zero-speed sensorless rotor position detection","high-frequency signal injection","finite-element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-frequency signal injection","low-speed sensorless control","motor design optimization","permanent-magnet (PM) motor","zero-speed sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless-Oriented Design of PM Motors","volume":"45","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4957033/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10781228","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless-Oriented Design of PM Motors","sourcePdf":"tia-bianchi-2023387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05616S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5166536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5166536","articleId":"4957033","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957035,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan H.

In this scheme, the contourlet transform is utilized to decompose images and then extract features to mimic the multichannel structure of HVS. CSF is applied to weight coefficients obtained by the contourlet transform to simulate the appearance of images to observers by taking into account many of the nonlinearities inherent in HVS. JND is finally introduced to produce a noticeable variation in sensory experience.

Analytical methods are applied for the modeling of the machine that is equipped with a diametrically magnetized rotor and a slotless stator. The outer dimensions of the machine are design constraints, and the internal dimensioning is optimized for minimum losses. The air-friction losses are taken into account in addition to the usual iron, copper, and eddy-current losses. Laminated silicon-iron or laminated amorphous iron is used as the stator core material. The results show that air-friction losses influence the optimum design considerably, leading to a small rotor diameter at high speeds. The loss minimization and the amorphous iron core make it possible to reduce the calculated losses by 63% as compared to a machine design not considering air-friction losses. The resulting efficiency is 95% for a 100-W 500 000-r/min machine excluding bearing losses. Experimental results are shown to illustrate the validity of the method.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2023492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5166536/04957060.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2023492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency Optimization of a 100-W 500\u2009000-r/min Permanent-Magnet Machine Including Air-Friction Losses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency Optimization of a 100-W 500\u2009000-r/min Permanent-Magnet Machine Including Air-Friction Losses","volume":"45","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10781239","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957060/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency Optimization of a 100-W 500\u2009000-r/min Permanent-Magnet Machine Including Air-Friction Losses","sourcePdf":"tia-zwyssig-2023492.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088116S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5166536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5166536","articleId":"4957060","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957073,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander W.

Existing solutions, including the standard transmission control protocol (TCP) friendly rate control equation-based congestion controller, are prone to fluctuations in their sending rate and may respond only when packet loss has already occurred. This is a major problem, because both fluctuations and packet loss affect the end-user's perception of the delivered video. A type-1 (T1) fuzzy logic congestion controller (FLC) can operate at video display rates and can reduce packet loss and rate fluctuations, despite uncertainties in measurements of delay arising from congestion and network traffic volatility. However, a T1 FLC employing precise T1 fuzzy sets cannot fully cope with the uncertainties associated with such dynamic network environments. A type-2 FLC using type-2 fuzzy sets can handle such uncertainties to produce improved performance. This paper proposes an interval type-2 FLC that achieves a superior delivered video quality compared with existing traditional controllers and a T1 FLC. To show the response in different network scenarios, tests demonstrate the response both in the presence of typical Internet cross-traffic as well as when other video streams occupy a bottleneck on an All-Internet protocol (IP) network. As All-IP networks are intended for multimedia traffic, it is important to develop a form of congestion control that can transfer to them from the mixed traffic environment of the Internet. It was found that the proposed type-2 FLC, although it is specifically designed for Internet conditions, can also successfully react to the network conditions of an All-IP network. When the control inputs were subject to noise, the type-2 FLC resulted in an order of magnitude performance improvement in comparison with the T1 FLC. The type-2 FLC also showed reduced packet loss when compared with the other controllers, again resulting in superior delivered video quality. When judged by established criteria, such as TCP-friendliness and delayed feedback, fuzzy logic congestion control offers a flexible solution to network bottlenecks. These findings offer the type-2 FLC as a way forward for congestion control of video streaming across packet-switched IP networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Congestion Control for Video Streaming Across IP Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2023325","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5272826/04957083.pdf","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2023325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Congestion Control for Video Streaming Across IP Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4957083/","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891905","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Congestion Control for Video Streaming Across IP Networks","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-fleury-2023325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131965S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5272826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5272826","articleId":"4957083","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4957086,"authors":[{"name":"Sergi Figuerola","affiliation":["I2CAT Foundation, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Sergi Figuerola is the Coordinator of the Network Technologies Cluster of the i2CAT Foundation since 2004.

This makes bandpass sampling the output signal of the nonlinear system without causing aliasing a challenging task. Although the bandpass sampling theory for linear systems is well developed, its counterpart for nonlinear systems is relatively immature in the sense that complete bandpass sampling requirements have only been developed up to third-order nonlinear systems. In this paper, a novel method is used to derived the complete bandpass sampling requirements for nonlinear systems of an arbitrary order. The strategy used by this method is to build the constraints on the sampling frequency for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n th-order nonlinear systems upon those for (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n - 1)th-order nonlinear systems. This process makes the derivation easily extendable to nonlinear systems of any order. The derivation method also gives an insight into the mechanism for formularizing the constraints on the bandpass sampling frequency. As a result, a universal formula for the complete bandpass sampling requirements for nonlinear systems of any order is derived. This formula consolidates the bandpass sampling theory for nonlinear systems and facilitates the selection of the bandpass sampling frequency for nonlinear systems driven by bandpass input signals.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Nonlinear systems","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Radio frequency","Linear systems","Signal analysis","Spectral analysis","Communication systems","High power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear systems","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandpass sampling requirement","nonlinear system","bandpass sampling theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aliasing","bandpass signals","nonlinear systems","sampling methods","signal sampling","spectral domain analysis","Volterra series"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2023356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04957090.pdf","startPage":"3869","endPage":"3878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2023356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Universal Formula for the Complete Bandpass Sampling Requirements of Nonlinear Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Universal Formula for the Complete Bandpass Sampling Requirements of Nonlinear Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957090/","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957090/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10869434","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Universal Formula for the Complete Bandpass Sampling Requirements of Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-ctseng-2023356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081102S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4957090","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4957091,"authors":[{"name":"Gareth W.

Using a Bayesian approach, we construct a model in which we estimate jointly the coefficients of the channel taps, the channel order and decay rate of the power delay profile (PDP).

We assess several aspects of the model in terms of sensitivities to different prior choices. Next we perform a detailed analysis of the performance of each of the TDMCMC algorithms. This allows us to contrast the resulting computational effort required under each approach versus the estimation performance. Finally, using the TDMCMC algorithm which produces the best performance in terms of exploration of the model subspaces, we assess its performance in terms of channel estimation mean-square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve results very close to the case where both the channel length and the PDP decay rate are known.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems With Unknown Power Delay Profile Using Transdimensional MCMC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2023358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04957091.pdf","startPage":"3545","endPage":"3561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2023358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems With Unknown Power Delay Profile Using Transdimensional MCMC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4957091/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816671","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems With Unknown Power Delay Profile Using Transdimensional MCMC","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-inevat-2023358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122919S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4957091","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957095,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Centurelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Centurelli","id":"37271532900"},{"name":"Pietro Monsurro","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Monsurro","id":"37423439400"},{"name":"Salvatore Pennisi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Pennisi","id":"37269876300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Scotti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Scotti","id":"37271531600"},{"name":"Alessandro Trifiletti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Trifiletti","id":"37271530500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4957095","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1899},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Clocks","Switches","Circuit simulation","CMOS process","Signal processing","Dynamic range","Signal to noise ratio","Total harmonic distortion","Temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","harmonic distortion","low-power electronics","nanoelectronics","operational amplifiers","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage sample-and-hold circuit","CMOS nanometer technology","rail-to-rail signal swing","simulated spurious-free dynamic range","signal-to-noise ratio","total harmonic distortion","three-stage low-voltage amplifier","clock voltage doubling","voltage 0.8 V","size 130 nm","power 0.5 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bootstrapped switch","nested Miller compensation","sample-and-hold (S/H)","very low voltage circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957095","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2020945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2020945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5075826/04957095.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Solutions for Sample-and-Hold Circuits in CMOS Nanometer Technologies","abstract":"Solutions for the design of low-voltage sample-and-hold (S/H) circuits in CMOS nanometer technologies are presented.

These results predict that some degree of engineered randomness may prove to be a useful signal-processing feature in future nanoelectronic systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5075826/04957096.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2020946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2020946","startPage":"484","endPage":"488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic LDPC-Coded Fault Compensation Technique for Reliable Nanoscale Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957096/","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic LDPC-Coded Fault Compensation Technique for Reliable Nanoscale Computing","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957096/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10705073","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic LDPC-Coded Fault Compensation Technique for Reliable Nanoscale Computing","sourcePdf":"tcsii-winstead-2020946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097186S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5075826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5075826","articleId":"4957096","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4957099,"authors":[{"name":"Simin Chen","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Centre of Ultra-Broadband Information Networks, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Simin Chen was born in Fujian, China.

The performance of the control algorithm as applied to a quarter vehicle is evaluated through simulations and experimental studies that include sudden changes in road conditions.

A transformer is used to extend the extremely low duty cycle of a conventional buck converter. Turn-off losses can be significantly reduced due to the extension of duty cycle, and there are no turn-on losses owing to the zero-voltage turn-on condition. At the same time, the voltage stress over the synchronous rectifier MOSFETs is also reduced. Therefore, the reverse-recovery losses of the body diode can be reduced. Furthermore, the MOSFETs with lower voltage rating and lower RDS(on) can be used to reduce the conduction losses. In order to reduce the turn-off losses above the switching frequency of 1 MHz further, a new current-source driver is also proposed, which is suitable to this new topology. A 12-V input prototype with the switching frequency of 1 MHz was implemented. Simulation and experimental results verify the functionality and benefits of the proposed topology.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04957107.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2023102","startPage":"3096","endPage":"3105","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2023102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Nonisolated ZVS Asymmetrical Buck Voltage Regulator Module With Direct Energy Transfer","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957107/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793149","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonisolated ZVS Asymmetrical Buck Voltage Regulator Module With Direct Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2023102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096963S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4957107","onlineDate":"19 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4957128,"authors":[{"name":"Emiliano Pereira","affiliation":["ETS Ingenieros industriales, University of Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"],"firstName":"Emiliano","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37400475200"},{"name":"Sumeet S.

A highly nonlinear dynamic model of the system has been used to design the robust controller. According to the nonlinear model a polytopic model has been developed considering the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the plant. To this end, a subset of polytopic model is extracted to cover the necessary dynamics of the system in order to make the optimisation problem more feasible. In other words, the subset of polytopic model mitigates the stringent conditions imposed due to robustness. However, some additional conditions on inputs, outputs and states may need to be imposed in order to prevent any violation from the polytope. When the control system is infeasible, the polytope is redesigned and a new optimisation problem is formulated, accordingly. The robust model predictive control approach based on linear matrix inequalities has been used as a regulator in this study. The responses of the control system show the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed control technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust model predictive control of a twin rotor MIMO system","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2009.4957145","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4914928/4957110/04957145.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2009.4957145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust model predictive control of a twin rotor MIMO system","conferenceDate":"14-17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957145/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10661402","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust model predictive control of a twin rotor MIMO system","confLoc":"Malaga, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF-001724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076311S","chronDate":"14-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4914928","isNumber":"4957110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4914928","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4957110","articleId":"4957145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4957154,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Voos","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences Ravensburg-Weingarten, Weingarten, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Voos","id":"37640097300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4194-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4195-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4957154","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4805},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Control systems","Robots","Surveillance","Navigation","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Vehicle dynamics","Payloads","Linear feedback control systems","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","feedback","linearisation techniques","microrobots","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","remotely operated vehicles","rotors","steering systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrotor micro-UAV","micro aerial robots","feedback linearization","nonlinear control","unmanned aerial vehicles","steering principle","stabilizing control","nonlinear dynamic behavior","nonlinear vehicle control system","embedded microcontroller"]}],"abstract":"Four-rotor micro aerial robots, so called quadrotor UAVs, are one of the most preferred type of unmanned aerial vehicles for near-area surveillance and exploration both in military and commercial in- and outdoor applications. The reason is the very easy construction and steering principle using four rotors in a cross configuration. However, stabilizing control and guidance of these vehicles is a difficult task because of the nonlinear dynamic behavior. In addition, the small payload and the reduced processing power of the onboard electronics are further limitations for any control system implementation. This paper describes the development of a nonlinear vehicle control system based on a decomposition into a nested structure and feedback linearization which can be implemented on an embedded microcontroller.

It is shown that the comparison between the residual and these constants (-3/2, -1/2, 1/2 and 3/2) needed in the radix-2 on line multiplication, present problem in high precision computation. However, in the proposed method the operands are introduced digit by digit with MSDF mode and results are obtained in the same manner with fixed time delay independently of the operand size. So, this approach is advantageously used for the long multiplication computation. This method has been tested by the execution of a program developed with Maple 9.5 for several test vectors. The results of the implementation of this multiplier for several operands sizes (128, 256, 512, and 1024) on Virtex-II FPGA Circuit confirm that the multiplication is performed in constant time.","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2009.4957240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2009.4957240","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4914928/4957110/04957240.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Left to right serial multiplier for large numbers on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957240/","displayDocTitle":"Left to right serial multiplier for large numbers on FPGA","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10661497","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957240/","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Left to right serial multiplier for large numbers on FPGA","confLoc":"Malaga, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF-006734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05379S","chronDate":"14-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4914928","isNumber":"4957110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4914928","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4957110","articleId":"4957240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4957270,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The pilot sequence is designed using the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) of the Golay complementary sequences. Novel exploitation of the perfect autocorrelation property of the Golay codes, in conjunction with OSTBC (Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code) based pilot waveform scheduling across multiple OFDM frames, facilitates simple separation of the channel mixtures at the receive antennas. The DFT length used to transform the complementary sequence into the frequency domain is shown to be a key critical parameter for correctly estimating the channel. NMSE (Normalized Mean Squared Error) between the actual and the estimated channel is used to characterize the estimation performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957309.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM using complementary codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM","MIMO","Partial transmit sequences","Autocorrelation","Block codes","Receiving antennas","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","Golay codes","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM","complementary codes","pilot-assisted method","frequency selective channel","multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","DFT","discrete Fourier transform","Golay complementary sequences","perfect autocorrelation property","orthogonal space-time block code","waveform scheduling","receive antennas","normalized mean squared error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","OSTBC","DFT","Golay complementary sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM using complementary codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957309/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10660942","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM using complementary codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MO4C-1-334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047507S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4957310,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Unfortunately, it is known that the number of feedback bits per mobile terminal must be scaled with the number of transmit antennas and system signal to noise ratio. Therefore very high resolution codebooks are needed to approach the theoretically achievable sum rate. In this paper, we propose a geodesic prediction algorithm to 1) reduce the feedback overhead under temporally correlated channels, and 2) improve on the sum rate ceiling observed with a fixed codebook size. The proposed algorithm provides local refinement of the CSI thereby achieving higher resolution CSI at the transmitter despite of using a fixed codebook size. Furthermore, feedback can be performed infrequently to lower the average feedback rate. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957311.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"170","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geodesic prediction for limited feedback multiuser MIMO systems in temporally correlated channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","State feedback","Channel state information","Mobile antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Signal to noise ratio","Signal resolution","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","differential geometry","feedback","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geodesic prediction","limited feedback multiuser MIMO systems","temporally correlated channels","multiuser multi-antenna systems","partial channel state information","transmitter","high resolution codebooks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Systems","multiuser channels","prediction methods","Grassmann manifold"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Geodesic prediction for limited feedback multiuser MIMO systems in temporally correlated channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957311/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10660944","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geodesic prediction for limited feedback multiuser MIMO systems in temporally correlated channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MO4C-3-374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067982S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4957312,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The effects of antenna element separation, array orientation, angle spread, and mutual coupling are compared for the models. The SCM performance showed the best agreement with how measurement results from the literature depend on the parameters studied, followed by the A-SCM and then the LTE model.

Typical in-vehicle scenarios, including line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), different distance, impact of passengers, were considered. The objective of this work is to obtain a better assessment of the potentials of in-vehicle communications by characterizing the wideband in-vehicle communication channels. Results showed that the energy arrives in clusters, and that the abundant scatters and absorber caused dense multipath scattering. Further analysis of the results showed the power delay profile could be basically modeled by a Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) model. It is also noticed that delay spread and thus the coherence bandwidth depended only slightly on the distance, mainly on the structure of the car interior and layout of the passengers.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957318","startPage":"191","endPage":"194","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957318.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and characterization of wideband channel for in-vehicle environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and characterization of wideband channel for in-vehicle environment","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957318/","accessionNumber":"10660951","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957318/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and characterization of wideband channel for in-vehicle environment","confLoc":"San Diego, CA","sourcePdf":"TU1A-4-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058418S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4957320,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ramadan Ali","affiliation":["Chair of Microwave and Communication Engineering, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ali Ramadan","lastName":"Ali","id":"37955227600"},{"name":"Abdullah I.

In this paper, we carry out a performance evaluation of uplink single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO), both for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) under LTE parameters. Different MIMO schemes such as single-input-multiple-output (SIMO), spatial multiplexing (SM) and transmit diversity with space-frequency coding (SFC) are investigated. Results show that OFDMA tends to outperform SC-FDMA for 2 receive antennas. However, this gap is reduced when 4 antennas are considered at the receiver. Furthermore, it is shown that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the SC-FDMA signal is increased about 0.6 dB, when SFC is employed; nevertheless, a gain of 2 dB over OFDMA is still preserved.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957339","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957339.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","startPage":"304","endPage":"307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-user MIMO for LTE-A Uplink: Performance evaluation of OFDMA vs. SC-FDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-user MIMO for LTE-A Uplink: Performance evaluation of OFDMA vs. SC-FDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957339/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10660971","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957339/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-user MIMO for LTE-A Uplink: Performance evaluation of OFDMA vs. SC-FDMA","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU2P-18-118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048084S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4957340,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Ranvier","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD center of excellence, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Ranvier","id":"37270539900"},{"name":"Mikko Kyro","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD center of excellence, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Kyro","id":"37319847300"},{"name":"Katsuyuki Haneda","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD center of excellence, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Katsuyuki","lastName":"Haneda","id":"37269842700"},{"name":"Tuomas Mustonen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD center of excellence, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Mustonen","id":"37640535800"},{"name":"Clemens Icheln","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD center of excellence, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Icheln","id":"37273178800"},{"name":"Pertti Vainikainen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, SMARAD center of excellence, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Pertti","lastName":"Vainikainen","id":"37280837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2698-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2699-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4957340","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":799},"abstract":"This paper presents a wide band 60 GHz MIMO channel measurement system using a VNA and 3-D arrays at both ends.

As we know, the subchannels' signal-to-noise radio (SNR) by singular value decomposition (SVD) are unequal, which requires different modulation and coding schemes (MCS) to maximize the throughput. However, uniform channel decomposition (UCD) greatly reduces the coding and modulation complexity by decomposing the MIMO channel into multiple subchannels with identical capacity. This paper analyzes the post-detection SINR of different MIMO transmission modes and presents their throughput performance with link adaptation under the constraint of required packet error rate (PER). We show that UCD mode is the first choice at high SNR considering both coding/modulation complexity and throughput performance, while at low SNR, space-time block coding (STBC) mode outperforms other MIMO transmission modes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957342.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"315","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of different MIMO transmission modes with link adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","MIMO","Modulation coding","Throughput","User centered design","WiMAX","Receiving antennas","Singular value decomposition","Decoding","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","MIMO communication","singular value decomposition","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","MIMO transmission modes","link adaptation","modulation level","coding rate","channel condition","multi-input multi-output transmission modes","signal-to-noise radio","singular value decomposition","modulation scheme","coding scheme","uniform channel decomposition","MIMO channel","packet error rate","space-time block coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Link Adaptation","MIMO","Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)","Uniform Channel Decomposition (UCD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of different MIMO transmission modes with link adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957342/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10660974","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of different MIMO transmission modes with link adaptation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU2P-20-210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049487S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4957344,"authors":[{"name":"Muthanna Al-Mahmoud","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Muthanna","lastName":"Al-Mahmoud","id":"38272248500"},{"name":"Michael D.

Combined with the successive interference cancellation scheme, this novel codeword selection strategy is shown to improve SINR and subsequently the frame error rate performance of a MIMO-OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957346","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957346.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel codeword selection strategy for MIMO precoding with limited channel state information feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957346/","displayDocTitle":"Novel codeword selection strategy for MIMO precoding with limited channel state information feedback","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10660978","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957346/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel codeword selection strategy for MIMO precoding with limited channel state information feedback","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU2P-24-183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041453S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4957347,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To meet these challenges, several design improvements to an RF power scavenging circuit integrated directly onto CMOS are presented. These improve RF to DC conversion efficiency through a reduction in the body effect and threshold voltage of diode connected MOSFETs and by reducing the sources of circuit parasitics that are unique to integrated circuits. Utilizing these improvements, a design goal of generating a 1V output voltage with a greater than 20% RF to DC conversion efficiency from RF energy levels measured in the environment (66 uW) was met. This represents better than double the RF to DC conversion efficiency of the conventional power matched RF energy harvesting circuit based on a Villard voltage doubler. The complete system, including matching circuitry is integrated directly onto a 130 nm CMOS process with no external passives and measures only 300 um by 600 um meeting the strict form factor requirement of Smartdust systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10660979","htmlLink":"/document/4957347/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Parasitic aware optimization of an RF power scavenging circuit with applications to Smartdust sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parasitic aware optimization of an RF power scavenging circuit with applications to Smartdust sensor networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU2P-25-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04102S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4957350,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Although it is feasible to manually identify clusters via visual inspection, this task becomes very difficult and time consuming when a large amount of data needs to be processed. Furthermore, visual inspection highly depends on the person who performs the cluster identification task, which may cause inconsistent or unrepeatable results. In this paper, we propose an automatic procedure to identify clusters in UWB impulse responses. The algorithm takes both the amplitude and time delay into account when finding the clusters. The algorithm performs well. If the threshold is set correctly, there will not be any error.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Inspection","Performance evaluation","Time measurement","Asia","Ultra wideband technology","Delay effects","Error correction","Transceivers","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiowave propagation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic UWB clusters identification","clustering phenomenon","ultra-wideband impulse responses","visual inspection","UWB impulse responses","time delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","cluster identification","intra-vehicle","multipath"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957359","startPage":"376","endPage":"379","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957359.pdf","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic UWB clusters identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic UWB clusters identification","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10660989","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957359/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic UWB clusters identification","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU2P-36-147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052198S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4957364,"authors":[{"name":"Duy T.

Taking the maximization of system throughput as the design objective, an efficient resource allocation scheme is proposed for such systems under constraints on total system bandwidth and transmit power at the base station. Different from existing methods in the literature, our solution also considers the issue of fair resource utilization among multicast groups by guaranteeing minimum numbers of subchannels to be assigned to individual groups according to their respective channel conditions and group sizes. Once the subcarrier allocation is accomplished, the power allocation is performed in a water-filling fashion. The proposed algorithm distributes the throughput more flexibly and fairly between groups and, at the same time, still achieves a high total sum rate. The potential of our approach is confirmed by numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957364.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"395","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient resource allocation for OFDMA multicast systems with fairness consideration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Bandwidth","OFDM","Scholarships","Wireless networks","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy","Base stations","Multicast algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDM A multicast systems","resource utilization","system throughput","total system bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient resource allocation for OFDMA multicast systems with fairness consideration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957364/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10660994","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient resource allocation for OFDMA multicast systems with fairness consideration","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU2P-40-226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082649S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4957368,"authors":[{"name":"I.

We consider power control in a cooperative communication system consisting of multiple sources and multiple relays and the relay is assumed to be amplify-and-forward. We proposes a new distributed power control algorithm for cooperative relaying(DPCCR). In this distributed algorithm, each source updates its power level iteratively using estimates of the inverse of the signal-to-interference and noise ratio(SINR) of its own channel. We analyzes convergence properties of proposed algorithms by using standard techniques. Simulation results show that a respectable decrease in system outage performance and power saving can be achieved, when compared with other power control algorithm without relaying.","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957394","startPage":"486","endPage":"489","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957394.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power control for cooperative relaying with fixed amplifying gain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power control for cooperative relaying with fixed amplifying gain","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957394/","accessionNumber":"10661021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957394/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power control for cooperative relaying with fixed amplifying gain","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"TU3B-4-317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052146S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4957399,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad El-Khatib","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CPFR, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ziad","lastName":"El-Khatib","id":"38274240100"},{"name":"Leonard MacEachern","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CPFR, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"MacEachern","id":"37269976500"},{"name":"Samy A.

It incorporates three power back-off modes with enhanced efficiency and provides a high tolerance to load variations in all modes. This approach offers sufficient linearity for high crest factor signals such as WCDMA and EDGE without requiring any predistortion. The conditions for optimum operation of the PA topology, based on power combining of parallel amplifier stages with quadrature hybrids, are derived.

It was proposed to trade off system hardware cost and system performance by keeping the same number of antennas and using a fewer RF chains. In this paper, we consider the joint transmit and receive antenna selection capacity-maximization problem in MIMO systems. The optimal joint transmit and receive antenna selection could be achieved by exhaustively searching all the transmit and receive antenna subsets. However, its applicability is limited due to the high computational complexity. The existing suboptimal algorithms decouple the selection into transmit antenna selection and receive antenna selection, and exhibit a performance loss compared to the optimal method. We propose JTRAS, a greedy algorithm to jointly select the transmit and receive antennas to maximize the channel capacity. We will demonstrate that JTRAS performs very close to the optimal exhaustive search method and outperforms the existing suboptimal algorithms. We will also investigate the computational complexity of JTRAS and show it is much lower than that of the optimal solution. Capacity performance of our proposed JTRAS algorithm will be provided by simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957411.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"557","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A near-optimal joint transmit and receive antenna selection algorithm for MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","MIMO","Computational complexity","Hardware","Costs","System performance","Radio frequency","Transmitting antennas","Performance loss","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","computational complexity","MIMO communication","optimisation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","near-optimal joint transmit and receive antenna selection algorithm","receive antenna selection capacity-maximization problem","computational complexity","optimal exhaustive search method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ceramics","coaxial resonators","delay filters","delay-lines","power amplifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A near-optimal joint transmit and receive antenna selection algorithm for MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957411/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661038","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near-optimal joint transmit and receive antenna selection algorithm for MIMO systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WE1B-1-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052239S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4957412,"authors":[{"name":"Raghuram Ranganathan","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Raghuram","lastName":"Ranganathan","id":"37543374800"},{"name":"Wasfy Mikhael","affiliation":["University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Wasfy","lastName":"Mikhael","id":"37278081800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2698-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2699-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-2958"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-2974"}],"articleNumber":"4957412","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Convergence","Adaptive arrays","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading","Signal processing","Least mean square algorithms","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","array signal processing","error statistics","fading channels","least mean squares methods","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital beamforming technique","homogeneous adaptation","time-varying convergence factors","least mean square algorithm","complex adaptive filter coefficients","multiantenna receiver","quadrature amplitude modulation signals","symbol error rate","flat fading channel","fixed convergence factor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957412","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957412","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","abstract":"In this paper, a novel complex homogeneous adaptation least mean square algorithm (complex HA-LMS) for digital beamforming is presented.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive hybrid MIMO scheme that the perfect STBC is adopted to transmit together with the Alamouti STBC. Since the perfect STBC obtains the full diversity gain and full rate, it can increase the reliability without loss of efficiency.

To extract the available rich multipath diversity, we employ orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with precoding. Through the derivation of pairwise error probability (PEP), we demonstrate that the maximum diversity order is given by the summation of the channel length in the direct link and the minimum of channel lengths in each relaying link which is further confirmed by simulation results. Based on the PEP expression, we also propose two relay selection strategies; one is on per-subcarrier basis and the other is on all-subcarriers basis.

In particular, we assume the system exist a maximum allowable simultaneously transmissions M which is dependent on the degree of multiple access interference (MAI). To control the access of multiple code channels in DS-CDMA wireless network, we define the channel regulation (CR) which is smaller than M and three channel states which are random access (RA) state, CR state and busy state respectively. The channel is in RA state, CR state and busy state whenever simultaneously transmissions are smaller than CR, between CR and M and larger than M respectively. Nodes can randomly access channel whenever they detect RA state and do p-persistent transmission while CR state is detected. If channel is detected in busy state, nodes have to run backoff algorithm to prepare next time of transmission. The simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol algorithm performs very well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4906267/4957268/04957445.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"690","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium","doi":"10.1109/RWS.2009.4957445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS.2009.4957445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multiple code channels MAC protocol in DS-CDMA wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Multiaccess communication","Wireless networks","Multiple access interference","Chromium","Signal processing algorithms","Access protocols","Access control","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","code division multiple access","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple code channels","MAC Protocol","DS-CDMA wireless networks","single channel wireless network","multiple access interference","channel regulation","random access state"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel regulation (CR)","medium access control (MAC)","direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA)","carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)","p-persistent CSMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new multiple code channels MAC protocol in DS-CDMA wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957445/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10661070","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multiple code channels MAC protocol in DS-CDMA wireless networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WE3C-1-280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066859S","chronDate":"18-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4906267","isNumber":"4957268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4906267","xplore-issue":"4957268","articleId":"4957445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4957497,"authors":[{"name":"Kartikeya Murari","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4957493/4957497/4957497-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kartikeya Murari (S'02) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2004.

So far, an increase in some of the even harmonics in the field current has been reported to detect such faults. However, no explanation has been provided for the cause of these harmonics. Moreover, the even harmonics can significantly increase with supply unbalance as well as time harmonics, which can lead to a serious confusion. Hence, in this study, an in-depth investigation was conducted to determine the origin of various harmonic components in the field current and their feasibility to detect stator faults. It was found that, owing to structural asymmetries of the field winding, some of these components clearly increased with stator interturn fault. The findings are helpful to detect faults involving few turns without ambiguity, in spite of the presence of supply unbalance and time harmonics. Both simulation and experimental results are presented in this paper. The diagnosis results have also been verified using a rotor-mounted search coil, which can also be used to detect even a one-turn stator fault very effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-june  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-june 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664574","htmlLink":"/document/4957500/","displayDocTitle":"Stator Interturn Fault Detection of Synchronous Machines Using Field Current and Rotor Search-Coil Voltage Signature Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stator Interturn Fault Detection of Synchronous Machines Using Field Current and Rotor Search-Coil Voltage Signature Analysis","sourcePdf":"tia-nandi-2018905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109566S","chronDate":"May-june  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4957498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4957498","articleId":"4957500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4957501,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Bianchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4957498/4957501/4957501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Bianchi (M'98) received the Laurea and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 1991 and 1995, respectively.","Since 1998, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, as a Senior Research Assistant in the Electric Drives Laboratory.

Currently available power inverter systems for HEVs use a dc-dc boost converter to boost the battery voltage for a traditional three-phase inverter. The present HEV traction drive inverters have low power density, are expensive, and have low efficiency because they need a bulky inductor. A cascaded H-bridge multilevel boost inverter design for EV and HEV applications implemented without the use of inductors is proposed in this paper. Traditionally, each H-bridge needs a dc power supply. The proposed design uses a standard three-leg inverter (one leg for each phase) and an H-bridge in series with each inverter leg which uses a capacitor as the dc power source. A fundamental switching scheme is used to do modulation control and to produce a five-level phase voltage. Experiments show that the proposed dc-ac cascaded H-bridge multilevel boost inverter can output a boosted ac voltage without the use of inductors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC\u2013AC Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Boost Inverter With No Inductors for Electric/Hybrid Electric Vehicle Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2018978","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4957498/04957506.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2018978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-june  2009","displayDocTitle":"DC\u2013AC Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Boost Inverter With No Inductors for Electric/Hybrid Electric Vehicle Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4957506/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"May-june 2009","accessionNumber":"10664583","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC\u2013AC Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Boost Inverter With No Inductors for Electric/Hybrid Electric Vehicle Applications","sourcePdf":"tia-ozpineci-2018978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066876S","chronDate":"May-june  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4957498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"4957498","articleId":"4957506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957508,"authors":[{"name":"Eyyup Demirkutlu","affiliation":["Elsis, Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4957498/4957508/4957508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eyyup Demirkutlu (M'09) was born in Erzincan, Turkey, in 1980.

This simple scalar method provides superior performance, and unlike the vector methods, it is easy to implement.

Control is carried out by a standard IC controller for peak current-mode DC-DC converters, with only an additional compensation ramp generator and peak detector. The fact that neither an analog multiplier nor an input voltage sensor is needed to achieve quasi-sinusoidal line waveforms makes this method very attractive. The method is similar to the one-cycle control method, but can be very easily adapted for use with topologies different to the boost converter, i.e., flyback, buck-boost, single-ended primary inductance converter, Cuk, and zeta topologies. Moreover, as the line current is cycle-by-cycle controlled, the resulting input current feedback loop is extremely fast, thus allowing the use of this type of control with high-frequency lines.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2009.2018935","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4957498/04957511.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1027","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2009.2018935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Voltage-Controlled Compensation Ramp: A Waveshaping Technique for Power Factor Correctors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-june  2009","displayDocTitle":"The Voltage-Controlled Compensation Ramp: A Waveshaping Technique for Power Factor Correctors","volume":"45","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4957511/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-june 2009","accessionNumber":"10664588","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Voltage-Controlled Compensation Ramp: A Waveshaping Technique for Power Factor Correctors","sourcePdf":"tia-sebastian-2018935.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074512S","chronDate":"May-june  2009","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4957498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4957498","articleId":"4957511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4957512,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Pan","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4957498/4957512/4957512-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo (Zach) Pan (S'02\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1997, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, in 2005.","He is currently a Power Electronics R&D Engineer with the ABB Corporate Research Center, Raleigh, NC.

Although the two formulations exhibit similar performance under linear operating conditions, the performance of the mesh-based model is significantly better than that of the nodal-based model under nonlinear operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4957563/04957571.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.2002037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.2002037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Nodal- and Mesh-Based Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equivalent circuits","Saturation magnetization","Magnetic flux","Magnetic analysis","Nonlinear equations","Jacobian matrices","Circuit analysis computing","Computational efficiency","Electric machines","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","machine theory","magnetic circuits","Newton-Raphson method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nodal-based magnetic equivalent circuit model","mesh-based magnetic equivalent circuit model","magnetic system","Newton-Raphson algorithm","algebraic system","computational efficiency","machine design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC)","permeance","reluctance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Nodal- and Mesh-Based Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Models","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4957571/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664095","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Nodal- and Mesh-Based Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Models","sourcePdf":"tec-pekarek-2002037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078986S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4957563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4957563","articleId":"4957571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957574,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixin Miao","affiliation":["Transmission Asset Management Department, Midwest ISO, Inc., Saint Paul, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhixin Miao (S'00\u2013M'03) received the BSEE degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1992 the MSEE degree from the Graduate School of Nanjing Automation Research Institute, Nanjing, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from West Virginia University, Morgantown.","He is with the Transmission Asset Management Department in Midwest ISO, St. Paul, MN, since 2002.

One of the primary concerns in designing a stand-alone PV system is the determination of an optimum relationship between the PV array and storage battery capacity to supply the required energy at a specified energy load fraction. In this paper, a complete analytical methodology has been presented for that. The solar radiation utilizability concept and the monthly average daily PV array efficiency have been used to estimate the performance of a stand-alone PV system and hence for the designing. The techno-economic optimization of a PV system has been done by using levelized energy cost computation based on the total number of battery replacements (brp's) through battery life-cycle model by using the solar radiation utilizability concept over the life period of the system. It has been found that energy load fractions as well as the number of brp's have a significant impact on the selection of optimum sizing of a stand-alone PV system.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.2001455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4957563/04957580.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.2001455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techno-Economic Optimum Sizing of a Stand-Alone Solar Photovoltaic System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957580/","displayDocTitle":"Techno-Economic Optimum Sizing of a Stand-Alone Solar Photovoltaic System","volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664088","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957580/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techno-Economic Optimum Sizing of a Stand-Alone Solar Photovoltaic System","sourcePdf":"tec-kolhe-2001455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100357S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4957563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4957563","articleId":"4957580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4957590,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Muralidhar","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics and University of Pavia, Singapore"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Muralidhar","id":"37578762300"},{"name":"Kwok Hung Li","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kwok Hung","lastName":"Li","id":"37277618400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4957590","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":721},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Channel estimation","OFDM","Vectors","Mean square error methods","Decorrelation","Asia","Frequency estimation","State estimation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Kalman filters","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity Kalman filter","channel estimation","doubly-selective OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","vector state-scalar observation filter","spectral efficiency","quasistatic channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BEM","doubly-selective","ICI","Kalman","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a vector state-scalar observation (VSSO) Kalman filter for channel estimation in doubly-selective orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Most previous works handle the problem with symmetry constraints by imposing symmetric-feasible conditions in floorplan representations and using cost functions to minimize the distance between symmetric modules. Such approaches are inefficient due to the large search space and cannot guarantee the closest proximity of symmetry modules. In this paper, we present the first linear-time-packing algorithm for the placement with symmetry constraints using the topological floorplan representations. We first introduce the concept of a symmetry island which is formed by modules of the same symmetry group in a single connected placement. Based on this concept and the B*-tree representation, we propose automatically symmetric-feasible (ASF) B*-trees to directly model the placement of a symmetry island. We then present hierarchical B*-trees (HB*-trees) which can simultaneously optimize the placement with both symmetry islands and nonsymmetric modules. Unlike the previous works, our approach can place the symmetry modules in a symmetry group in close proximity and significantly reduce the search space based on the symmetry-island formulation. In particular, the packing time for an ASF-B*-tree or an HB*-tree is the same as that for a plain B*-tree (only linear) and much faster than previous works. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the best-published quality and runtime efficiency for analog placement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4957591/04957593.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2017433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2017433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Placement Based on Symmetry-Island Formulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Cost function","Runtime","Voltage","Degradation","Design automation","Coupling circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetry-island formulation","linear-time-packing algorithm","topological floorplan representations","B*-tree representation","automatically symmetric-feasible B*-trees","symmetry islands","nonsymmetric modules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog circuit","floorplanning","physical design","placement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analog Placement Based on Symmetry-Island Formulation","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4957593/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664053","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Placement Based on Symmetry-Island Formulation","sourcePdf":"tcad-chang-2017433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083476S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4957591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4957591","articleId":"4957593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957599,"authors":[{"name":"Zyad Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4957591/4957599/4957599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zyad Hassan (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and electrical communications from Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2006.

Increasing power densities are making this problem more important. Characterizing the thermal profile of an IC quickly enough to allow feedback on the thermal effects of tentative design changes is a daunting problem, and its complexity is increasing. The move to nanometer-scale fabrication processes is increasing the importance of thermal phenomena such as ballistic phonon transport. The accurate thermal analysis of nanometer-scale ICs containing hundreds of millions of devices requires characterization of heat transport across multiple length scales. These scales range from the nanometer scale (device-level impact) to the centimeter scale (cooling package impact). Existing chip-package thermal analysis methods based on classical Fourier heat transfer cannot capture nanometer-scale thermal effects. However, accurate device-level modeling techniques, such as molecular dynamics methods, are far too slow for use in full-chip IC thermal analysis. In this paper, we propose and develop ThermalScope, a multiscale thermal analysis method for nanometer-scale IC design. It unifies microscopic and macroscopic thermal modeling methods, i.e., the Boltzmann transport equation and Fourier modeling methods. Moreover, it supports adaptive multiresolution modeling. Together, these ideas enable the efficient and accurate characterization of nanometer-scale heat transport as well as the chip-package-level heat flow. ThermalScope is designed for full-chip thermal analysis of billion-transistor nanometer-scale IC designs, with accuracy at the scale of individual devices. ThermalScope enables the accurate characterization of various temperature-related effects, such as temperature-dependent leakage power and temperature-timing dependences. ThermalScope has been implemented in software and used for the full-chip thermal analysis and temperature-dependent leakage analysis of an IC design with more than 150 million transistors. ThermalScope will be publicly released for free academic and personal use.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanoscale devices","Integrated circuit modeling","Circuit analysis","Integrated circuit reliability","Feedback","Fabrication","Phonons","Cooling","Packaging","Heat transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","nanotechnology","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale thermal analysis","nanometer scale integrated circuits","reliable high performance","cost effective integrated circuits","device level impact","cooling package impact","ThermalScope"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated-circuit (IC) thermal factors","leakage-power estimation","nanoscale heat flow","simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957599","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2017428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4957591/04957599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2017428","startPage":"860","endPage":"873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Thermal Analysis for Nanometer-Scale Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Thermal Analysis for Nanometer-Scale Integrated Circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957599/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","volume":"28","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4957599/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664060","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Thermal Analysis for Nanometer-Scale Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcad-shang-2017428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109095S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4957591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4957591","articleId":"4957599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4957626,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Conti","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy","WiLAB, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Andrea Conti (S'99\u2013M'01) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and computer science from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2001.","From 1999 to 2002, he was with the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni (CNIT), University of Bologna, and in November 2002, he joined the Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell\u00d5Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni, National Research Council, Research Unit of Bologna (IEIIT-BO/CNR).

We propose an analytical framework based on the log-concavity property of the EP which we prove for a wide family of multidimensional modulation formats in the presence of Gaussian disturbances and fading. Based on this property, we construct a class of local bounds for the EP that improve known generic bounds in a given region of the SNR and are invertible, as well as easily tractable for further analysis. This concept is motivated by the fact that communication systems often operate with performance in a certain region of interest (ROI) and, thus, it may be advantageous to have tighter bounds within this region instead of generic bounds valid for all SNRs. We present a possible application of these local bounds, but their relevance is beyond the example made in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4957623/04957626.pdf","startPage":"2766","endPage":"2775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2018273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2018273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957623","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Log-Concavity Property of the Error Probability With Application to Local Bounds for Wireless Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Wireless communication","Fading","AWGN","Mathematics","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Signal design","Multidimensional systems","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["log-concavity property","error probability","digital wireless communication","multidimensional modulation","Gaussian disturbances","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error statistics","fading channels","local bounds","log-concavity","performance evaluation","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Log-Concavity Property of the Error Probability With Application to Local Bounds for Wireless Communications","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4957626/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664352","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Log-Concavity Property of the Error Probability With Application to Local Bounds for Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"55tit06-aconti-2018273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135483S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957627,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Jim\u00c9nez Feltstrom","affiliation":["Department of System Architecture, Parc Tecnologic, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Alberto Jim\u00e9nez Feltstr\u00f6m (M'08) was born in M\u00e1laga, Spain, on June 28, 1964.

The mismatched decoding model is well defined for finite, yet arbitrary, block lengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging to the same symbol. We give two independent proofs of the achievability of the BICM capacity calculated by Caire \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">al.</i>\n, where BICM was modeled as a set of independent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwise log-likelihood ratio. Our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, and shows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is not required. The second proof is based on the random coding error exponents with mismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalized mutual information. Moreover, the generalized mutual information of the mismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver BICM capacity. We show that the error exponent-and hence the cutoff rate-of the BICM mismatched decoder is upper-bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus be lower than in the infinite-interleaved model; for binary reflected Gray mapping in Gaussian channels the loss in error exponent is small. We also consider the mutual information appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of BICM with extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts: if the symbol metric has knowledge of the transmitted symbol, EXIT mutual information admits a representation as a pseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable. A different symbol decoding metric, for which the extrinsic side information refers to the hypothesized symbol, induces a generalized mutual information lower than the coded modulation capacity. In this case, perfect extrinsic side information turns the mismatched-decoder error exponent into that of coded modulation.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2018177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4957623/04957628.pdf","startPage":"2756","endPage":"2765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2018177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation Revisited: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation Revisited: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957628/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10664358","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957628/","volume":"55","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation Revisited: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective","sourcePdf":"55tit06-amartinez-2018177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075504S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4957630,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Karmakar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Science Engineering Department, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sanjay Karmakar (S'08) received the Bachelor's degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2003.

The maximum rate of the DSD STBCs from QODs reported in the literature is \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[(a</i>\n)/(2\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n-1)] which is smaller than the rate \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[(a</i>\n-1)/(2\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n-2)] of the DSD codes of this paper, for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2a</i>\n transmit antennas. In particular, the reported DSD codes for 8 and 16 transmit antennas offer rates \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/4</i>\n , respectively, whereas the known STBCs from QODs offer only \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/4</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</i>\n, respectively. The construction of this paper is applicable for any number of transmit antennas. The diversity sum and diversity product of the new DSD codes are studied. It is shown that the diversity sum is larger than that of all known QODs and hence the new codes perform better than the comparable QODs at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for identical spectral efficiency. Simulation results for DSD codes at various spectral efficiencies are provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957630/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664359","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Rate, Multisymbol-Decodable STBCs From Clifford Algebras","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Rate, Multisymbol-Decodable STBCs From Clifford Algebras","sourcePdf":"55tit06-brajan-2018172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138787S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957637,"authors":[{"name":"David Poulin","affiliation":["Center of the Physics of Information, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","D\u00e9partement of Physique, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Sherbrooke, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["David Poulin received the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2004.","He has been a Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, in 2005 and at California Institute of Technology during 2006\u20132008.

Our construction offers several advantages over quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. First, the Tanner graph used for decoding is free of 4-cycles that deteriorate the performances of iterative decoding. Second, the iterative decoder makes explicit use of the code's degeneracy. Finally, there is complete freedom in the code design in terms of length, rate, memory size, and interleaver choice. We define a quantum analogue of a state diagram that provides an efficient way to verify the properties of a quantum convolutional code, and in particular, its recursiveness and the presence of catastrophic error propagation. We prove that all recursive quantum convolutional encoders have catastrophic error propagation. In our constructions, the convolutional codes have thus been chosen to be noncatastrophic and nonrecursive. While the resulting families of turbo codes have bounded minimum distance, from a pragmatic point of view, the effective minimum distances of the codes that we have simulated are large enough not to degrade the iterative decoding performance up to reasonable word error rates and block sizes. With well-chosen constituent convolutional codes, we observe an important reduction of the word error rate as the code length increases.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2018339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2018339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4957623/04957637.pdf","startPage":"2776","endPage":"2798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Serial Turbo Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Serial Turbo Codes","volume":"55","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957637/","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664385","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957637/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Serial Turbo Codes","sourcePdf":"55tit06-dpoulin-2018339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199779S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4957640,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Pad","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI) and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Pedram Pad (S'03) was born in Iran in 1986.","He is a double major B.S. degree student of electrical engineering and pure mathematics at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

This paper demonstrates that the number of iterations which is required for successful message-passing decoding scales at least like the inverse of the gap (in rate) to capacity, provided that the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes of these turbo-like ensembles does not vanish (hence, the number of iterations becomes unbounded as the gap to capacity vanishes).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds on the Number of Iterations for Turbo-Like Ensembles Over the Binary Erasure Channel","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2018342","startPage":"2602","endPage":"2617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2018342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4957623/04957644.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on the Number of Iterations for Turbo-Like Ensembles Over the Binary Erasure Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4957644/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664360","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on the Number of Iterations for Turbo-Like Ensembles Over the Binary Erasure Channel","sourcePdf":"55tit06-isason-2018342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077774S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957647,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

The new method has lower decoding complexity than the original method. The most basic form of the new method applies to any parity-check code structure, but is limited to a rather small number of packets in the code. Decoding success is slightly inferior to an ideal erasure channel, which would require sequence numbering and error detection in each packet. Error detection is needed only for the whole code, amounting to usually less than one bit per packet symbol. Moreover, if error detection can resolve one of a small number of alternatives, the ordered case performs almost as well as the ideal erasure channel. Ways are shown to modify the basic algorithm for use with long codes, possibly approaching the erasure channel capacity limit.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4957623/04957647.pdf","startPage":"2626","endPage":"2639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplification of Packet-Symbol Decoding With Errors, Deletions, Misordering of Packets, and No Sequence Numbers","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2018226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2018226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Simplification of Packet-Symbol Decoding With Errors, Deletions, Misordering of Packets, and No Sequence Numbers","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664372","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4957647/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplification of Packet-Symbol Decoding With Errors, Deletions, Misordering of Packets, and No Sequence Numbers","sourcePdf":"55tit06-jmetzner-2018226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115113S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957648,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00das Navarro-Moreno","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of Ja\u00e9n, Jaen, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Jes\u00fas Navarro-Moreno was born in Ja\u00e9n, Spain, in 1970.

The only allowed charge-placement mechanism is a ldquopush-to-the-toprdquo operation, which takes a single cell of the set and makes it the top-charged cell. The resulting scheme eliminates the need for discrete cell levels, as well as overshoot errors, when programming cells. We present unrestricted Gray codes spanning all possible n-cell states and using only \"push-to-the-top\" operations, and also construct balanced Gray codes.

These failures can cause the large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of message-passing iterative decoding to be worse than that predicted by the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding union bound. In this paper, we address the pseudocodeword problem from the convolutional code perspective. In particular, we compare the performance of LDPC convolutional codes with that of their \"wrapped\" quasi-cyclic block versions and we show that the minimum pseudoweight of an LDPC convolutional code is at least as large as the minimum pseudoweight of an underlying quasi-cyclic code. This result, which parallels a well-known relationship between the minimum Hamming weight of convolutional codes and the minimum Hamming weight of their quasi-cyclic counterparts, is due to the fact that every pseudocodeword in the convolutional code induces a pseudocodeword in the block code with pseudoweight no larger than that of the convolutional code's pseudocodeword. This difference in the weight spectra leads to improved performance at low-to-moderate SNRs for the convolutional code, a conclusion supported by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2018347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4957623/04957655.pdf","startPage":"2577","endPage":"2598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2018347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudocodeword Performance Analysis for LDPC Convolutional Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Pseudocodeword Performance Analysis for LDPC Convolutional Codes","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10664376","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudocodeword Performance Analysis for LDPC Convolutional Codes","sourcePdf":"55tit06-rsmarandache-2018347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064815S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4957655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4957657,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tie Liu (S'99\u2013M'06) received the B.S.

It is assumed that every node in the network has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol is used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form a beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers according to the channel strength information. For networks with no direct link, an algorithm is proposed to analytically find the exact solution with linear (in network size) complexity. It is shown that the transmitter should always use its maximal power while the optimal power of a relay ca.n take any value between zero and its maxima. Also, this value depends on the quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own. Despite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with the aid of a low-rate receiver broadcast, a relay needs only its own channel information to implement the optimal power control. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct link is considered. When the direct link exists during the first step only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no direct link. For networks with a direct link during the second step only and both steps, recursive numerical algorithms are proposed. Simulation shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity order and outperforms other existing schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957661/","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4957661/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10664379","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Network Beamforming Using Relays With Perfect Channel Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Beamforming Using Relays With Perfect Channel Information","sourcePdf":"55tit06-yjing-2018175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109086S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4957623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"309","xplore-issue":"4957623","articleId":"4957661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4957663,"authors":[{"name":"Youngchul Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Youngchul Sung (S'92\u2013M'93\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1993 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2005.","From 2005 until 2007, he worked as a Senior engineer in the Corporate R & D Center at Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA.

Nondestructive test for the steam generator tube, eddy current testing (ECT) method has been carried out. In case of bobbin-type ECT probe, transverse defect, defect with ferro-phase, outside of tube having ferrite sludge were very difficult to detect. To overcome these problems, a motorized rotating probe coil (MRPC) probe was developed but scan speed is slow and not effective method in time. In this work we have developed a new sensor having U-shape of yoke to measure permeability variation of test specimen, which can detect ferro-phase generated as well as normal defects in the tube material of Inconel 6oo. Electronics for signal processing, 2-phase lock-in amplifier per sensor, ADC, and embedded controller were employed in one probe and measured digital data were transmitted to the PC data acquisition software using RS232C interface. Using the developed sensors we have applied to detect defects in the tube outside with ferrite sludge which is very difficult to detect conventional bobbin-type ECT probe. Developed sensor could measure defect size of 0.2 mm times 10 mm times 0.44 mm (width times length times depth) for the normal defect and defect outside of tube having ferrite sludge.

Unlike conventional bearingless PM motors, such as a surface-mounted PM motor, a consequent-pole type of bearingless PM motor has inherent advantages. It can regulate the radial rotor positions independently of the motor drive and has no tradeoff between radial suspension force and torque. In the consequent-pole bearingless PM motors, distributed or concentrated windings can be employed to the motor winding structure. However, relationship between voltage characteristics and the winding design has not yet been revealed. In this paper, the induced electromotive force (EMF) of the consequent-pole bearingless PM motor is numerically calculated on the basis of the magnetic flux distribution in the airgap around the rotor. It is found that the EMF is distorted by the second harmonic at a specific slot number in a consequent-pole rotor. The calculated EMFs are confirmed with the experimental results in the fabricated test machines.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2018679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2018679","endPage":"2826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4957672/04957722.pdf","startPage":"2823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage Characteristics of a Consequent-Pole Bearingless PM Motor With Concentrated Windings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957722/","displayDocTitle":"Voltage Characteristics of a Consequent-Pole Bearingless PM Motor With Concentrated Windings","volume":"45","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10664476","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4957722/","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage Characteristics of a Consequent-Pole Bearingless PM Motor With Concentrated Windings","sourcePdf":"45tmag06-jasama-2018679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043336S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4957672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4957672","articleId":"4957722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4957732,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Gu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Gu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37635531200"},{"name":"Hyung-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Korea Railroad Research Institute, Uiwang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280119000"},{"name":"Sang-Hwan Ham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Hwan","lastName":"Ham","id":"37645182200"},{"name":"Chang-Sung Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang-Sung","lastName":"Jin","id":"37632626000"},{"name":"Hyun-June Park","affiliation":["Korea Railroad Research Institute, Uiwang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-June","lastName":"Park","id":"37595652300"},{"name":"Ju Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280315000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4957732","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":642},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Finite element methods","Pattern analysis","Current measurement","Cause effect analysis","Pollution measurement","Gears","Magnetic fields","Electromagnetic analysis","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","linear induction motors","plates (structures)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary reaction plate construction","linear induction motor","transverse edge effect","3D finite-element method","FEM analysis model","induced current pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Construction of secondary reaction plate","linear induction motor (LIM)","transverse edge effect","3-D finite-element method (FEM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, linear induction motor is analyzed by 3-D finite-element method (3-D FEM) to consider influence of construction of secondary reaction plate on the transverse edge effect.

Furthermore, the PM flux-switching linear motor has a potential for mass production at low cost, since the expensive coils and magnets are both set on the short mover. However, the detent force which is induced by both slot-effect and end-effect deteriorates the motor performance. Some methods to reduce detent force which are effective in PM linear synchronous motors do not work in PM flux-switching linear motors, due to their special structure. This paper describes a new method to reduce the detent force by fixing assistant teeth on the mover ends. Finite element analysis shows some interesting results which will be detailed in this paper.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Synchronous motors","Teeth","Costs","Finite element methods","Stator windings","Iron","Coils","Magnetic levitation","Rails"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","linear motors","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detent force reduction","permanent magnet flux-switching linear motor","PM flux-switching rotary machine","slot-effect deterioration","end-effect deterioration","finite element analysis","assistant iron teeth","PM linear synchronous motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detent force","finite element method (FEM)","flux-switching","linear motor","permanent magnet machine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2018689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4957672/04957757.pdf","startPage":"2843","endPage":"2846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2018689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for Reduction of Detent Force in Permanent Magnet Flux-Switching Linear Motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Method for Reduction of Detent Force in Permanent Magnet Flux-Switching Linear Motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957757/","volume":"45","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957757/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10664500","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for Reduction of Detent Force in Permanent Magnet Flux-Switching Linear Motors","sourcePdf":"45tmag06-mjin-2018689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039227S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4957672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4957672","articleId":"4957757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4957765,"authors":[{"name":"Pyungwoo Jang","affiliation":["Division of Applied Science, Cheongju University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Pyungwoo","lastName":"Jang","id":"37315515400"},{"name":"Bonghan Lee","affiliation":["Division of Applied Science, Cheongju University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bonghan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37579188000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4957765","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulation","Conductivity","Eddy currents","Powders","Magnetic cores","Soft magnetic materials","Iron","Permeability","Magnetic confinement","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","electrical resistivity","finite element analysis","iron","iron alloys","magnetic permeability","powder cores","silicon alloys","soft magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulator resistivity effects","insulation layer","eddy current loss","compressed powder cores","FEM","3D finite element method","permeability","microstructure","soft magnetic materials","FeSi","Fe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed powder cores","eddy current loss","FEM","resistivity"]}],"abstract":"Effects of the resistivity of the insulation layer on the eddy current loss of compressed Fe and Fe-6.5% Si powder cores were simulated by using 3-D finite element method.

The input data to the ANN were split into training data, testing data and validating data. Search were carried out to identify number of hidden layer and number of hidden nodes to find the best architecture with highest accuracy.

The chip-set for lowband (range 3.1-4.8 GHz) application has already been developed and UWB system for lowband has been evaluated by many companies. But the chip-set for full-band (range of 3.1-10.6 GHz) is on its developing stage. Therefore, various researches on the active devices like LNA, PA and the passives like filter, balun, antenna for full-band application are being performed vigorously [2], [3]. High electron mobility transistors(HEMTs) have played an important role in applications at millimeter wave ranges due to its high speed, low noise characteristics. Focusing on the low noise and high gain characteristics of the devices, applications at 3.1-10.6 GHz, utilizing pseudomorphic HEMT(pHEMT) has reported with excellent performance [4]. Motivated by this we have fabricated balanced low noise amplifier for UWB application utilizing metamorphic InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs(MHEMT) on GaAs substrate. For the wideband amplifier evaluation, the balanced amplifier with the broadband coupler was designed and realized using multilayer organic substrate based on the ceramic- polymer composite materials developed in this work.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4957916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4957916","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04957916.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ultrawideband low noise amplifier using metamorphic HEMT on organic substrate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A ultrawideband low noise amplifier using metamorphic HEMT on organic substrate","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957916/","accessionNumber":"10666637","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957916/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ultrawideband low noise amplifier using metamorphic HEMT on organic substrate","confLoc":"Macau","sourcePdf":"A1-53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040538S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4957916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4957922,"authors":[{"name":"Junfeng Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309894300"},{"name":"Wei Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hong","id":"37277098600"},{"name":"Zhenqi Kuai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenqi","lastName":"Kuai","id":"37318202800"},{"name":"Ke Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Poly-Grames Research Center, University of Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278659100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4957922","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Substrates","Antenna measurements","Millimeter wave technology","Slot antennas","Isolation technology","Millimeter wave communication","Mutual coupling","Linear antenna arrays","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","isolation technology","MIMO systems","printed circuits","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substrated integrated waveguide technology","multiple antennas","W-band","MIMO application","normal PCB process","compact structure","isolation feature"]}],"abstract":"Based on the substrate integrated waveguide technology, multiple antennas are developed at W-band for MIMO application.

The planar monopole was printed on an FR4 substrate and placed above a rectangular notch cut in a finite ground plane edge. By suitable separations of the patch from the left and right edges of the notch, two derived resonant modes are added to the lower band and upper bands respectively. Therefore, the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is significantly widened. In addition, the separation of the patch from the notch bottom edge obviously increases the input impedance in lower band, and shifts the operating band toward lower frequency.

However, its accuracy descends if the problems include dielectric material interfaces, in this case properly constructed averages of the media permittivities have been proposed, although those efforts increase the FDTD accuracy at the interfaces, the second-order accuracy is not really achieved because the uniform lattice is still employed in those efforts. The second-order accurate FDTD equations with nonuniform grids at dielectric interface have been presented in the work of Chu et al. (2002), and a good result was obtained at the magnetic material interface. The improved subgridding method has been proposed based on the traditional subgridding method by the introduction of the nonuniform grids and the application of the auxiliary magnetic fields to obtain the second order accuracy of the electric fields at the interface. But these methods can work only in the condition of planar interface, the case of dielectric surface still need to investigate. Q.H.Liu presented the ECT (enlarged cell technique) to solve the problem of the time reduction in the distortion grids in the conformal FDTD method. In this paper ECT is applied into the dielectric surface to improve the accuracy of the traditional staircase method. In the proposed method, the uniform grids are enlarged with some distance, and the enlarged distance is calculated by the Maxwell's equation and Taylor's series. The tangential electric fields at the interface can be obtained the second order accuracy. The numerical experiments are carried out to verify the better accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enlarged cell technique in FDTD method at the dielectric curved surface","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4957999","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04957999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4957999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4957999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4957999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Enlarged cell technique in FDTD method at the dielectric curved surface","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4957999/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10666669","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enlarged cell technique in FDTD method at the dielectric curved surface","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"A3-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034795S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4957999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4958040,"authors":[{"name":"Seong J.

The newly designed triplexer circuit was comprised of single diplexer, parallel resonant circuit, a BPF for GPS, and its impedance matching circuit. In comparison with previously reported triplexer circuit, it had much better performance characteristics and compact size, as expected. Most of simulated performance characteristic parameters were well matched with the measured ones. Since the fabricated triple-band/quad mode front-end module has good performance characteristics, small size/volume and low cost, it will be promising for US-CDMA handset applications. Their design and fabrication technologies will also be useful for advanced RF components and modules. In near future, on the basis of fabricated FEM, PCB embedded triple-band/quad mode FEM will be designed and demonstrated by using RF SOP technologies.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958040","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact triple band/quad mode front-end module for US-CDMA handset applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958040/","displayDocTitle":"Compact triple band/quad mode front-end module for US-CDMA handset applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10666829","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958040/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact triple band/quad mode front-end module for US-CDMA handset applications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"A4-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03505S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4958045,"authors":[{"name":"Erick E.

Experimental results were also presented. In our proposal, efficiency enhancements are achieved when the direct supply current decreases due to clipping in the drain current waveform after 2nd harmonic signal injection. In 2 GHz band experiments, it was confirmed that the direct drain current decreased by injecting a 2nd harmonic signal. The experiments also indicate that there are optimal amplitude and phase values for the injected 2nd harmonic signal which maximize the PA efficiency. As a result of optimizing the 2nd harmonic signal, 72.5 % maximum drain efficiency and 15.2 % efficiency improvement were obtained. In the future, we will investigate the principle of our proposed method in detail using waveform analyses.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958047","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958047.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-GHz band experiment on efficiency enhancement of a GaN power amplifier using 2nd harmonic injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 2-GHz band experiment on efficiency enhancement of a GaN power amplifier using 2nd harmonic injection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4958047/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10666676","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958047/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-GHz band experiment on efficiency enhancement of a GaN power amplifier using 2nd harmonic injection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"A4-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036698S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4958051,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewon Choi","affiliation":["Soongsil University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaewon Choi","id":"37087637386"},{"name":"Sunyoung Kim","affiliation":["Soongsil University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37089078442"},{"name":"Chulhun Seo","affiliation":["Soongsil University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chulhun Seo","id":"37087170213"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958051","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Impedance matching","Power system harmonics","Circuits","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Voltage","Frequency domain analysis","Energy consumption","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","power MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency power amplifier","harmonic control circuit","lateral depletion MOSFET","input-output matching network","second harmonics","third harmonics","power-added efficiency","frequency 1.71 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a high-efficiency PA using the novel harmonic control circuit is realized with Si LDMOSFET.

However, the deployment of multiple antennas requires the implementation of multiple RF chains that are generally expensive. A promising approach for reducing the implementation complexity, while retaining a reasonably good performance, is to employ some form of antenna selection.

Uncoded QPSK symbols were used and perfect synchronization was assumed. A more realistic assumption is to let the level of variation of the channel changes between fast and very slow. Six threshold levels of the Doppler spread have been chosen for the adaptive pilot arrangement. The simulation results in Fig. 2 show an increase in the bit rate when the channel is static or slowly varying. Whereas in the rapidly varying cases the bit rate falls down to the conventional one (24 Mbps). In Fig. 2 the bit rate has been averaged every 500 symbols. It was shown that the adaptive method increases the total capacity of the system. The gain in the throughput is noticeable for slow varying and static channels. We noticed that, by choosing proper threshold levels, the adaptive system is comparable in the BER performance with the conventional one.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958107.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive pilot distribution for OFDM systems in time-variant channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bandwidth","Doppler effect","Channel estimation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Phase shift keying","Frequency domain analysis","Microwave communication","Electromagnetic fields","Resists"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","time-varying channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive pilot distribution","OFDM systems","time-variant channels","uncoded QPSK symbols"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive pilot distribution for OFDM systems in time-variant channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958107/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10666849","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive pilot distribution for OFDM systems in time-variant channels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"A5-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044774S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4958108,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Liu","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406554700"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403440900"},{"name":"Marek E.

The receive antenna orientations do not affect the SLS and MMSE methods.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958108","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation into MIMO channel estimation performance under a double-bounce channel model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation into MIMO channel estimation performance under a double-bounce channel model","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958108/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10666850","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4958108/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation into MIMO channel estimation performance under a double-bounce channel model","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"A5-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056413S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4958114,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Ni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Ni","id":"37638060600"},{"name":"Falin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Falin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37419353400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958114","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Voltage","Linearity","Power transmission lines","Phase modulation","Amplitude modulation","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Information science","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance","impedance matching","load (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance match method","serial Chireix combiner","active load pulling","ADS software"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the impedances seen by each amplifier under the active load pulling in Chireix combiner.

When they interact with electromagnetic waves, exciting phenomena appear and amazing features result. In particular, characteristics such as frequency stop bands, pass bands, and band gaps could be identified. Reviewing the literature, one observes that various terminologies have been used depending on the domain of the applications. These applications are seen in filter designs, gratings, frequency selective surfaces (FSS), photonic crystals and photonic band-gaps (PBG), etc. We classify them under the broad terminology of \"electromagnetic band gap (EBG)\" structures. EBG structures have provided promising paradigm for novel antenna designs. Due to the complexity of the EBG structures, it is usually difficult to characterize them through purely analytical methods. Instead, full wave simulators that are based on advanced numerical methods have been used in EBG analysis. Dispersion diagram, surface impedance, and reflection phase features are revealed for different EBG structures. These analysis tools have been integrated with modern optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to synthesis unique EBG structures. The applications of EBG structures in antenna designs have become a thrilling topic for antenna scientists and engineers. This is the central focus of this presentation by initially reviewing the fundamentals and then demonstrating recent advances. Utilizing several representative antenna examples it will be demonstrated that proper utilizations of EBG structures could enhance the performance of low profile antennas; however, considerable care must be exercised to fully appreciate their advantages and disadvantages.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958195.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures in antenna engineering: From fundamentals to recent advances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Periodic structures","Metamaterials","Photonic band gap","Terminology","Frequency selective surfaces","Photonic crystals","Electromagnetic scattering","Band pass filters","Gratings","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","genetic algorithms","numerical analysis","particle swarm optimisation","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic band gap structures","antenna engineering","electromagnetic waves","filter designs","frequency selective surfaces","photonic crystals","photonic band-gaps","antenna designs","full wave simulators","numerical methods","dispersion diagram","surface impedance","reflection phase features","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures in antenna engineering: From fundamentals to recent advances","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958195/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10684210","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures in antenna engineering: From fundamentals to recent advances","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"A7-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030419S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4958250,"authors":[{"name":"Yandong Gong","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yandong","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888200"},{"name":"L.

We have also demonstrated the reconfigurability feature of the multi-tap filter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave filters","Erbium-doped fiber lasers","Masers","Optical fiber polarization","Optical fiber devices","Optical fiber filters","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical filters","Ring lasers","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","doping","erbium","fibre lasers","microwave filters","optical fibre filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitap microwave photonic filter","sampled-chirped fiber Bragg grating","multiwavelength erbium-doped fiber laser","near-Gaussian-profile multiwavelength distribution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958250","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958250.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-tap microwave photonic filter using a sampled-chirped fiber Bragg grating based multi-wavelength erbium-doped fiber laser","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-tap microwave photonic filter using a sampled-chirped fiber Bragg grating based multi-wavelength erbium-doped fiber laser","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958250/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958250/","accessionNumber":"10666953","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-tap microwave photonic filter using a sampled-chirped fiber Bragg grating based multi-wavelength erbium-doped fiber laser","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"B6-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038905S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4958262,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Lin Kuo","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jing-Lin","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37275496400"},{"name":"Zuo-Min Tsai","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zuo-Min","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37301805900"},{"name":"Kun-You Lin","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-You","lastName":"Lin","id":"37277928800"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958262","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958262","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","CMOS technology","High power amplifiers","Power generation","Gain","Solid state circuits","CMOS process","Circuit simulation","Power measurement","Wireless personal area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["V-band power amplifier","CMOS process","size 0.13 mum","frequency 55 GHz","gain 15.5 dB"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a V-band CMOS power amplifier fabricated using 0.13-mum CMOS process is presented with a maximum output power of 14.3 dBm and a PidB of 11.2 dBm at 55 GHz.

The simulation verified OPDFB linearization for two tones CW indirect modulation to optical fibre. This technique has investigated linearization for the SOA amplifier by an OPDFB linearizer to cancel out the third order inter-modulation distortion (IMD) or four waves mixing. In this paper, we have used two channels and have seen more than 20 dB reductions in the spectral re-growth caused by the SMF and SOA. Amplifier non-linearity becomes more severe with two strong input channels leading to inter-channel distortion which can completely mask a third adjacent channel. The simulations detailed above were performed utilizing optimum settings for the variable gain and phase components in the error correction loop of the OPDFB system and hence represent the ideal situation of a perfect OPDFB system. The results suggest that OPDFB linearization allows successful transmission of multiple channels in a wireless-over-fiber system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4958287/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10684265","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optical predistortion feedback linearization for suppressing the nonlinearity in optical amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical predistortion feedback linearization for suppressing the nonlinearity in optical amplifier","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"C2-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030584S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4958289,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Crespo-Cadenas","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Crespo-Cadenas","id":"38277012600"},{"name":"Javier Reina-Tosina","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Reina-Tosina","id":"38270445200"},{"name":"Maria J.

For example, the W-CDMA signal used in UMTS-standard has typical PAR levels above 6 dB. Conventional single-ended power amplifiers will result in low levels of average efficiency, if they were implemented in the transmitters of such communication systems. Furthermore, power control in cellular communication networks is a crucial requirement, in both, base station and handset transmitters, to reduce the operating cost on the base station side, and to minimize the adjacent-channel interference. It is though apparent, that power amplifiers in modern wireless communication networks, should operate over a wide output back off region, with high levels of efficiency, maintained over the power operating range.

It is to be noted that since the size of population and the number of iterations are considered to be the same, computation time for both techniques is almost identical.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958331","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958331.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of differential evolution and particle swarm optimization in one-dimensional reconstruction problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of differential evolution and particle swarm optimization in one-dimensional reconstruction problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10684293","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4958331/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of differential evolution and particle swarm optimization in one-dimensional reconstruction problems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"D1-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040317S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-12"},{"_id":4958349,"authors":[{"name":"Yoichi Kawano","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Kawano","id":"37264869200"},{"name":"Toshihide Suzuki","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihide","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37276138000"},{"name":"Masaru Sato","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"Sato","id":"37290041100"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Nakasha","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Nakasha","id":"37283934700"},{"name":"Tatsuya Hirose","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37267175800"},{"name":"Naoki Hara","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Hara","id":"37321156900"},{"name":"Kazukiyo Joshin","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazukiyo","lastName":"Joshin","id":"37266834300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958349","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Millimeter wave technology","Gain","Power generation","Circuits","Impedance","Millimeter wave transistors","Microwave devices","Costs","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","elemental semiconductors","field effect MMIC","integrated circuit design","MMIC power amplifiers","nanoelectronics","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudo-differential power amplifier design","CMOS process","two-stage cascode configuration","off-chip transformer","amplifier fabrication","frequency 20 GHz","size 90 nm","gain 18 dB","voltage 2.4 V","Si"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958349","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958349.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"20-GHz, 20-dBm pseudo-differential power amplifier in standard 90-nm CMOS","abstract":"This paper presents a 20-GHz pseudo-differential power amplifier (PA) fabricated in a standard 90-nm Si-CMOS process.

The MPA is a two-stage single-ended design which employs a simple RC feedback amplifier. Feedback is an important concept in circuit design, where a signal or voltage derived from the output is superimposed on the input. This output-to-input path can be used for several purposes such as to control output voltage, control gain, reduce distortion, improve stability, or create instability, as in an oscillator. The RC feedback that was used in this MPA design is to linearize the stages as well as to improve the circuit stability and increases the bandwidth. The performance of the proposed amplifier in this paper will be discussed in terms of stability, gain, power-added efficiency (PAE), and output

Since a few rays are traced in each iteration, high resolution can be achieved within acceptable amount of time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new ray tracing acceleration technique based on decomposition of wavefronts","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958488","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new ray tracing acceleration technique based on decomposition of wavefronts","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958488/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10667015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new ray tracing acceleration technique based on decomposition of wavefronts","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"F4-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053311S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4958491,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Dan Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Dan","lastName":"Kong","id":"37573006500"},{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Xin","lastName":"Chu","id":"37285768100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958491","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Time domain analysis","Equations","Matrix decomposition","Symmetric matrices","Coplanar waveguides","Two dimensional displays","Propagation losses","Permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","matrix algebra","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-order accuracy","Maxwell matrix","ADI-FDTD method","SSCN6-FDTD method","cell per wavelength","numerical anisotropic error"]}],"abstract":"A new unconditionally-stable FDTD method based on split-step scheme with high-order accuracy and low anisotropy has been presented, in which symmetric operator and uniform splitting are adopted to decompose the Maxwell's matrix into six sub-matrices, and accordingly, six sub-steps is produced.

The motivation behind the research of the methods was utilize their good interpolation features and straightward computation. Based on Galerkin's method our algorithms are applied to the second-order vector wave equation form of Maxwell's equations. Section 2 and 3 started with a short review of the derivation of time-domain finite element methods formulation and obtained fully discretized systems with the aforementioned temporal basis functions in order to match stable conditions. Finally, numerical results demonstrated the validity of the novel methods. Because Sierpinski fractal antennas have potential application to ultrawide-band (UWB) communications, the new methods were applied to a multiband bowtie-shaped Sierpinski antenna and comparison with the single bowtie antenna through time domain and frequent domain FEM simulation shown that the bowtie-shaped Sierpinski antenna performed better than the conventional bowtie for UWB purposes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Several novel TDFEMs based on different temporal basis functions and applications of UWB antennas","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958498","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958498.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Several novel TDFEMs based on different temporal basis functions and applications of UWB antennas","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958498/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10684320","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Several novel TDFEMs based on different temporal basis functions and applications of UWB antennas","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"F6-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051881S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4958502,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Jian Liu","affiliation":["Lab on Wireless Communication and EMC, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecom, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yuan Jian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087203638"},{"name":"Wu Dong","affiliation":["Lab on Wireless Communication and EMC, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecom, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37087204184"},{"name":"Ye Rong Zhang","affiliation":["Lab on Wireless Communication and EMC, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecom, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Ye Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087204278"},{"name":"Cao Wei","affiliation":["Lab on Wireless Communication and EMC, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Cao","lastName":"Wei","id":"37087201428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958502","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Ray tracing","Indoor environments","Radio propagation","Predictive models","Wireless communication","Indoor radio communication","Multipath channels","Optical reflection","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","indoor radio","multipath channels","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain ray tracing","deterministic splitting method","ray tubes","radio propagation channels","complex indoor environments","indoor radio channel","frequency-domain","time-domain multipath channel model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we will propose a novel approach to the radio propagation channels in complex indoor environments firstly. This technique is called the deterministic splitting method of ray tubes(DSMRT). The DSMRT is optimized for predicting indoor radio channel which can overcome the drawback of the ADRTT. At the same time, the DSMRT has the merits of less CPU time and higher computing efficiency, compared with two known methods of ray tubes on the condition of same prediction precision in.Meanwhile ,the prediction of received power in frequency-domain has been done with this method in indoor environment. Secondly, we will apply DSMRT to time-domain prediction of radio propagation characteristics. It is well known that a time-domain multipath channel model is developed based on TD-UTD technique. We choose the same typical office environments as to model. A good agreement is achieved between the simulated results and the published results.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958502","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958502.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient method of time-domain ray tracing based on the deterministic splitting method of ray tubes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958502/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method of time-domain ray tracing based on the deterministic splitting method of ray tubes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10667024","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958502/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method of time-domain ray tracing based on the deterministic splitting method of ray tubes","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"F6-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088865S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4958510,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gang Wang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hao Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599282300"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Li Wang","id":"37311070800"},{"name":"Huan Li","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Huan Li","id":"37311295100"},{"name":"Hong Bing Song","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hong Bing Song","id":"37305425900"},{"name":"Kan Hong","affiliation":["University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Kan Hong","id":"37308146800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958510","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"abstract":"In this paper, the effects of the antenna shapes on the indoor MIMO channel capacity are analyzed based on a rigorous numerical model. Based on network theory, we first give the rigorous MIMO channel transfer function using the admittance matrices of the transmitter and receiver, and the admittance matrix between them. Consequently, we use the multilevel Green's function interpolation method (MLGFIM) to solve for the input admittance matrices and the radiation patterns of the transmitter and the receiver and employ the ray tracing method to obtain the mutual admittance matrix between the transmitter and the receiver. Using this procedure, we rigorously analyze the channel capacity of a newly devised MIMO array system, i. e. the 20-by-20 icosahedron array MIMO. We also compare this system with a 20-by-20 planar array MIMO and find that the icosahedron array MIMO system can gain high MIMO channel capacity than the 20-by-20 planar array MIMO with relatively small effective volume size. This kind of system is suitable for indoor wireless communication environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4913660/4957855/04958510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2008.4958510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2008.4958510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Numerical analysis of the antenna shapes effects on the indoor MIMO capacity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical analysis","Shape","MIMO","Admittance","Transmission line matrix methods","Channel capacity","Transmitters","Planar arrays","Numerical models","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","channel capacity","Green's function methods","interpolation","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","antenna shapes effects","indoor MIMO channel capacity","multilevel Green's function interpolation method","network theory","transmitter","receiver","channel transfer function","antenna radiation patterns","mutual admittance matrix","icosahedron antenna array","planar antenna array","indoor wireless communication environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Numerical analysis of the antenna shapes effects on the indoor MIMO capacity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4958510/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10684329","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Numerical analysis of the antenna shapes effects on the indoor MIMO capacity","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"G1-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037451S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4958529,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Jianwu","affiliation":["Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Jianwu","id":"37448548200"},{"name":"Zhou Yangyang","affiliation":["Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Yangyang","id":"37642943800"},{"name":"Wang Yuting","affiliation":["Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Wang Yuting","id":"37642943000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2641-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2642-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"4958529","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"This paper addresses the issues by introducing a low-profile diversity antenna which resonates at 2 GHz with the patch size of 43mmx40mm, it has a great reduction compared with the size (70mmx50mm) of antenna.

In this case, objects can have different characteristics. We propose a thorough study of the energy consumption, taking into account efficiencies of the transmitter and relays. Given a quality of service, we minimize the global consumption and evaluate the impact of the relays' characteristics. If efficiency (source and relay) and noise level (relay and destination) are equal, the multihop transmission is less power effective than the direct link. However, the dissipated energy is shared by the different objects involved in the transmission which can result in a longer lifetime of the network. Besides, a disparity in the objects' parameters can result in important changes in the dissipated power. In section I we present the source, relays and destination characteristics. We derive the optimal solution to save energy given a signal to noise ratio at the receiver. In section II we evaluate the interest of multihop non-regenerative relaying and the impact of efficiency on consumption. The dual-hops link is analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4958648/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10666910","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact of material parameters on the energy consumption for amplify and forward relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of material parameters on the energy consumption for amplify and forward relays","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"J1-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035106S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4913660","isNumber":"4957855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4913660","xplore-issue":"4957855","articleId":"4958648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4958740,"authors":[{"name":"Qingsong Shi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Qingsong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37289345000"},{"name":"Lingxiang Xiang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Lingxiang","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37639353100"},{"name":"Tianzhou Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Tianzhou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290411700"},{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37288604400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3557-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3581-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4958740","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded system","Hardware","Embedded software","Computer architecture","Linux","Operating systems","File systems","Computer science education","Educational institutions","Educational technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science education","educational courses","electronic engineering education","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","system-on-chip","teaching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based SOC embedded system education","teaching course model","ARM architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","embedded system","course model","embedded education"]}],"abstract":"The wide application of embedded systems becomes a trend in the post-PC era.

Numerous researchers employed these features to study the utilization of machine learning for intrusion detection and reported detection rates up to 91% with false positive rates less than 1%.

We reduced the number of inputs while keeping IDS systems high detection rates. After simulation, analysis and experiment, we reduce the input number to 18, get a ldquobestrdquo architecture, i.e. 18-36-1, of BP neural network for IDS systems. Furthermore, we find an appropriate training function, i.e. train bfg, for our ldquobestrdquo architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ETCS.2009.102","startPage":"418","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETCS.2009.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4958703","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/4958702/4958703/04958805.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4958805/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4958805/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10686192","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"7-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3557a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032333S","chronDate":"7-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4958702","isNumber":"4958703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4958702","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4958703","articleId":"4958805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4958811,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Lianshuan","affiliation":["Computer Department, State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis of Industrial Equipment, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Lianshuan","id":"37643104800"},{"name":"Yuan Liang","affiliation":["Computer Department, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37630475600"},{"name":"Li Zengyan","affiliation":["Computer Department, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zengyan","id":"37643105900"},{"name":"Dai Yi","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, Tianjin, CN"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Yi","id":"37408723600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3557-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3581-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4958811","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4958811","abstract":"The genetic algorithm is used to solve the multi-objective networks design problem that requires selecting a best route to make a balance with cost and delay of the route.

de-noising method based on wavelet transform is presented based on the good localization characteristic of the wavelet transform both in time and frequency domain, which can make happen the extraction of visual evoked potentials in single training sample from the EEG background noise in favor of studying the changes between the single sample response. The information is probably related with the different function, appearance and pathologies of the brain. At the same time this method can also be used to remove those signal's artifacts that do not appear with EP within the same scope of time or frequency. The traditional Fourier filter can hardly attain the similar result. This method is different from other wavelet de-noising methods in that different criteria are employed in choosing wavelet coefficient. It has a biggest virtue of noting the differences among the single training sample and making use of the characteristics of being high time frequency resolution to reduce the effect of interference factors to a maximum extent within the time scope that EP appear. The experiment result proves that this method is not restricted by the signal-to-noise ratio of evoked potential and electroencephalograph and even can recognize instantaneous event under the condition of lower signal-to-noise ratio, as well as recognize more easily the samples, which evoked evident response. In addition, averaging methodology can dramatically reduce the number of record samples needed, thus avoiding the effect of behavior change during the recording process. This methodology pays attention to the differences among single training sample and also accomplishes the extraction of visual evoked potentials from single trainings sample. As a result, system speed and accuracy could be improved to a great extent if this methodology is applied to brain-computer interface system based on evoked responses.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

The traditional methods solving it have their own Advantages and shortcomings. The powerful information processing capabilities of immune system provides people enlightenment for its artificial application. As a result, immune algorithm has emerged, and gradually been applied to many engineering practices. Due to the stubborn nature of the JSP, a new method based on immune particle swarm algorithm (IPA) is initially brought forward to solve job-shop scheduling problem.

Efficient coding and compression techniques are required to meet the QoS (Quality of Service) requirements of such services. H.264, the latest coding and compression standard from ITU-T, is currently dominating the field by offering a flexible architecture and compression gain of up to 50%. In H.264, intra frame prediction is conducted in the spatial domain. There are two types of intra prediction for luma-Intra_16times16 and Intra_4times4. Four and nine modes are supported respectively. The complexity and computation load increase drastically. A fast mode decision algorithm for H.264 intra prediction is presented in this paper. The algorithm predicts every macroblock using macroblock features before coding, then selects parts of the prediction modes. Experimental results show that the proposed fast algorithm can achieve 30% to 60% computation reduction while maintaining similar PSNR and bit rate performance of H.264 encoder.","doi":"10.1109/ETCS.2009.434","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/4958702/4958969/04959148.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETCS.2009.434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4958969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Intra Prediction Algorithm for H.264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Intra Prediction Algorithm for H.264","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4959148/","accessionNumber":"10686515","volume":"2","publicationDate":"March 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Intra Prediction Algorithm for H.264","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3557c772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057595S","chronDate":"7-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4958702","isNumber":"4958969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4958702","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4958969","articleId":"4959148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959189,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-han Guan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-han","lastName":"Guan","id":"37289802800"},{"name":"Meng-meng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meng-meng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406626500"},{"name":"Yong Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, North-China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37635435000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3557-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3581-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4959189","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Education","Educational technology","Paper technology","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Educational institutions","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","computer science education","educational courses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Matlab simulation","signals","systems","data structure","teaching method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matlab simulation","signals and systems","application at different levels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959189","abstract":"This paper describes the simulation by Matlab in the course of signals and systems.

Firstly, in order to obtain the sub-band multi-wavelet coefficients, two multi-focus images are transformed by multi-wavelet. Then, the regional gradients of high-frequency sub-bands at the largest scale are calculated. Finally, the high-frequency multi-wavelet coefficients and low-frequency multi-wavelet coefficients of the fusion image are determined simultaneously by the principle which is called the direction consistency of regional gradients. This algorithm can avoid the inconsistency that the fusion multi-wavelet coefficients at the same point are extracted from the source image A in the horizontal direction, and from the source image B in the vertical direction.

Recently, many sparse source separation approaches with time-frequency masks have been proposed. However, most of these approaches require information on the number of sources in advance. In our proposed method, we model the histogram of the estimated direction of arrival (DOA) with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a Dirichlet prior. Then we estimate the model parameters by using the maximum a posteriori estimation based on the EM algorithm. In order to avoid one cluster being modeled by two or more Gaussians, we utilize a sparse distribution modeled by the Dirichlet distributions as the prior of the GMM mixture weight. By using this prior, without any specific model selection process, our proposed method can estimate the number of sources and time-frequency masks simultaneously. Experimental results show the performance of our proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959513.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind sparse source separation for unknown number of sources using Gaussian mixture model fitting with Dirichlet prior","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Time frequency analysis","Histograms","Direction of arrival estimation","Clustering algorithms","Speech","Parameter estimation","Maximum a posteriori estimation","Blind source separation","Independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","direction-of-arrival estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian distribution","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind sparse source separation","Gaussian mixture model fitting","Dirichlet distribution","histogram","direction-of-arrival estimation","maximum a posteriori estimation","EM algorithm","time-frequency masks","GMM mixture weight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation","Dirichlet distribution","prior","number of sources","sparse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind sparse source separation for unknown number of sources using Gaussian mixture model fitting with Dirichlet prior","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701325","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind sparse source separation for unknown number of sources using Gaussian mixture model fitting with Dirichlet prior","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055467S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959515,"authors":[{"name":"Banu Gunel","affiliation":["I-Lab/CCSR, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Banu","lastName":"Gunel","id":"37587061600"},{"name":"Huseyin Hacihabiboglu","affiliation":["King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Hacihabiboglu","id":"38228977100"},{"name":"Ahmet M.

While only a four-element compact sensor array is used, multiple channels for all possible source directions are produced by exhaustive separation. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is then applied to determine the signal subspace and the directions of the local maxima of the signal energy. This information is then used to select the channels containing the individual sources. While the original IVDE method requires the prior knowledge of the directions of sources for separation, the present method eliminates this need and achieves fully blind separation. Performing SVD at a post-processing stage also improves the sound quality.

The proposed system models each fall or noise segment by means of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) supervector, whose Euclidean distance measures the pairwise difference between audio segments. A support vector machine built on a kernel between GMM supervectors is employed to classify audio segments into falls and various types of noise. Experiments on a dataset of human falls, collected as part of the Netcarity project, show that the method improves fall classification F-score to 67% from 59% of a baseline GMM classifier. The approach also effectively addresses the more difficult fall detection problem, where audio segment boundaries are unknown. Specifically, we employ it to reclassify confusable segments produced by a dynamic programming scheme based on traditional GMMs. Such post-processing improves a fall detection accuracy metric by 5% relative.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959522","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959522.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic fall detection using Gaussian mixture models and GMM supervectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959522/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic fall detection using Gaussian mixture models and GMM supervectors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701407","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959522/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic fall detection using Gaussian mixture models and GMM supervectors","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078771S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4959524,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin Mabande","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Mabande","id":"37645329100"},{"name":"Adrian Schad","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Schad","id":"37645329400"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959524","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":949},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Sensor phenomena and characterization","White noise","Noise robustness","Array signal processing","Frequency","Gain measurement","Noise measurement","Wavelength measurement","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convex programming","error analysis","least squares approximations","quadratic programming","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust superdirective beamformers","convex optimization problem","broadband data-independent beamforming design","white noise gain","error analysis","least-squares beamformer design","sequential quadratic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Superdirective Beamformer","White Noise Gain","Sequential Quadratic Programming"]}],"abstract":"Broadband data-independent beamforming designs aiming at constant beamwidth often lead to superdirective beamformers for low frequencies, if the sensor spacing is small relative to the wavelengths. Superdirective beamformers are extremely sensitive to spatially white noise and to small errors in the array characteristics. These errors are nearly uncorrelated from sensor to sensor and affect the beamformer in a manner similar to spatially white noise. Hence the White Noise Gain (WNG) is a commonly used measure for the robustness of beamformer designs. In this paper, we present a method which incorporates a constraint for the WNG into a least-squares beamformer design and still leads to a convex optimization problem that can be solved directly, e.g. by sequential quadratic programming. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by design examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959524","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of robust superdirective beamformers as a convex optimization problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of robust superdirective beamformers as a convex optimization problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959524/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701409","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4959524/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of robust superdirective beamformers as a convex optimization problem","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071046S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959531,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Louis Durrieu","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Louis","lastName":"Durrieu","id":"37396482000"},{"name":"Gael Richard","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Gael","lastName":"Richard","id":"37284977100"},{"name":"Bertrand David","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"David","id":"37284977700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959531","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":243},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative approach to monaural musical mixture de-soloing","abstract":"In this article, we introduce a novel approach for monaural source separation with the specific aim to separate a polyphonic musical recording into two main sources: a main instrument (or melody) track and an accompaniment track. To that aim, we propose to model the power spectral densities (PSDs) of both contributions with a source/filter model for the main instrument while retaining a model emphasizing temporal repetitions of the musical background. We show that improved source separation performances can be obtained by a two-step estimation strategy where the model parameters are re-estimated in a second stage by adequately exploiting the main melody line estimated in a first stage.

The challenge of BSS for moving sources is that the mixing filters are time varying, thus the unmixing filters should also be time varying, which are difficult to track in real time. In the proposed approach, the visual modality is utilized to facilitate the separation for both stationary and moving sources. The movement of the sources is detected by a 3-D tracker based on particle filtering. The full BSS solution is formed by integrating a frequency domain blind source separation algorithm and beamforming: if the sources are identified as stationary, a frequency domain BSS algorithm is implemented with an initialization derived from the visual information. Once the sources are moving, a beamforming algorithm is used to perform real time speech enhancement and provide separation of the sources. Experimental results show that by utilizing the visual modality, the proposed algorithm can not only improve the performance of the BSS algorithm and mitigate the permutation problem for stationary sources, but also provide a good BSS performance for moving sources in a low reverberant environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959536.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal blind source separation for moving sources","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Array signal processing","Frequency domain analysis","Cameras","Filters","Particle tracking","Filtering","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimodal blind source separation","moving sources","mixing filter","visual modality","3D tracker","particle filtering","frequency domain blind source separation algorithm","beamforming algorithm","real time speech enhancement","permutation problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BSS","multimodal signal processing","particle filtering","3-D tracking","beamforming","FastICA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal blind source separation for moving sources","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701421","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal blind source separation for moving sources","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053757S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":4959554,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Qin Li","id":"37087147776"},{"name":"Wei-Ge Chen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Ge Chen","id":"37087184510"},{"name":"Chao He","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Chao He","id":"37087871649"},{"name":"Henrique S.

Our method explicitly includes a model for echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) as part of the optimization criteria. Convergence of the high-dimensional, nonlinear optimization problem is facilitated by decorrelating the prototype filter impulse response via a discreet cosine transform (DCT), discarding many insignificant coefficients and thus reducing the dimensionality of the search. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the effects on the performance of AEC, with ELRE improvements on the order of 3 dB or better.

Due to its efficiency, DirAC has already been proposed for spatial audio teleconferencing scenarios. Modern hands-free communication systems usually include beamforming techniques to improve speech intelligibility by suppressing diffuse background noise and interfering sources. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial filtering method which can be integrated into the DirAC spatial codec. It uses a spectral weighting of the recorded audio signal, where the design of the corresponding spatial filter transfer function is based on the DirAC parameters, i. e., direction-of-arrival and diffuseness of the sound field. Simulation results show that compared to a standard beamformer the novel technique offers significantly higher interference attenuation, while introducing similar distortion of the desired signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959559","startPage":"217","endPage":"220","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959559.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial filtering using directional audio coding parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatial filtering using directional audio coding parameters","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959559/","accessionNumber":"10701582","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959559/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial filtering using directional audio coding parameters","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055949S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4959563,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Lombard","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Lombard","id":"37590430000"},{"name":"Tobias Rosenkranz","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Rosenkranz","id":"37645250700"},{"name":"Herbert Buchner","affiliation":["Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Buchner","id":"37284667200"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959563","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Blind source separation","Source separation","Microphone arrays","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency","Acoustic sensors","Sensor arrays","Information filtering","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic radiators","blind source separation","microphone arrays","multidimensional signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional localization","multiple sound sources","averaged directivity patterns","blind source separation systems","acoustic source localization framework","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic source localization","blind source separation","microphone arrays"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a versatile acoustic source localization framework exploiting the self-steering capability of Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms.

Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in a reverberant environment for the localization of speech sources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional localization of multiple sound sources using averaged directivity patterns of Blind Source Separation systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959563","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959563.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional localization of multiple sound sources using averaged directivity patterns of Blind Source Separation systems","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959563/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701586","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional localization of multiple sound sources using averaged directivity patterns of Blind Source Separation systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055387S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959569,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Albu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, \"Politehnica\" University of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Albu","id":"37270884100"},{"name":"Yuriy Zakharov","affiliation":["University of York, Heslington, Yorkshire, UK"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Zakharov","id":"37271562300"},{"name":"Constantin Paleologu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, \"Politehnica\" University of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Paleologu","id":"37304184600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959569","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Projection algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Adaptive filters","Finite impulse response filter","Least squares approximation","Filtering algorithms","Active noise reduction","Control systems","Convergence","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","active noise control","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel filtered-x affine projection algorithm","dichotomous coordinate descent iterations","active noise control systems","recursive filtering","convergence properties","multichannel filtered-x LMS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive filters","adaptive signal processing","acoustic applications","least mean square methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959569","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959569.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified filtered-x dichotomous coordinate descent recursive affine projection algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new multichannel filtered-x affine projection algorithm based on dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) iterations for active noise control (ANC) systems.

We analyze event related multi-channel EEG recordings on the basis of the time-varying spectrum for each channel. It is a common approach to use wavelet transformations for the time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the data. To identify the signal components we decompose the data into time-frequency-space atoms using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. In this paper we show that a TFA based on the Wigner-Ville distribution together with the recently developed closed-form PARAFAC algorithm enhance the separability of the signal components. This renders it an attractive approach for processing EEG data. Additionally, we introduce the new concept of component amplitudes, which resolve the scaling ambiguity in the PARAFAC model and can be used to judge the relevance of the individual components.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959592","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959592.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-dimensional space-time-frequency component analysis of event related EEG data using closed-form PARAFAC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959592/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-dimensional space-time-frequency component analysis of event related EEG data using closed-form PARAFAC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701672","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959592/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-dimensional space-time-frequency component analysis of event related EEG data using closed-form PARAFAC","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095505S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4959603,"authors":[{"name":"Chenlu Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Chenlu Qiu","id":"37629477800"},{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Lu","id":"37404586100"},{"name":"Namrata Vaswani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Namrata","lastName":"Vaswani","id":"37270922700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959603","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Kalman filters","Compressed sensing","Image sequences","Time measurement","Biomedical imaging","Brain modeling","Medical simulation","Sparse matrices","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image reconstruction","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MR image reconstruction","Kalman filtered compressed sensing","sparse signals","medical images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing","dynamic MRI"]}],"abstract":"In recent work, Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing (KF-CS) was proposed to causally reconstruct time sequences of sparse signals, from a limited number of ldquoincoherentrdquo measurements.

With good software tools and insightful workload analysis, software and algorithm developers can not only harness the power of many computing cores, but also innovate new algorithms that best utilize the many computing cores. New algorithms and applications are thus made possible with the computing power not available before.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959658","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959658.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges and opportunities of obtaining performance from multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959658/","displayDocTitle":"Challenges and opportunities of obtaining performance from multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700736","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959658/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges and opportunities of obtaining performance from multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041185S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959659,"authors":[{"name":"Fang-Li Yuan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fang-Li","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37630728000"},{"name":"Chin-Hsien Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Hsien","lastName":"Lin","id":"37065289400"},{"name":"Yi-Hsien Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Hsien","lastName":"Lin","id":"37578085000"},{"name":"Chih-Feng Wu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Feng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37419762500"},{"name":"Chorng-Kuang Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chorng-Kuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280016800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959659","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Adaptive equalizers","Physical layer","MIMO","Sampling methods","Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Channel estimation","Telecommunication standards","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","protocols","radio receivers","signal detection","space-time codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital baseband receiver design","adaptive equalization technique","IEEE 802.16 WMAN","multiple input multiple output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","wireless metropolitan area networks","channel estimation","MIMO detection","OFDM PHY","BLMS algorithm","Alamouti-scheme STBC FEQ","space-time block code","frequency-domain equalizer","frequency selective fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","STBC","BLMS"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a 2times2 MIMO-OFDM digital baseband receiver for IEEE 802.16 WMAN-OFDM PHY is presented.

To reduce power consumption and enhance flexibility, this paper presents a speech recognition system composed of a coprocessor and a MCU. The coprocessor is a dedicated hardware design for Output Probability Calculation (OPC), which is the most computation-intensive part in CHMM, and MCU is a 32 bit RISC (ARM).

We reformulate the standard NUFFT approximation as a projection of the exact discrete Fourier transform onto a shift-invariant space. This reformulation enables the use of sophisticated tools, developed in the context of shift-invariant representations, to analyze the performance of the approximation. Using these techniques, we derive the optimal scale factors for a specified interpolator. Assuming these scale factors, we develop a worst-case error criterion that is only dependent on the interpolating function. We propose an iterative re-weighted optimization algorithm to derive the optimized least square (OLS) interpolator. This interpolator significantly reduces the approximation error in comparison to the standard methods. The improved performance of this scheme, for low oversampling factors, could lead to a memory efficient algorithm for non-Cartesian Fourier inversion.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959673","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","startPage":"673","endPage":"676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) for iterative tomographic reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) for iterative tomographic reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959673/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700807","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4959673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) for iterative tomographic reconstruction","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122018S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959678,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Beck","affiliation":["Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Beck","id":"37288381100"},{"name":"Marc Teboulle","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Teboulle","id":"37628651500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959678","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3217},"abstract":"We consider the class of Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing.

For a local stereo method, the key challenge is to decide an appropriate support window for the pixel under consideration. Our stereo method starts with computing an upright local cross adaptively for each anchor pixel, which defines a per-pixel support skeleton. Next, based on this compact local cross representation, we aggregate the matching costs in a shape adaptive full support region using two orthogonal integration steps. Approximating scene structures accurately, the proposed method is among the best-performing real-time stereo methods according to the benchmark Middlebury stereo evaluation. Additionally, our method is very easy to implement, memory efficient, and hence it is promising for many practical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959688.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"736","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time stereo matching: A cross-based local approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Graphics","Skeleton","Costs","Shape","Yield estimation","Aggregates","Layout","Robots","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","image matching","image representation","image thinning","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time stereo matching","cross-based local approach","graphics processing unit","per-pixel support skeleton","compact local cross representation","orthogonal integration steps","scene structure approximation","benchmark Middlebury stereo evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stereo matching","local adaptation","GPGPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-time stereo matching: A cross-based local approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959688/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700876","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time stereo matching: A cross-based local approach","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048155S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4959691,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chung Cheng","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Chung","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37290804900"},{"name":"Chia-Kai Liang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Kai","lastName":"Liang","id":"37401400300"},{"name":"Yen-Chieh Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chieh","lastName":"Lai","id":"37535438200"},{"name":"Homer H.

Its use in image compression is often justified by the notion that it is the statistically optimal transform for first-order Markov signals, which have been used to model images. In standard video codecs, the motion-compensation residual (MC-residual) is also compressed with the DCT. The MC-residual may, however, possess different characteristics from an image. Hence, the question that arises is if other transforms can be developed that can perform better on the MC-residual than the DCT. Inspired by recent research on direction-adaptive image transforms, we provide an adaptive auto-covariance characterization for the MC-residual that shows some statistical differences between the MC-residual and the image. Based on this characterization, we propose a set of block transforms. Experimental results indicate that these transforms can improve the compression efficiency of the MC-residual.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959702","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959702.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transforms for the motion compensation residual","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959702/","displayDocTitle":"Transforms for the motion compensation residual","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700890","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959702/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transforms for the motion compensation residual","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066795S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4959720,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The Lasso regularization was proposed to select the representative training samples from the entire training set (consisting of all the training samples). Lasso however tends to select a single sample from a group of correlated training samples and thus does not promote the representation of the test sample in terms of all the training samples from the correct group.

In this paper, a component-wise pose normalization method for facilitating pose-invariant face recognition is proposed. The main idea is to normalize a non-frontal facial image to a virtual frontal image component by component. In this method, we first partition the whole non-frontal facial image into different facial components and then the virtual frontal view for each component is estimated separately. The final virtual frontal image is generated by integrating the virtual frontal components. The proposed method relies only on 2D images, therefore complex 3D modeling is not needed.

We investigate the influence of the amount of redundancy and of the iterative decoding of the descriptions on the performance.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959733.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple description video coding and iterative decoding of LDPCA codes with side information","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiple description video coding and iterative decoding of LDPCA codes with side information","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701032","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4959733/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple description video coding and iterative decoding of LDPCA codes with side information","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0000913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038482S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959746,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Cheng Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Cheng Chiu","id":"37290428600"},{"name":"Wen-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Chung Chen","id":"37633548600"},{"name":"Min-Yu Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Min-Yu Ku","id":"37636573100"},{"name":"Yuh-Jiun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, National Defense University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuh-Jiun Liu","id":"37633798400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959746","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Vehicle detection","Vehicles","Real time systems","CMOS image sensors","Cameras","Detection algorithms","Search methods","Costs","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","edge detection","image matching","object detection","road traffic","road vehicles","stereo image processing","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous stereo vision system","front-vehicle detection","CMOS camera","binocular system","edge detection","adaptive search method","image matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronous stereovision system","Asynchronous stereovision system","Disparity","Obstacle detection"]}],"abstract":"This study uses two low-cost and compact CMOS cameras to construct an asynchronous binocular system and proposes an effective real-time front-vehicle detection algorithm with the binocular system. The proposed vehicle detection algorithm uses the edge information to detect the region of each front vehicle, and then computes the disparities of the front vehicles by an adaptive search method. According to the disparity values, the relative distances between the front and the host vehicles can be computed. The proposed algorithm of the manuscript conquers the asynchronous exposure problem and cost issue of a binocular system.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for detecting copy-move forgery in digital images, which is considerably more robust to lossy compression, scaling and rotation type of manipulations. Also, to improve the computational complexity in detecting the duplicated image regions, we propose to use the notion of counting bloom filters as an alternative to lexicographic sorting, which is a common component of most of the proposed copy-move forgery detection schemes. Our experimental results show that the proposed features can detect duplicated region in the images very accurately, even when the copied region was undergone severe image manipulations. In addition, it is observed that use of counting bloom filters offers a considerable improvement in time efficiency at the expense of a slight reduction in the robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959768","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959768.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient and robust method for detecting copy-move forgery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959768/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient and robust method for detecting copy-move forgery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701177","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959768/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient and robust method for detecting copy-move forgery","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06125S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4959779,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan D.

Recently, distributed video coding (DVC) has been proposed to reduce encoding complexity to the order of that for still image encoding. In addition, compressive sensing (CS) has been applicable to directly capture compressed image data efficiently. In this paper, by integrating the respective characteristics of DVC and CS, a distributed compressive video sensing (DCVS) framework is proposed to simultaneously capture and compress video data, where almost all computation burdens can be shifted to the decoder, resulting in a very low-complexity encoder. At the decoder, compressed video can be efficiently reconstructed using the modified GPSR (gradient projection for sparse reconstruction) algorithm. With the assistance of the proposed initialization and stopping criteria for GRSR, derived from statistical dependencies among successive video frames, our modified GPSR algorithm can terminate faster and reconstruct better video quality. The performance of our DCVS method is demonstrated via simulations to outperform three known CS reconstruction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959797","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959797.pdf","startPage":"1169","endPage":"1172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed compressive video sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959797/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed compressive video sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701262","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959797/","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed compressive video sensing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057764S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4959798,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Vosoughi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, University of Rochester"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Vosoughi","id":"38098619900"},{"name":"Azadeh Vosoughi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, University of Rochester"],"firstName":"Azadeh","lastName":"Vosoughi","id":"37284729900"},{"name":"Mohammad B.

This transform (called HDDWT) is not shift-invariant; a feature which is desirable particularly for signal denoising. In this paper we propose a new transform, referred to as nonsubsampled HDDWT (NS-HDDWT), which is the shift-invariant version of HDDWT. The NS-HDDWT filter bank is built upon iterated nonsubsampled filter banks which are derived from the HDDWT filter bank in a way that is similar to the a trous algorithm. We employ HDDWT and NS-HDDWT for decomposition of images by performing the separable filtering. The performance of both HDDWT and NS-HDDWT is assessed in image denoising. Experimental results show that the performance of NS-HDDWT is superior to that of HDDWT, and in some cases NS-HDDWT outperforms powerful wavelet-based image denoising methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959798.pdf","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1176","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform for image denoising","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Image denoising","Filter bank","Wavelet transforms","Filtering","Noise reduction","Energy resolution","Signal resolution","Frequency","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","discrete wavelet transforms","image denoising","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform","image denoising","dyadic wavelet frames","oversampled filter banks","signal denoising","nonsubsampled HDDWT","shift-invariant version","NS-HDDWT filter bank","nonsubsampled filter banks","a trous algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transform","nonsubsampled filter bank","shift-invariant","image denoising"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform for image denoising","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959798/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10716049","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonsubsampled higher-density discrete wavelet transform for image denoising","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057155S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4959820,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Nagesh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Nagesh","id":"37643942200"},{"name":"Baoxin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Baoxin Li","id":"37292487900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959820","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":560},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Color","Filters","Mirrors","Image reconstruction","Cameras","Lenses","Reconstruction algorithms","Image storage","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image colour analysis","image reconstruction","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color image","image compression","imaging architecture","CS","compressive sensing","Bayer color filter","reconstruction algorithm","joint sparsity model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","Bayer Color Filter","Joint Sparsity Models","\u21131-Minimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel compressive imaging framework for color images.

In this regard a logarithmic function is first applied to the host signal. Then the transformed signal is quantized using uniform quantization as conventional QIM to embed watermark data within. Finally using inverse transform the watermarked signal is obtained. The watermark extraction is performed using minimum distance decoder. The optimum parameter for data embedding with minimum quantization distortion is derived. Also the probability of error is analytically calculated and verified by simulation. Furthermore data hiding using secret key is proposed and the probability of error is obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional QIM in terms of robustness when the perceptual quality of watermarked image for both methods are similar. Moreover, simulation shows that the proposed scheme has outstanding robustness in comparison with a recent quantization based data hiding method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959863.pdf","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1436","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logarithmic Quantization Index Modulation: A perceptually better way to embed data within a cover signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Watermarking","Distortion","Data mining","Data encapsulation","Robustness","Decoding","Analytical models","Gaussian distribution","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","error statistics","Gaussian distribution","image coding","modulation","private key cryptography","quantisation (signal)","transforms","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logarithmic quantization index modulation","logarithmic function","inverse transform","watermark extraction","minimum distance decoder","data embedding","error probability","quantization based data hiding","secret key"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QIM","logarithmic quantization","digital watermarking","Generalized Gaussian Distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Logarithmic Quantization Index Modulation: A perceptually better way to embed data within a cover signal","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10701610","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logarithmic Quantization Index Modulation: A perceptually better way to embed data within a cover signal","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078829S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4959884,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hong Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Wei-Hong","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37592880400"},{"name":"Ashwin Swaminathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37299642400"},{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277237100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959884","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency response","Large scale integration","Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Digital images","Forensics","Transform coding","Image coding","Image processing","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","frequency response","image coding","multimedia computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tampering-type identification","empirical frequency response","digital image editing software","EFR aproach","linear shift invariant","JPEG compression","multimedia forensics","LSI system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimedia forensics","tampering type identification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959884","abstract":"With the widespread popularity of digital images and the presence of easy-to-use image editing software, content integrity can no longer be taken for granted, and there is a strong need for techniques that not only detect the presence of tampering but also identify its type.

It uses both the simplicity of the pursuit algorithms and optimal Bayesian framework to determine active atoms in sparse representation of a signal. We show that using Bayesian Hypothesis testing to determine the active atoms from the correlations leads to an efficient activity measure. Simulation results show that our suggested algorithm has better performance among the algorithms which have been implemented in our simulations in most of the cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Pursuit algorithm for sparse representation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959892","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959892.pdf","startPage":"1549","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Pursuit algorithm for sparse representation","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959892/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700527","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Pursuit algorithm for sparse representation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128649S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959898,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Slavakis","affiliation":["University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Slavakis","id":"37396746600"},{"name":"Sergios Theodoridis","affiliation":["University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Sergios","lastName":"Theodoridis","id":"37294378100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959898","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959898","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Kernel","Hilbert space","Training data","Support vector machines","Learning systems","Constraint optimization","Cost function","Signal processing","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","electrical engineering computing","Hilbert spaces","learning (artificial intelligence)","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affinely constrained online learning","online kernel-based learning tasks","reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces","beamforming task","unconstrained kernel-based regression method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Learning systems","Beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959898","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959898.pdf","startPage":"1573","endPage":"1576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affinely constrained online learning and its application to beamforming","abstract":"This paper presents a novel method for incorporating a-priori affine constraints in online kernel-based learning tasks. The proposed technique elaborates the generic tool of projections to form a sequence of estimates in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The method guarantees that the whole sequence of estimates lies in the given affine constraint set. To validate the algorithm, a beamforming task is considered. The numerical results show that the proposed frame provides with solutions in cases where the classical linear approach collapses, and forms proper beam-patterns as opposed to a recent unconstrained kernel-based regression method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959898/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10700533","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959898/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Affinely constrained online learning and its application to beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affinely constrained online learning and its application to beamforming","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075886S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959932,"authors":[{"name":"Radoslaw Mazur","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, University of L\u00fcbeck, Lubeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Radoslaw","lastName":"Mazur","id":"37626767400"},{"name":"Alfred Mertins","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, University of L\u00fcbeck, Lubeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Mertins","id":"37271261500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959932","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Finite impulse response filter","Independent component analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Time frequency analysis","Source separation","Convolution","Computational efficiency","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","distortion","filtering theory","FIR filters","independent component analysis","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaling ambiguity","convolutive blind source separation","time-frequency domain","ICA algorithm","permutation problem","minimal distortion principle","unmixing filter","independent component analysis","FIR filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation","convolutive mixture","frequency-domain ICA","scaling problem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose to use the scaling ambiguity of convolutive blind source separation for shortening the unmixing filters. An often used approach for separating convolutive mixtures is the transformation to the time-frequency domain where an instantaneous ICA algorithm can be applied for each frequency separately. This approach leads to the so called permutation and scaling ambiguity. While different methods for the permutation problem have been widely studied, the solution for the scaling problem is usually based on the minimal distortion principle. We propose an alternative approach that allows the unmixing filters to be as short as possible. Shorter unmixing filters will suffer less from circular-convolution effects that are inherent to unmixing approaches based on bin-wise ICA followed by permutation and scaling correction. The results for the new algorithm will be shown on a real-world example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the scaling ambiguity for filter shortening in convolutive blind source separation","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959932","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959932.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using the scaling ambiguity for filter shortening in convolutive blind source separation","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959932/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10700675","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the scaling ambiguity for filter shortening in convolutive blind source separation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052602S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4959952,"authors":[{"name":"Sunho Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, POSTECH, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunho","lastName":"Park","id":"37635284500"},{"name":"Jiho Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, POSTECH, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jiho","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37578120300"},{"name":"Seungjin Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, POSTECH, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungjin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37279911600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2353-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2354-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"}],"articleNumber":"4959952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Acoustic noise","Background noise","Speech enhancement","Data mining","Working environment noise","Blind source separation","Interference suppression","Automatic speech recognition","Loudspeakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convolution","feature extraction","interference (signal)","speaker recognition","spectral analysis","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech extraction","learned spectral bases","noisy convolutive mixtures","interference source","target speaker utterances","statistical latent variable model","blind source separation","channel selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation","speech extraction","speech segregation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4959952","abstract":"In this paper we present a method for extracting a speech signal of target speaker from noisy convolutive mixtures of target speech and an interference source, when training utterances of the target speaker are available. We incorporate a statistical latent variable model into blind source separation (BSS), where we make use of spectral bases learned from the training utterances of the target speaker to identify which source corresponds to the target speaker. Combined with any existing BSS methods, our post-processing (which is the main contribution) consists of two steps: (1) channel selection where we identify the source corresponding to the target speaker; (2) enhancement where we further suppress the remaining interference. Numerical experiments confirm that our method substantially improves the separation quality of existing BSS methods and successfully restores the target speaker's speech.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959952","startPage":"1789","endPage":"1792","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4912736/4959496/04959952.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4959496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target speech extractionwith learned spectral bases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Target speech extractionwith learned spectral bases","conferenceDate":"19-24 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4959952/","accessionNumber":"10700751","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4959952/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target speech extractionwith learned spectral bases","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0001789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061793S","chronDate":"19-24 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4912736","isNumber":"4959496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4912736","xplore-issue":"4959496","articleId":"4959952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
