OFDM is a promising technology for next-generation optical networks to support high capacity and heterogeneity in network traffic by having flexible bandwidth allocation per wavelength. Another paradigm for supporting traffic heterogeneity and high bandwidth demands is mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks where wavelengths can have discrete capacities of 10/40/100 Gbps which are single carrier based. In this study, we compare the energy efficiency of an OFDM-based network versus a MLR network. We formulate mixed integer linear program (MILP) models to design energy-efficient MLR and OFDM-based networks with two scenarios: (1) with fixed average traffic per source-destination pair of the network, and (2) with uncertainties in the traffic that an actual network may have. For scenario (2), we employ a robust optimization technique which is called \u03c4-robust optimization. Our results show that OFDM outperforms MLR in terms of energy efficiency especially when the traffic in the network takes random peaks in some of the links.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2245301","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6423865/06450020.pdf","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2245301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Design of Spectrum-Efficient Green Optical Backbone Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450020/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Design of Spectrum-Efficient Green Optical Backbone Networks","volume":"31","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13323534","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450020/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Design of Spectrum-Efficient Green Optical Backbone Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-nag-2245301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107276S","chronDate":"April1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6423865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6423865","articleId":"6450020","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450022,"authors":[{"name":"Mu Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Mu Xu received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2010 from Department of Sophisticated Instruments and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.

Many such light trapping designs involve structuring of the active region itself. Optimization of these designs is aided by the use of computer simulations that account for both the optics and electronics of the device. We describe such a simulation-based approach that accounts for experimental tradeoffs between high-aspect ratio structuring and electronic material quality. Our model explicitly accounts for localized regions of degraded material quality that is induced by light trapping structures in n-i-p a-Si:H solar cells. We find that the geometry of the defects couples to the geometry of light absorption profiles in the active region and that this coupling impacts the spectral response of the device. Our approach yields insights into the nanoscale device physics that is associated with localized geometry-induced defects and provides a framework for full optoelectronic optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13401327","htmlLink":"/document/6450024/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accounting for Localized Defects in the Optoelectronic Design of Thin-Film Solar Cells","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Accounting for Localized Defects in the Optoelectronic Design of Thin-Film Solar Cells","sourcePdf":"jphotov-deceglie-2240764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067735S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5503869","isNumber":"6481434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503869","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6481434","articleId":"6450024","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450025,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuping Jia","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University College, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6461951/6450025/6450025-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiuping Jia (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1982 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia, in 1996.","Since 1988, she has been with the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Canberra Campus, NSW, Australia, where she is currently a Senior Lecturer.

The resulting high-dimensional data contain rich information for a wide range of applications. However, for a specific application, not all the measurements are important and useful. The original feature space may not be the most effective space for representing the data. Feature mining, which includes feature generation, feature selection (FS), and feature extraction (FE), is a critical task for hyperspectral data classification. Significant research effort has focused on this issue since hyperspectral data became available in the late 1980s. The feature mining techniques which have been developed include supervised and unsupervised, parametric and nonparametric, linear and nonlinear methods, which all seek to identify the informative subspace. This paper provides an overview of both conventional and advanced feature reduction methods, with details on a few techniques that are commonly used for analysis of hyperspectral data. A general form that represents several linear and nonlinear FE methods is also presented. Experiments using two widely available hyperspectral data sets are included to illustrate selected FS and FE methods.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2229082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2229082","startPage":"676","endPage":"697","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6461951/06450025.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Mining for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Feature Mining for Hyperspectral Image Classification","volume":"101","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13324020","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450025/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Mining for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"jproc-jia-2229082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.260263S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6461951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"245","xplore-issue":"6461951","articleId":"6450025","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6450026,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Lopez","affiliation":["Institute for Applied Microelectronics (IUMA), University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6461951/6450026/6450026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sebastian Lopez (Member, IEEE) was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, in 1978.

With the advent of new hyperspectral remote sensing missions and their increased temporal resolutions, the availability and dimensionality of hyperspectral data is continuously increasing. This demands fast processing solutions that can be used to compress and/or interpret hyperspectral data onboard spacecraft imaging platforms in order to reduce downlink connection requirements and perform a more efficient exploitation of hyperspectral data sets in various applications. Over the last few years, reconfigurable hardware solutions such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been consolidated as the standard choice for onboard remote sensing processing due to their smaller size, weight, and power consumption when compared with other high-performance computing systems, as well as to the availability of more FPGAs with increased tolerance to ionizing radiation in space. Although there have been many literature sources on the use of FPGAs in remote sensing in general and in hyperspectral remote sensing in particular, there is no specific reference discussing the state-of-the-art and future trends of applying this flexible and dynamic technology to such missions. In this work, a necessary first step in this direction is taken by providing an extensive review and discussion of the (current and future) capabilities of reconfigurable hardware and FPGAs in the context of hyperspectral remote sensing missions. The review covers both technological aspects of FPGA hardware and implementation issues, providing two specific case studies in which FPGAs are successfully used to improve the compression and interpretation (through spectral unmixing concepts) of remotely sensed hyperspectral data. Based on the two considered case studies, we also highlight the major challenges to be addressed in the near future in this emerging and fast growing research area.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2231391","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6461951/06450026.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2231391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Promise of Reconfigurable Computing for Hyperspectral Imaging Onboard Systems: A Review and Trends","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"The Promise of Reconfigurable Computing for Hyperspectral Imaging Onboard Systems: A Review and Trends","volume":"101","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13324021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450026/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450026/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Promise of Reconfigurable Computing for Hyperspectral Imaging Onboard Systems: A Review and Trends","sourcePdf":"jproc-plaza-2231391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173499S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6461951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6461951","articleId":"6450026","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450036,"authors":[{"name":"Huda A.

It is pointed out that the previously reported lumped element equivalent circuit models of SRR- and CSRR-loaded lines (where cross polarization is not considered) are valid as long as the slits are orthogonally oriented to the line axis, and new models that include cross polarization are presented and discussed. The validity and accuracy of the models is demonstrated through parameter extraction and comparison to full-wave electromagnetic simulations and measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas

phase offset selected mapping (SLM) scheme is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in Alamouti coded multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, and its key idea is that different phase rotation sequences are multiplied by their corresponding phase offsets at the transmitter. Moreover, a minimum Euclidian distance (MED) decoder at the receiver is proposed to recover the phase rotation sequences. Therefore, the proposed SLM scheme does not need to reserve bits for the transmission of side information, resulting in the increase of the data rate. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed SLM scheme could offer good performances of both the bit error rate and PAPR reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Phase Offset SLM Scheme for PAPR Reduction in Alamouti MIMO-OFDM Systems Without Side Information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2245119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6461093/06450055.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2245119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Phase Offset SLM Scheme for PAPR Reduction in Alamouti MIMO-OFDM Systems Without Side Information","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6450055/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13353428","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Phase Offset SLM Scheme for PAPR Reduction in Alamouti MIMO-OFDM Systems Without Side Information","sourcePdf":"lsp-jiang-2245119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056699S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6461093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6461093","articleId":"6450055","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450065,"authors":[{"name":"Weichao Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System (HIT), Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Weichao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37406008700"},{"name":"Huijun Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System (HIT), Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Huijun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277495500"},{"name":"Bin Yao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37286440100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6450065","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":169,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2851},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450065","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Suspensions","Actuators","Robust control","Electrohydraulics","Adaptive control","Vehicle dynamics","H infinity control","Vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","automobiles","closed loop systems","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","electrohydraulic control equipment","H\u221e control","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","performance index","robust control","suspensions (mechanical components)","uncertain systems","vehicle dynamics","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive robust vibration control","full-car active suspension","electrohydraulic actuators","vibration suppression","vehicular active suspension systems","vehicle attitude stabilization","riding comfort improvement","full-car model","highly nonlinear characteristics","H\u221e performance","disturbance suppression","actuator force","virtual input","adaptive robust control technology","controller design","actuator parametric uncertainties","uncertain actuator nonlinearities","stability analysis","Lyapunov framework","numerical example","control law","road condition","closed-loop system performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":[" $H_{\\infty}$ control","active suspension system","adaptive control","full-car model","robust control"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of vibration suppression in vehicular active suspension systems, whose aim is to stabilize the attitude of the vehicle and improve the riding comfort.

The frame is based on the combination of wavelet polarization information, textons, and sparse coding. Polarimetric synthesis unites with the discrete wavelet frame to obtain wavelet polarization variance through the calculation of the wavelet variance in the space of polarization states. The K-means cluster algorithm is implemented to cluster the wavelet polarization variance vectors of the training samples for the purpose of constructing a texton dictionary. A patch, in which all the wavelet polarization variance vectors match those in the texton dictionary, is used to obtain a statistical histogram. Sparse coding is applied to describe the histogram feature and generate a new texture feature called sparse coding of a wavelet polarization texton. Finally, support vector machine is used for the classification. All experiments are carried out on five sets of PolSAR data.

We first generalize the error entropy criterion to complex domain to present the complex error entropy criterion (CEEC). Due to the difficulty in estimating the entropy of complex-valued error directly, the entropy bound minimization (EBM) method is used to compute the upper bounds of the entropy of the complex-valued error, and the tightest bound selected by the EBM algorithm is used as the estimator of the complex-error entropy. Then, based on the minimization of complex-error entropy (MCEE) and the complex gradient descent approach, complex-valued learning algorithms for both the (linear) transverse filter and the (nonlinear) neural network are derived. The algorithms are applied to complex-valued linear filtering and complex-valued nonlinear channel equalization to demonstrate their effectiveness and advantages.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2241788","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6477170/06450100.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"708","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2241788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex-Valued Filtering Based on the Minimization of Complex-Error Entropy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Complex-Valued Filtering Based on the Minimization of Complex-Error Entropy","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13382485","pubMedId":"24808421","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450100/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex-Valued Filtering Based on the Minimization of Complex-Error Entropy","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2241788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105751S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6477170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6477170","articleId":"6450100","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6450109,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6504823/6450109/6450109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Wei Huang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in communications engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.","Her research interests focus on wireless communications and signal processing"]},"firstName":"Chao-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37717061100"},{"name":"Tsung-Hui Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6504823/6450109/6450109-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Hui Chang (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","Since September 2012, he has been with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan, as an Assistant Professor.

This work improves upon the original discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme proposed by Chang where multiple stages of feedback and retraining were used. While most studies on physical layer secrecy are under the information-theoretic framework and focus directly on the data transmission phase, studies on DCE focus on the training phase and aim to provide a practical signal processing technique to discriminate between the channel estimation performances (and, thus, the effective received signal qualities) at LR and UR. A key feature of DCE designs is the insertion of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal to degrade the channel estimation performance at UR. To do so, AN must be placed in a carefully chosen subspace, based on the transmitter's knowledge of LR's channel, in order to minimize its effect on LR. In this paper, we adopt the idea of two-way training that allows both the transmitter and LR to send training signals to facilitate channel estimation at both ends. Both reciprocal and nonreciprocal channels are considered and a two-way DCE scheme is proposed for each scenario. For mathematical tractability, we assume that all terminals employ the linear minimum mean square error criterion for channel estimation. Based on the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimates at all terminals, we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the optimal power allocation between the training signal and AN is found by minimizing the MSE of LR's channel estimate subject to a constraint on the MSE achievable at UR. Numerical results show that the proposed DCE schemes can effectively discriminate between the channel estimation and, hence, the data detection performances at LR and UR.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2245124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6504823/06450109.pdf","startPage":"2724","endPage":"2738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2245124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Way Training for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450109/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Way Training for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13730216","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450109/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Way Training for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-hong-2245124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171008S","chronDate":"May15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6504823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6504823","articleId":"6450109","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450110,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6492148/6450110/6450110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang (S'05\u2013M'12) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","He was an intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA, in summer 2010.

To address this problem, we introduce a parametric approach by employing a set of distinctive auto-regressive (AR) models, one for each TX-RX pair, to model the non-homogeneous disturbance signals. We develop a parametric generalized likelihood ratio test (PGLRT), referred to as the MIMO-PGLRT detector, for MTD in distributed MIMO radars. The MIMO-PGLRT detector, which consists of local adaptive subspace detection, non-coherent combining using local decision variables, and a global threshold comparison, is shown to asymptotically achieve constant false alarm rate (CFAR). We also investigate the target velocity estimation problem, an integral part of MTD, and develop its maximum likelihood estimator. The Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, in both the exact and asymptotic forms, respectively, is examined to shed additional light to the problem. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6492148/06450110.pdf","startPage":"2282","endPage":"2294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2245323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2245323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parametric Moving Target Detector for Distributed MIMO Radar in Non-Homogeneous Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","MIMO radar","Detectors","Radar antennas","Object detection","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO radar","radar clutter","radar target recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric moving target detector","distributed MIMO radar","nonhomogeneous environment","multiinput multioutput radars","disturbance signal","clutter","noise","transmit-receive antenna","autoregressive models","parametric generalized likelihood ratio test","MIMO-PGLRT detector","constant false alarm rate","target velocity estimation","maximum likelihood estimator","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auto-regressive process","distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","moving target detection","non-homogeneous clutter","velocity estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Parametric Moving Target Detector for Distributed MIMO Radar in Non-Homogeneous Environment","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6450110/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13428266","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parametric Moving Target Detector for Distributed MIMO Radar in Non-Homogeneous Environment","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2245323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084615S","chronDate":"May1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6492148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6492148","articleId":"6450110","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450112,"authors":[{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402452900"},{"name":"Vincent K.

The CF/DPF framework is based on running localized particle filters to estimate the overall state vector at each observation node. Separate fusion filters are designed to consistently assimilate the local filtering distributions into the global posterior by compensating for the common past information between neighboring nodes. The CF/DPF offers two distinct advantages over its counterparts. First, the CF/DPF framework is suitable for scenarios where network connectivity is intermittent and consensus can not be reached between two consecutive observations. Second, the CF/DPF is not limited to the Gaussian approximation for the global posterior density. A third contribution of the paper is the derivation of the exact expression for computing the posterior Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) for the distributed architecture based on a recursive procedure involving the local Fisher information matrices (FIMs) of the distributed estimators. The performance of the CF/DPF algorithm closely follows the centralized particle filter approaching the PCRLB at the signal to noise ratios that we tested.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Particle Filter Implementation With Intermittent/Irregular Consensus Convergence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2245123","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6504823/06450113.pdf","startPage":"2572","endPage":"2587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2245123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Particle Filter Implementation With Intermittent/Irregular Consensus Convergence","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6450113/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","publicationDate":"May15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13474410","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Particle Filter Implementation With Intermittent/Irregular Consensus Convergence","sourcePdf":"tsp-mohammadi-2245123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106588S","chronDate":"May15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6504823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6504823","articleId":"6450113","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450114,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Broadcom, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6492148/6450114/6450114-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Wang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2003 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 2012.","She has been working on LTE with the Broadcom Corporation since summer 2012.

Its principal advantage over the multi-carrier scheme is its lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we propose a new fast iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal finite impulse response (FIR) minimum-mean-square-error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SC communication systems over ISI channels based on the QR decomposition of an augmented Toeplitz channel matrix. The proposed algorithm is not only computationally efficient but also very frugal in its memory usage. The algorithm applies to MIMO systems with any number of transmitting and receiving antennas, either balanced or unbalanced. The iterative nature of the proposed algorithm enables a flexible choice of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</sub>\n, the length of the feedforward filter (FFF), which leads to a controllable trade-off between complexity and performance.

A novel underlaying resource-sharing communication mode for vehicular networks is proposed, in which different V2V and V2I communication links are permitted to access the same resources for their individual data transmission. To solve the resource-sharing problem in vehicular networks, we, for the first time, apply graph theory and propose the following two interference graph-based resource-sharing schemes: 1) the interference-aware graph-based resource-sharing scheme and 2) the interference-classified graph-based resource-sharing scheme. Compared with the traditional orthogonal communication mode in vehicular networks, the proposed two resource-sharing schemes express better network sum rate. The utility of the proposed V2V and V2I underlaying communication mode and the two proposed interference graph-based resource-sharing schemes are verified by simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6631523/06450121.pdf","startPage":"4028","endPage":"4039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2245156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2245156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Graph-Based Resource-Sharing Schemes for Vehicular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Vehicles","Data communication","Optimization","Radio transmitters","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","graph theory","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicular networks","interference graph","resource-sharing problem","vehicle-to-vehicle communication links","V2V communication links","vehicle-to-infrastructure communication links","V2I communication links","resource-sharing communication mode","data transmission","graph theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference-aware graph","interference-classified graph","resource sharing","vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication","vehicle-to- vehicle (V2V) communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Interference Graph-Based Resource-Sharing Schemes for Vehicular Networks","volume":"62","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6450121/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843040","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Graph-Based Resource-Sharing Schemes for Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-cheng-2245156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084631S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6631523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6631523","articleId":"6450121","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6450122,"authors":[{"name":"Gerry Taylor","affiliation":["Analog Devices, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6484888/6450122/6450122-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerry Taylor received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 1990 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, San Diego, CA, USA, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","From 1992 to 2006, he was with a number of startup companies including Micro Linear, Antrim Design Systems, and Vativ Technologies, where he designed high-speed data converters and analog front-end integrated circuits.

However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the selection of the validity indexes, and one single-objective function may not provide satisfactory results because of the complexity of remote sensing images. For instance, the same land types may have different spectral curves, and different land types can have similar curves. To avoid this problem, this paper proposes a novel automatic fuzzy clustering method based on adaptive multi-objective differential evolution (AFCMDE) for remote sensing imagery. In AFCMDE, the automatic clustering problem is transformed into a multi-objective problem using two objective functions: J\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n and the Xie-Beni index. AFCMDE is designed as a two-layer system comprising an optimization layer and a classification layer. In the optimization layer, AFCMDE searches for a feasible number of clusters by minimizing the J\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n value and the Xie-Beni index. Based on the obtained number of clusters, AFCMDE utilizes non-dominated and crowd-distance sorting to obtain the optimal clustering centers and output the clustering results. In addition, a self-adaptive strategy without user-defined parameters is also used to improve the differential evolution. Experimental results using three different types of remote sensing image show that the AFCMDE algorithm consistently outperforms the other traditional clustering algorithms and the previous single-objective automatic fuzzy clustering algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13794996","htmlLink":"/document/6450129/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Fuzzy Clustering Based on Adaptive Multi-Objective Differential Evolution for Remote Sensing Imagery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Fuzzy Clustering Based on Adaptive Multi-Objective Differential Evolution for Remote Sensing Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhong-2240655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106057S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6605551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6605551","articleId":"6450129","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450146,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Fu Li","affiliation":["Chair on Systems Science and the Energetic challenge, European Foundation for New Energy-Electricite' de France, Ecole Centrale Paris and Supelec, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6563116/6450146/6450146-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan-Fu Li (S'05\u2013M'11) received the Ph.D. degree at the National University of Singapore in 2009.","He is an Assistant Professor at Ecole Centrale Paris (ECP) and Ecole Superieure d'Electricite (SUPELEC), Paris, France.

To find the solution of the optimal schedule of the generation units, a memetic evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which combines the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and a local search algorithm. The power dispatch sub-problem is solved by the weighed-sum lambda-iteration approach. The proposed method has been tested on systems composed by 10 and 100 generation units for a 24-hour demand horizon. The Pareto-optimal front obtained contains solutions of different trade off with respect to the two objectives of cost and emission, which are superior to those contained in the Pareto-front obtained by the pure NSGA-II. The solutions of minimum cost are shown to compare well with recent published results obtained by single-objective cost optimization algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6563116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2241795","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2241795","startPage":"2660","endPage":"2669","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6563116/06450146.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450146/","displayDocTitle":"A Memetic Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization Method for Environmental Power Unit Commitment","volume":"28","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13686480","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450146/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Memetic Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization Method for Environmental Power Unit Commitment","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-li-2241795-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104788S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6563116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6563116","articleId":"6450146","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6450151,"authors":[{"name":"Yufei Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6471805/6450151/6450151-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yufei Tang received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston.","His research interests include power system modeling, power system stability control, wind energy generation and integration, smart grid, and the application of computational intelligence in power systems."]},"firstName":"Yufei","lastName":"Tang","id":"38541636800"},{"name":"Ping Ju","affiliation":["Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6471805/6450151/6450151-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Ju (SM'10) received the B.Eng. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Southeast University, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1988.","From 1994 to 1995, he was an Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellow at the University of Dortmund, Germany.

Among many enabling technologies, the latest research results from both the power and energy community and computational intelligence (CI) community have demonstrated that CI research could provide key technical innovations into this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach based on both trajectory and frequency domain information integrated with evolutionary algorithm to achieve the optimal control of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) based wind generation. Instead of optimizing all the control parameters, our key idea is to use the sensitivity analysis to first identify the critical parameters, the unified dominate control parameters (UDCP), to reduce the optimization complexity. Based on such selected parameters, we then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal values to achieve the control objective. Simulation analysis and comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355364","htmlLink":"/document/6450151/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimized Control of DFIG-Based Wind Generation Using Sensitivity Analysis and Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Control of DFIG-Based Wind Generation Using Sensitivity Analysis and Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsg-he-2237795-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11205S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6450151","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6450163,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6507371/6450163/6450163-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Huang (S'09) received his B.Eng. degree in electronic and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003.

The design is based on a nontrivial extension of EXIT-chart based design. Specifically, we analyze the components of the IRA-PNC scheme and propose an approach to model the soft information exchanged between these components. Then, we develop upper and lower bounds on the extrinsic information transfer functions to characterize the iterative process of computing the network-coded information. Based on that, we construct optimized IRA codes to minimize the computation error at the relay. The optimized IRA-PNC has considerable performance improvement over the existing regular RA coded PNC. For a rate 3/4 code, as an example, we observed improvements of 2.6 dB, and the optimized IRA-PNC scheme is only about 1.7 dB away from the capacity upper bound of the Gaussian two-way relay channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","volume":"61","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13474330","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450163/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Irregular Repeat-Accumulate Coded Physical-Layer Network Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Relay Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Irregular Repeat-Accumulate Coded Physical-Layer Network Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"0897-tc1303-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154264S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6507371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6507371","articleId":"6450163","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6450167,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Xi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Biomedical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ning Xi (Xin@egr.msu.edu) is currently a university distinguished professor and John D.

AFM can obtain ultrahigh-resolution images at the subnanoscale level. However, AFM has a very significant drawback of slow imaging speed, which is due to its working principle. A conventional AFM conducts a raster scan of an entire area to generate a topography image. Therefore, the frame rate is low, making it impossible for observation of biological and physical processes that are dynamic in nature with a lifespan of a few minutes or even seconds, such as the structural change of cells, carbon nanotube shape change, and so forth [2]?[5]. In addition, for AFM-based nanomanipulations and nanomeasurement, the low frame rate makes it difficult to achieve a real-time visual guide manipulation [6], [7]. Operators usually have to wait for finishing imaging to visualize the manipulating results. Therefore, there is an increasing demand on a fast-imaging AFM system that can capture a continuous phenomenon occurring in seconds.","doi":"10.1109/MNANO.2013.2237711","pdfPath":"/iel5/4451717/6486537/06450167.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNANO.2013.2237711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6486537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Rate Atomic Force Microscopy: Use of compressive scanning for nanoscale video imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Video Rate Atomic Force Microscopy: Use of compressive scanning for nanoscale video imaging","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398108","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450167/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Rate Atomic Force Microscopy: Use of compressive scanning for nanoscale video imaging","sourcePdf":"07mnano01-xi-2237711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064866S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4451717","isNumber":"6486537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4451717","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6486537","articleId":"6450167","onlineDate":"05 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6450177,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4587-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4585-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4586-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6450177","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":928},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice to IEEE Xplore subscribers","doi":"10.1109/CARPI.2012.6450177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450176","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd International Conference on Applied Robotics for the Power Industry (CARPI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd International Conference on Applied Robotics for the Power Industry (CARPI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340040/6450176/06450177.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CARPI.2012.6450177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450177","abstract":"The content formerly presented as the proceedings of this conference in IEEE Xplore was found to be unauthorized, and thus a wholly inaccurate representation of the proceedings of the conference.The content now presented as the proceedings of this conference has been verified as a true and accurate representation of the research presented at the conference.

Moreover, this machine (e.g. 5-phase induction machine) can provide more options for selecting the most optimum voltage vector since the number of switching devices of the inverter increases that can enhance torque capability and improve dynamic performances. However, the great advantageous offered cannot be realized if the switching and control strategy performed at very low sampling frequency which does not guarantee for the multiphase drive to operate at optimum operations. This paper presents the realization of five-phase sinusoidal PWM signal generator at fast sampling frequency using one-chip programmable gate array (FPGA). It can be shown that the generation of sinusoidal PWM using FPGA can perform the switching frequency of the inverter at 40 kHz switching frequency that may raise potential for excellent drive performances.","doi":"10.1109/PECon.2012.6450229","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423700/6450178/06450229.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECon.2012.6450229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based five-phase sinusoidal PWM generator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450229/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based five-phase sinusoidal PWM generator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290533","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450229/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based five-phase sinusoidal PWM generator","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p314sutikno.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045197S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423700","isNumber":"6450178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423700","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6450178","articleId":"6450229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450241,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Sheraz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Sheraz","id":"38547318400"},{"name":"Mohammed A.

It has non-linear P-V characteristics that will vary with irradiation and temperature, which will affect the output power of PV array. This nonlinear behavior becomes more complex in partial shading and rapidly changing irradiation conditions. Conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods fail to track and extract the maximum power from the PV array in such conditions. Another problem with the conventional methods is the steady state oscillations. All these factors result in power losses. This paper presents a new method for the tracking of Maximum Power Point (MPP) based on Differential Evolution (DE) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). DE has the capacity to optimize the non-linear problem without the use of gradient and ANN has the ability to model complex relationship between the inputs and outputs. Combining both techniques will result in a better controller. The proposed controller will adjust the Duty ratio `D' of the Boost converter to track maximum power from PV array and gives the constant output voltage. The proposed MPPT method has been developed and simulated using the MATLAB software package. Analysis and comparison show that proposed controller can track the MPP in less time compared to conventional MPP methods and without any fluctuation in steady state. The robustness of the proposed controller has been demonstrated in the partial shading and rapidly changing irradiation conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450241/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13290544","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450241/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient MPPT controller using differential evolution and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient MPPT controller using differential evolution and neural network","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p378sheraz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061694S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423700","isNumber":"6450178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423700","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6450178","articleId":"6450241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6450263,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been adopted and incorporated into the back-propagation learning algorithm for training feed-forward neural networks. The inputs of ANN are organized in coordination with the results of the observability analysis of synchronous generator dynamic parameters in its dynamic behavior. A collection of ANNs with similar input patterns but different outputs are developed to determine a set of the dynamic parameters. The ANNs are employed and tested to identify the above parameters by the on-line measurements which are carried out within each kind of fault separately. Simulation studies indicate the ANN observer has a great ability to identify the dynamic parameters of the solid-rotor synchronous generators. The results also show that the tests which have given more accurate results in estimation of each parameter can be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/PECon.2012.6450263","startPage":"493","endPage":"498","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECon.2012.6450263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450178","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423700/6450178/06450263.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural network observer for on-line estimation of solid-rotor Synchronous Generators' Dynamic Parameters using the operating data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450263/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of neural network observer for on-line estimation of solid-rotor Synchronous Generators' Dynamic Parameters using the operating data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450263/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13290565","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural network observer for on-line estimation of solid-rotor Synchronous Generators' Dynamic Parameters using the operating data","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p493shariati.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075409S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423700","isNumber":"6450178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423700","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6450178","articleId":"6450263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6450279,"authors":[{"name":"Puteri Nor Ashikin Megat Yunus","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Puteri Nor Ashikin","lastName":"Megat Yunus","id":"37087765035"},{"name":"Mustafar Kamal Hamzah","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mustafar Kamal","lastName":"Hamzah","id":"37293969300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5019-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5017-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5018-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6450279","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Resistors","Switches","Matrix converters","Pulse width modulation","Rectifiers","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","commutation","harmonic distortion","matrix convertors","power conversion harmonics","power filters","PWM power convertors","PWM rectifiers","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safe commutation switching sequence","AC-DC single phase matrix converter","SPMC","LC filter","damping resistor","PWM technique","nonsinusoidal input current","THD supply current","rectifier performances","Matlab-Simulink simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SPMC","THD","PWM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450279","abstract":"In this paper, simulation of safe commutation switching sequence for an AC-DC single-phase matrix converter (SPMC) with combination of conventional LC filter and damping resistor were proposed.

Therefore, it is significant to include an intelligent controller that can track the maximum peak regardless of wind speed. This paper describes the design and development of particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm to variable-speed fixed-pitch wind turbines. Other than the electrical power subjected to maximization, the proposed algorithm does not need any additional sensor. In addition, the MPPT algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the wind energy system. Unlike the conventional search optimization method, PSO-based MPPT algorithm produces almost negligible oscillations at the maximum power once the true peak is located. In short, the proposed MPPT is simple, flexible, accurate and efficient in maximum wind power tracking. In this work, MATLAB/Simulink simulation package is used to simulate the performance of the proposed MPPT algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450296/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13307827","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450296/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization-based maximum power point tracking algorithm for wind energy conversion system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization-based maximum power point tracking algorithm for wind energy conversion system","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p65abdullah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053969S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423700","isNumber":"6450178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423700","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6450178","articleId":"6450296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450324,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulhamid A.

The motor is built using three main components i.e. laminated steel iron, coils, and Neodymium-Iron-Boron permanent magnet. The permanent magnet is attached to the surface of the rotor. The motor have 360 winding turns per phase and 10 A maximum current is flowing into the coils. The induced back-emf, cogging torque, and magnetic flux of the motor are analyzed. The results show that the motor is capable to generate an approximately 550 V back-emf, low cogging torque less than 0.5 Nm, maximum power of 5.5 kW and average torque of 81 Nm. The value of back-emf can be adjusted by changing the motor parameters such as coil turns per phase, rotor radius, axial length or magnet thickness. These values will determine the motor parameters required to design the power electronics converter for LEV.","doi":"10.1109/PECon.2012.6450354","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423700/6450178/06450354.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PECon.2012.6450354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotating analysis of 18-slot/16-pole Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor for Light Electric Vehicle using FEM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450354/","displayDocTitle":"Rotating analysis of 18-slot/16-pole Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor for Light Electric Vehicle using FEM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290632","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450354/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotating analysis of 18-slot/16-pole Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor for Light Electric Vehicle using FEM","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p946rezal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042959S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423700","isNumber":"6450178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423700","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6450178","articleId":"6450354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6450365,"authors":[{"name":"Vini Tuteja","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Vini","lastName":"Tuteja","id":"38235109100"},{"name":"Jignesh B.

In this context, control of power supplies has been traditionally achieved through analog means with dedicated integrated circuits (ICs). As power systems are becoming gradually more complex, the classical concept of control has increasingly evolve into the more general problem of power management, demanding functionalities that are hardly attainable in analog controllers. Using digital control in power supplies is significantly more flexible than analog control in its ability to adapt to changes and digital control inside the power supply results in advantages to the system application such as improved efficiency, external components and overall cost reduced. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is preferred for power supply due to its merits. The feature of reprogramming capability of FPGA makes design easy and practical implementation within a short time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 5th India International Conference on Power Electronics (IICPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6421217/6450364/06450435.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 5th India International Conference on Power Electronics (IICPE)","doi":"10.1109/IICPE.2012.6450435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICPE.2012.6450435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based digitalized power supplies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Switches","Argon","Sensors","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power integrated circuits","power supply circuits","very high speed integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","digitalized power supplies","control strategies","output current demand","integrated circuits","power management","demanding functionalities","analog controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language(VHDL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based digitalized power supplies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291438","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based digitalized power supplies","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"Paper071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097184S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6421217","isNumber":"6450364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6421217","xplore-issue":"6450364","articleId":"6450435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450445,"authors":[{"name":"Prakash Chittora","affiliation":["Electrical Department, Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Chittora","id":"38548285200"},{"name":"Narendra Kumar","affiliation":["Electrical Department, Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Narendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37343824200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0934-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0931-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0933-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3162"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-3162"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3170"}],"articleNumber":"6450445","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450445","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shafts","Torque","Mathematical model","Damping","Oscillators","Generators","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","damping","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","IEEE standards","power system stability","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine damping","series compensated power system","IMDU characteristics","subsynchronous resonance damping","T-G shaft","IEEE first benchmark model","eigenvalue analysis","time domain simulations","HP turbine","SSR mitigation","transient stability","torsional oscillations","SSR damping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction machine damping unit (IMDU)","subsynchronous resonance (SSR)","damping oscillations","modelling","IEEE first benchmark model","eigenvalue analysis"]}],"abstract":"The main focus of this paper is to analyse IMDU characteristics to damp subsynchronous resonance.

But presence of series capacitor has sometimes been limited because of the concern for subsynchronous resonance phenomenon in transmission line. SSR is basically an electrical power system condition where the electrical network exchanges energy with the turbine generator at one or more of the natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency of the system. Presence of SSR torque causes oscillation which causes shaft fatigue and possible damage or failure of shaft. Long transmission line needs series or shunt compensation for power flow control as well as for mitigating the SSR phenomenon. An idea of this paper is to damp SSR by adding static synchronous series compensator (SSSC, Series device) or Static compensator (STATCOM, Shunt device). This paper shows that damping characteristics obtained by SSSC is better than STATCOM for damping SSR phenomenon. The results are obtained by modelling a lineralized system in MATLAB and study is performed on the system adapted from the IEEE first bench mark model for Eigen value analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6450474/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291460","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of damping subsynchronous resonance using SSSC and STATCOM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of damping subsynchronous resonance using SSSC and STATCOM","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"Paper110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043672S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6421217","isNumber":"6450364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6421217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6450364","articleId":"6450474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6450476,"authors":[{"name":"Mini S.

For maximum power point tracking artificial intelligent tools such as artificial neural network (ANN) is used. In this proposed system two control algorithms is applied simultaneously to get maximum power at output end. The complete system efficiency is obtained.

To overcome the problem due to harmonics, Active Power Filters (APFs) are used with various control schemes. But Hybrid Active power filter is a power electronic device which has both the characteristics of passive power filters and active power filters, helps in cancellation of the harmonics by producing compensating signal.

However, the proposed algorithm uses the instantaneous phase voltages only. Hence, the complexity will be reduced. Moreover, the proposed approach gives the realization of various carrier based PWM algorithms that include both space vector PWM (SVPWM) and various discontinuous PWM (DPWM) algorithms by using a generalized control algorithm and is obtained via unequal sharing of zero states. In the proposed approach, by varying a constant (k ) value from zero to one, various DPWM algorithms can be generated along with the SVPWM algorithm under both the linear and over modulation regions. To validate the proposed GPWM algorithm, several numerical simulation studies have been carried out and the results have been presented. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IICPE.2012.6450523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IICPE.2012.6450523","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 5th India International Conference on Power Electronics (IICPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6421217/6450364/06450523.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 5th India International Conference on Power Electronics (IICPE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized PWM algorithm for VSI fed induction motor drives using the only sampled reference phase voltages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Generalized PWM algorithm for VSI fed induction motor drives using the only sampled reference phase voltages","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450523/","accessionNumber":"13308034","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450523/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized PWM algorithm for VSI fed induction motor drives using the only sampled reference phase voltages","confLoc":"Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"Paper159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056559S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6421217","isNumber":"6450364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6421217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6450364","articleId":"6450523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6450554,"authors":[{"name":"Sourav Nath","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Gangtok, India"],"firstName":"Sourav","lastName":"Nath","id":"38546723600"},{"name":"Chandrajit Pal","affiliation":["A.K Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Chandrajit","lastName":"Pal","id":"38243892900"},{"name":"Suman Sau","affiliation":["A.K Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Sau","id":"38232207100"},{"name":"Sreyanka Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Surendra Institute of Engineering and Management, Siliguri, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sreyanka","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"38547914700"},{"name":"Abhishek Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Surendra Institute of Engineering and Management, Siliguri, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Roy","id":"38547474300"},{"name":"Arghya Guchhait","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Surendra Institute of Engineering and Management, Siliguri, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Arghya","lastName":"Guchhait","id":"37938439000"},{"name":"Debdatta Kandar","affiliation":["Department of CSE, SKP Engineering College, Thiruvannamalai, India"],"firstName":"Debdatta","lastName":"Kandar","id":"37394779500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2756-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2757-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6450554","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Junctions","Roads","Estimation","Educational institutions","Simulation","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based intelligence traffic light controller design","VHDL","traffic lights","traffic lamps","traffic signals","stop-and-go lights robots","semaphore","signaling devices","road intersections","pedestrian crossings","traffic flow control","collision avoidance","hazards","traffic control systems","warnings","microcontroller","ASIC design","TLC design","FSM","finite state machine","FPGA design implementation","advanced traffic light controller system","Xilinx Spartan 3E","Virtex 5 FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Xilinx","VHDL","VLSI","TLC(Traffic Light Controller)"]}],"abstract":"Traffic lights, which may also be known as stoplights, traffic lamps, traffic signals, stop-and-go lights robots or semaphore are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings and other locations to control competing flows of traffic[1]. Traffic lights assign the right of way to road users by the use of lights in standard colors. Traffic light controller establishes a set of rules and instructions that drivers, pilots, train engineers, and ship captains rely on to avoid collisions and other hazards. Traffic control systems include signs, lights and other devices that communicate specific directions, warnings, or requirements. Traffic light controller (TLC) has been implemented using microcontroller, FPGA, and ASIC design. FPGA has many advantages over microcontroller, some of these advantages are; the speed, number of input/output ports and performance which are all very important in TLC design, at the same time ASIC design is more expensive than FPGA. Most of the TLCs implemented on FPGA are simple ones that have been implemented as examples of FSM(Finite State Machine). This paper concerned with an FPGA design implementation of a low cost 24-hour advanced traffic light controller system. The system has been successfully tested and implemented in hardware using Xilinx Spartan 3E and Virtex 5 FPGA. But the sensor and camera interfacing(which remains as future scope) is not done yet, manually the data corresponding to the sensors were given. The system has many advantages over the exciting TLC's on most of the parts of the world[2].","doi":"10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450554","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Radar, Communication and Computing (ICRCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Radar, Communication and Computing (ICRCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422826/6450525/06450554.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450525","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an FPGA based intelligence traffic light controller with VHDL","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of an FPGA based intelligence traffic light controller with VHDL","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450554/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291628","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450554/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an FPGA based intelligence traffic light controller with VHDL","confLoc":"Tiruvannamalai, India","sourcePdf":"IB12194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103435S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422826","isNumber":"6450525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422826","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6450525","articleId":"6450554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450556,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Data access Control isan efficient way for guaranteeing the data security. Data access cannot be controlled safely and efficiently, unless access decision takes semantic relationship among different entities in the access control domain. Accessdecisions made with considering entities in isolation, rather than taking their interrelationships into account may result in security violations. Traditional access control models like MAC, DAC, RBAC fails to consider interrelationships among access control entities. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Based AccessControl model, which considers relationships among the entities in all domains of access control namely Subject(user), Object(Data/resource), Action(select, open, read, write) and so on. We also had shown how to reduce the semantic interrelationships into subsumption problem. This reduction facilitates the propagation of policies in these domains and also enhances time and space complexity of access control mechanisms.","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Radar, Communication and Computing (ICRCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Radar, Communication and Computing (ICRCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422826/6450525/06450570.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A semantic-based access control for ensuring data security in cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A semantic-based access control for ensuring data security in cloud computing","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308081","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6450570/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semantic-based access control for ensuring data security in cloud computing","confLoc":"Tiruvannamalai, India","sourcePdf":"IE01143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06623S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422826","isNumber":"6450525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422826","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6450525","articleId":"6450570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6450579,"authors":[{"name":"R.

High PAPR is one of the critical problems in OFDM modulation. There are large numbers of techniques for reduction of PAPR. Selections of any method depend on PAPR Reduction performance, Data Rate loss and transmit signal power increase, Increased BER at the Receiver and computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient technique is evaluated to reduce the PAPR by making combination of the Clipping with Amplification method. Clipping can be performed in two ways- one is to clip the complex envelopes of OFDM signal and the other is to clip the In-phase (I-signal) and Quadrature phase (Q-signal) independently. Above two methods are implemented with the result that clipping the complex envelope method gives significant reduction in PAPR than clipping the In-phase (1-signal) and Quadrature phase (Q-signal) separately.","doi":"10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450597","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Radar, Communication and Computing (ICRCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Radar, Communication and Computing (ICRCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422826/6450525/06450597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450525","startPage":"289","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of PAPR Reduction method in OFDM with Clipping & Amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of PAPR Reduction method in OFDM with Clipping & Amplification","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450597/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308085","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6450597/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of PAPR Reduction method in OFDM with Clipping & Amplification","confLoc":"Tiruvannamalai, India","sourcePdf":"IH02158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037583S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422826","isNumber":"6450525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422826","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6450525","articleId":"6450597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450614,"authors":[{"name":"Kamil Rezer","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik, Technology University Hamburg-Harhurg, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Rezer","id":"37594088000"},{"name":"Arne F.

We investigate here two types of stepped frequency waveforms, the coherent frequency bursts and successive frequency ramps, which can be used for high resolution range profiling. Compared to more conventional chirps, the advantage of these waveforms would be a reduction in the receiver instantaneous bandwidth. If the Doppler performance of these waveforms can be improved, they could be used for detection and classification of respectively fast and slow moving targets. We demonstrate that applying CS in range by reducing the number of transmitted frequencies results in an increase in either Doppler resolution or Doppler unambiguous domain. Furthermore, the Doppler improvement is proportional to the range compression factor.","publicationTitle":"2012 9th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423297/6450609/06450619.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for high resolution profiles with enhanced Doppler performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2012-Nov. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450619/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for high resolution profiles with enhanced Doppler performance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290318","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450619/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for high resolution profiles with enhanced Doppler performance","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064718S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2012-Nov. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423297","isNumber":"6450609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423297","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6450609","articleId":"6450619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450630,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Chernyak","affiliation":["Moscow Aviation Institute, National Research University, Russia"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Chernyak","id":"37360060700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2471-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6450630","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","MIMO radar","Object detection","Fluctuations","Doppler effect","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","MIMO radar","radar clutter","radar detection","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving target detection","radar clutter","multisite radar systems","MSRS","MIMO radars","receiver self-noise","uncorrelated clutter echo fluctuations","receiving stations","target Doppler frequency dependence","system geometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MSRS","MIMO radars","clutter","target detection"]}],"abstract":"Multisite Radar Systems (MSRSs) consisting of MIMO radars have important advantages for target detection not only in a background of receiver self-noises but in clutter too.

Hence, it is possible to obtain a sparse representation of the original radar signal. Contrary to conventional matched filters, absolute amplitude information become available for radar signal processing.

For the extension of its range-Doppler estimation functionality, a third dimension of estimation, namely the position of objects in the azimuth plane is considered. Popular subspace-based DOA methods such as MUSIC have been explored, however they required a large processing effort. This added to the latency of the radar processing and thus is deemed to be sub-optimal for real time target localization applications. This paper presents a simulation-based investigation of using ANN for DOA estimation. The results showed that the ANN based algorithm requires less processing time and outperforms the MUSIC algorithm in terms of object separability at the separation angle of less than 5\u00b0.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423297/6450609/06450703.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"2012 9th European Radar Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450609","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based direction of arrival estimation for a MIMO OFDM radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","OFDM","Radar","Neurons","Direction of arrival estimation","Estimation","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","neural nets","OFDM modulation","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction of arrival estimation","MIMO OFDM radar","artificial neural networks","DOA estimation","range-Doppler estimation functionality","subspace-based DOA methods","MUSIC","radar processing","real time target localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2012-Nov. 2 2012","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based direction of arrival estimation for a MIMO OFDM radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450703/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290391","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based direction of arrival estimation for a MIMO OFDM radar","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043697S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2012-Nov. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423297","isNumber":"6450609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423297","xplore-issue":"6450609","articleId":"6450703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450704,"authors":[{"name":"Johanna Guetlein","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schooltungen, Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Johanna","lastName":"Guetlein","id":"37398643500"},{"name":"Sebastian Bertl","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schooltungen, Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Bertl","id":"37299870100"},{"name":"Andreas Kirschner","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schooltungen, Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kirschner","id":"37885685700"},{"name":"Juergen Detlefsen","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schooltungen, Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Detlefsen","id":"37301144300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2471-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6450704","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":538},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Transmitters","Arrays","Azimuth","Receivers","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","FM radar","MIMO radar","radar receivers","radar transmitters","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching scheme","FMCW-MIMO radar","orthogonal waveforms","hardware cost","time multiplexing","azimuth focusing","interlaced switching"]}],"abstract":"For MIMO radar systems orthogonal waveforms are required to distinguish between the different transmitted signals at the different receivers.

As the implementation is carried out on a field programmable gate array with a fixed-point number representation, we state manageable design equations that can be used to configure the algorithm in order to achieve the desired performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio.","publicationTitle":"2012 9th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423297/6450609/06450742.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time implementation of an imaging algorithm for FMCW MIMO radar systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2012-Nov. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450742/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time implementation of an imaging algorithm for FMCW MIMO radar systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290427","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450742/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time implementation of an imaging algorithm for FMCW MIMO radar systems","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043372S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2012-Nov. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423297","isNumber":"6450609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423297","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6450609","articleId":"6450742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6450752,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The OCCS network may suffer from the free riding problem where members are selfish and will only want to use services on the platform without ever contributing resources. It may also suffer from resource wastage from members or external entities trying to attack the system so that genuine users are deprived of valuable resources. The purpose of this paper is to design incentive schemes that will encourage the contribution of resources to the OCCS platform as well as the efficient usage of these resources. We employ game theory and mechanism design to model and design the incentive schemes. We present two game models and show the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for both the cooperative and non-cooperative games. Three base incentive schemes are presented and two advanced schemes one based on discount factor and the other a stochastic scheme are also presented. We perform analytical evaluation of our incentive schemes and conclude that the schemes meet the desired properties of budget-balance, ex-post individual rationality, incentive compatibility, allocative efficiency, robustness, and flexible to accommodate changing user behavior on the platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415460/6450881/06450900.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom)","doi":"10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6450881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6450900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive mechanisms for Opportunistic Cloud Computing Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability engineering","Reliability theory","Robustness","Mechanical factors","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","game theory","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive mechanism","opportunistic cloud computing service","OCCS","social network","resource wastage","game theory","Nash equilibrium","noncooperative game","discount factor","stochastic scheme","budget-balance","incentive compatibility","allocative efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["game theory","mechanism design","opportunistic cloud computing services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6450900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Incentive mechanisms for Opportunistic Cloud Computing Services","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6450900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291192","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive mechanisms for Opportunistic Cloud Computing Services","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"mainmatter0127kuada.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127348S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415460","isNumber":"6450881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415460","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6450881","articleId":"6450900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6450980,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Norouzi Fard","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farzad Norouzi","lastName":"Fard","id":"38548224500"},{"name":"Ali Broumandnia","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Broumandnia","id":"37541450700"},{"name":"Sasan Mohammadi","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sasan","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37533979200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4772-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4770-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4771-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6450980","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed image processing scheduling in heterogeneous computing network systems","abstract":"A decretive concern in distributed computing systems is to efficiently schedule the tasks among all processors so that the overall processing time of the submitted tasks is at a minimum.

This is due to the high implementation complexity of their decoding algorithms, even those that compromise performance for the sake of simplicity. In this paper, we present three algorithms based on stochastic computation to reduce the decoding complexity. The first is a purely stochastic algorithm with error-correcting performance matching that of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) for LDPC codes over Galois fields with low order and a small variable node degree. We also present a modified version which reduces the number of decoding iterations required while remaining purely stochastic and having a low per-iteration complexity. The second algorithm, relaxed half-stochastic (RHS) decoding, combines elements of the SPA and the stochastic decoder and uses successive relaxation to match the error-correcting performance of the SPA. Furthermore, it uses fewer iterations than the purely stochastic algorithm and does not have limitations on the field order and variable node degree of the codes it can decode. The third algorithm, NoX, is a fully stochastic specialization of RHS for codes with a variable node degree 2 that offers similar performance, but at a significantly lower computational complexity. We study the performance and complexity of the algorithms; noting that all have lower per-iteration complexity than SPA and that RHS can have comparable average per-codeword computational complexity, and NoX a lower one.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012913.110340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6507371/06451069.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012913.110340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Decoding of LDPC Codes over GF(q)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Decoding of LDPC Codes over GF(q)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451069/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13474331","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6451069/","volume":"61","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Decoding of LDPC Codes over GF(q)","sourcePdf":"0939-tc1303-gabi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085665S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6507371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6507371","articleId":"6451069","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6451071,"authors":[{"name":"Saif Khan Mohammed","affiliation":["Communication Systems Division, Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6507371/6451071/6451071-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saif Khan Mohammed (S'08-M'11) received the B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (I.I.T.), New Delhi, India, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree from the Electrical and Communication Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2010.

The motivation for this is that CE signals facilitate the use of power-efficient RF power amplifiers. Analytical and numerical results show that, under certain mild conditions on the channel gains, for a fixed M, an array gain is achievable even under the stringent per-antenna CE constraint. Essentially, for a fixed M, at sufficiently large N the total transmitted power can be reduced with increasing N while maintaining a fixed information rate to each user. Simulations for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel show that the total transmit power can be reduced linearly with increasing N (i.e., an O(N) array gain). We also propose a precoding scheme which finds near-optimal CE signals to be transmitted, and has O(MN) complexity. Also, in terms of the total transmit power required to achieve a fixed desired information sum-rate, despite the stringent per-antenna CE constraint, the proposed CE precoding scheme performs close to the sum-capacity achieving scheme for an average-only total transmit power constrained channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","volume":"61","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13457562","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451071/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Per-Antenna Constant Envelope Precoding for Large Multi-User MIMO Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-Antenna Constant Envelope Precoding for Large Multi-User MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1059-tc1303-saif.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064059S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6507371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"6507371","articleId":"6451071","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6451072,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoung-Jin Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6451072/6451072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyoung-Jin Lim received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Gyungbuk, Korea, in 2006 and 2012, respectively.

Based on a second-price auction mechanism, the primary users independently conduct auctions to determine winners who are then granted access to leased bands and prices for those bands. Before auctions, each secondary user jointly chooses bands which they want to lease and generates bids for those bands with a limited transmit power budget. To this end, we determine the feasibility conditions for band selection and for power and time allocation. Further, we propose a low complexity bidding algorithm that iteratively selects a band and calculates the bid for that band. For the paying price among winners after auctions, a multi-objective optimization problem is considered. We derive Pareto optimal solutions and propose paying schemes that prioritize the objectives with pre-defined weighting rules. In addition, the payment and secondary utility are investigated with regard to the number of winners. Simulation results show that secondary users achieve significantly increased utility as more winners are chosen, while primary users are guaranteed a non-negative benefit from spectrum leasing. The power consumed by the secondary users for cooperative transmission is compared for the proposed paying schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","volume":"61","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13487662","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6451072/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation-Based Dynamic Spectrum Leasing via Multi-Winner Auction of Multiple Bands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation-Based Dynamic Spectrum Leasing via Multi-Winner Auction of Multiple Bands","sourcePdf":"1254-tc1304-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081128S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6451072","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6451074,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6451074/6451074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Li (M'09) received his Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, P.

In contrast, in this paper a novel precoding technique is devised to exploit a particular property of the information source rather than the channel. Specifically, we focus on the scenario where the source sequence has an inherent correlation that is known a priori, and design a precoding filter that attempts to reduce the average power of the resulting transmit symbol sequences. The proposed precoding technique is thus termed power-reductive precoding (PRP). This reduction of average transmit power accrues without changing the amplitude of the original sequence and thus can be treated as a system gain. An apparent drawback of this approach is the intentional ISI introduced by the precoding filter, which may lessen the minimum distance among legitimate sequences. Nevertheless, we show that even if the loss associated with the minimum distance penalty is properly taken into account, the achievable error rate versus SNR can be made superior to the case without precoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451077/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487666","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power-Reductive Precoding for the Transmission of Correlated Information Sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Reductive Precoding for the Transmission of Correlated Information Sequences","sourcePdf":"1393-tc1304-tanah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063831S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6451077","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6451090,"authors":[{"name":"Betul Erdogdu Sakar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Programming, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Betul Erdogdu","lastName":"Sakar","id":"37070566200"},{"name":"M.

For this purpose, we have collected a wide variety of voice samples, including sustained vowels, words, and sentences compiled from a set of speaking exercises for people with Parkinson's disease. There are two main issues in learning from such a dataset that consists of multiple speech recordings per subject: 1) How predictive these various types, e.g., sustained vowels versus words, of voice samples are in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis? 2) How well the central tendency and dispersion metrics serve as representatives of all sample recordings of a subject? In this paper, investigating our Parkinson dataset using well-known machine learning tools, as reported in the literature, sustained vowels are found to carry more PD-discriminative information. We have also found that rather than using each voice recording of each subject as an independent data sample, representing the samples of a subject with central tendency and dispersion metrics improves generalization of the predictive model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13786004","pubMedId":"25055311","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6451090/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Collection and Analysis of a Parkinson Speech Dataset With Multiple Types of Sound Recordings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collection and Analysis of a Parkinson Speech Dataset With Multiple Types of Sound Recordings","sourcePdf":"jbhi-kursun-2245674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072785S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6549132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"257","xplore-issue":"6549132","articleId":"6451090","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6451093,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Radiation tests are done on RE-doped fiber samples in order to measure and assess the values of the principal input parameters requested by the simulation tool based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. The proposed simulation procedure is validated by comparing the calculation results with the measured degradations of two amplifiers made with standard and RH RE-doped optical fibers, respectively. After validation, the numerical code is used to theoretically investigate the influence of some amplifier design parameters on its sensitivity to radiations. Simulations show that the RE-doped fiber length used in the amplifier needs to be adjusted to optimize the amplifier performance over the whole space mission profile rather than to obtain the maximal amplification efficiency before its integration in the harsh environment. By combining this coupled approach with the newly-developed RH RE-doped fibers, fiber-based amplifiers nearly insensitive to space environment may be designed in the future.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2245304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2245304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461949","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1254","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6461949/06451093.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451093","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Ions","Erbium","Radiation effects","Optical fiber testing","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","optical fibre amplifiers","particle swarm optimisation","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifier design","numerical code","particle swarm optimization","simulation tool","principal input parameters","radiation tests","radiation-hardened rare earth doped fiber amplifiers design","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifiers","erbium","optical fibers","particle swarm optimization","radiation effects","rare-earth ions","ytterbium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of Radiation-Hardened Rare-Earth Doped Amplifiers Through a Coupled Experiment/Simulation Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13551619","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451093/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451093/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Radiation-Hardened Rare-Earth Doped Amplifiers Through a Coupled Experiment/Simulation Approach","sourcePdf":"jlt-girard-2245304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101126S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6461949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6461949","articleId":"6451093","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":6451097,"authors":[{"name":"Haizhou Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6504474/6451097/6451097-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haizhou Li (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 1984, 1987, and 1990, respectively.","Currently, he is the Principal Scientist and Department Head of Human Language Technology, Co-Director of Baidu-I2R Research Centre, Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, technology, and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.

This paper investigates the use of a transmit-only mechanism for data transfer in wireless body area network (WBAN) applications. A transmit-only medium access control mechanism that can be used in low-power WBANs is developed. Detailed attention is given to the simulation-based analysis of collisions between data which occur in such a scheme. A performance enhancement scheme is suggested to achieve optimum data transmission. Results are validated using a hardware implementation of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2245562","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6486560/06451102.pdf","startPage":"1949","endPage":"1958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2245562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6486560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit-Only Ultra Wide Band Body Sensors and Collision Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Transmit-Only Ultra Wide Band Body Sensors and Collision Analysis","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13411728","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451102/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit-Only Ultra Wide Band Body Sensors and Collision Analysis","sourcePdf":"jsen-yuce-2245562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082589S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6486560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6486560","articleId":"6451102","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451110,"authors":[{"name":"Haitao Liu","affiliation":["Qian Xuesen Laboratory of Space Technology, China AeroSpace Science and Technology Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537717900"},{"name":"Steven Gao","affiliation":["Surrey Space Centre, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Gao","id":"37536096300"},{"name":"Tian Hong Loh","affiliation":["Communication Technologies Group, Time, Quantum and Electromagnetics Division, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK"],"firstName":"Tian Hong","lastName":"Loh","id":"37308049000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6451110","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2613},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna measurements","MIMO","Voltage control","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","beam steering","channel capacity","MIMO communication","monopole antenna arrays","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact MIMO antenna","adaptive radiation pattern","frequency-reconfigurable antenna","multiple-input multiple-output system","electronically steerable radiation pattern","azimuth plane","steerable radiation pattern","channel capacity","folded-monopole electronically steerable parasitic array radiator","FM-ESPAR antenna","top-disk loaded monopole","folded monopole","ground plane","electronically steerable beam","frequency-agile capability","frequency 2.3 GHz to 2.6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam steering","dynamic radiation pattern diversity (DRPD)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","small antenna","spatial correlation"]}],"abstract":"A frequency-reconfigurable antenna for a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with electronically steerable radiation patterns in azimuth plane is proposed in this letter. For MIMO systems, the steerable radiation patterns are able to reduce the correlation between signals and increase the channel capacity. There are two folded-monopole electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (FM-ESPAR) antennas in the proposed MIMO antenna system in this letter. The radiation pattern of each FM-ESPAR antenna is steerable in azimuth plane from 0 to 360 . Its frequency is reconfigurable between 2.3 and 2.6 GHz. A top-disk loaded monopole and folded monopoles are employed to reduce the height of each FM-ESPAR antenna to 12 mm (\u03bb/10 at 2.4 GHz). The FM-ESPAR antennas are separated from each other by using a 30-mm-long sleeve ground plane. The measured results confirm that the MIMO antenna comprising two FM-ESPAR antennas achieves good isolation at any angle between the main lobes of the FM-ESPAR antennas.

In this letter, we first propose a bag-of-features (BOF) model-based classification framework for high-resolution remote-sensing images via Earth mover's distance (EMD) to perform histogram matching. Compared with conventional BOF, EMD-based BOF is insensitive to vector quantization and can explore the relations among visual codes. In addition, such relations can be utilized as a key discriminative feature for image classification task. However, EMD is not practically utilized because of expensive computational cost. Motivated by Pele and Werman, we propose a faster approximate EMD (AEMD), and our AEMD-based BOF can inherit the advantages of EMD.

With the estimated DOAs and the covariance matrix of the sparse array, the far-field and near-field sources are identified and the range parameters of near-field sources are also obtained by defining the range spectrum.

The approach is based on creating two cavities corresponding to two operating frequency bands that combine to form a single wide band of operation. The RCA design is discussed in a methodological manner to determine the thicknesses of the superstrates, the separation distance between them, and the separation distance to the ground plane. We show that the proposed technique is capable of enhancing the bandwidth from 9% of the single superstrate RCA to 17.9% of the two superstrate RCA, with only 0.1-dB reduction of the maximum directivity (17.5 dBi). The presented design method can be replicated for any RCA with any directivity level and type of primary feeding. The performance of the analytically designed antenna is validated by simulation using commercial numerical electromagnetics software.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2231931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6493420/06451153.pdf","startPage":"1898","endPage":"1908","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2231931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Enhancement of the Resonant Cavity Antenna by Using Two Dielectric Superstrates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Enhancement of the Resonant Cavity Antenna by Using Two Dielectric Superstrates","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6451153/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413094","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Enhancement of the Resonant Cavity Antenna by Using Two Dielectric Superstrates","sourcePdf":"tap-anagnostou-2231931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08371S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6493420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6493420","articleId":"6451153","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6451154,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie L.

Traditionally, the equalization (or room correction) problem has been treated primarily by single-channel methods, where loudspeaker input signals are prefiltered individually by separate scalar filters. Single-channel methods are generally able to improve the average spectral flatness of the acoustic transfer functions in a listening region, but they cannot reduce the variability of the transfer functions within the region. Most modern audio reproduction systems, however, contain two or more loudspeakers, and in this paper we aim at improving the equalization performance by using all available loudspeakers jointly. To this end we propose a polynomial based MIMO formulation of the equalization problem. The new approach, which is a generalization of an earlier single-channel approach by the authors, is found to reduce the average reproduction error and the transfer function variability over a region in space. Moreover, pre-ringing artifacts are avoided, and the reproduction error below 1000 Hz is significantly reduced with an amount that scales with the number of loudspeakers used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of Loudspeaker\u2013Room Responses in a Robust MIMO Control Framework","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2245650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6472052/06451160.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2245650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472052","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of Loudspeaker\u2013Room Responses in a Robust MIMO Control Framework","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6451160/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13355082","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of Loudspeaker\u2013Room Responses in a Robust MIMO Control Framework","sourcePdf":"tasl-brannmark-2245650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100851S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6472052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6472052","articleId":"6451160","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6451168,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Bonnin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6567958/6451168/6451168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Bonnin received the Laurea degree in physics from the University of Turin, Italy, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and communication engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","From 2007 to 2011 he was research associate with the Department of Electronics of Politecnico di Torino.

Traditional approaches describe the phase noise problem as a purely diffusive process. In this paper we develop a novel phase model reduction technique for phase noise analysis of nonlinear oscillators subject to stochastic inputs. We obtain analytical equations for both the phase deviation and the probability density function of the phase deviation. We show that, in general, the phase reduced models include non Markovian terms. Under the Markovian assumption, we demonstrate that the effect of white noise is to generate both phase diffusion and a frequency shift, i.e. phase noise is best described as a convection-diffusion process. The analysis of a solvable model shows the accuracy of our theory, and that it gives better predictions than traditional phase models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","volume":"60","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"13786052","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6451168/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Phase Noise and Noise Induced Frequency Shift in Stochastic Nonlinear Oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Noise and Noise Induced Frequency Shift in Stochastic Nonlinear Oscillators","sourcePdf":"tcsi-bonnin-2239131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086246S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6567958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6567958","articleId":"6451168","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6451174,"authors":[{"name":"Seon-Ju Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Seon-Ju Ahn (S'04\u2013M'09) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002, 2004, and 2009, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Myongji University, Korea, and FREEDM System Center, NC State University, Raleigh.

The objective is to minimize the fuel cost during the grid-connected operation, while ensuring stable operation after islanding. To achieve this goal, the economic dispatch (ED) problem and related constraints are formulated. The constraints considered in this study are: i) reserve for variation in load demand, ii) reserve for variation in the power outputs of non-dispatchable DGs, iii) flow limits between two adjacent areas, and iv) reserve for the stable islanded operation. The first three constraints, which have been employed in ED problem for conventional power systems, are modified to apply to Microgrids. We also provide a detailed formulation of the constraint for stable islanded operation in accordance with two power-sharing principles: i) fixed droop and ii) adjustable droop. The problem is solved using a modified direct search method, and the effect of the constraints on the operational cost is investigated via numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Scheduling of Distributed Generators for Economic and Stable Operation of a Microgrid","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2233773","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6471805/06451174.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2233773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Power Scheduling of Distributed Generators for Economic and Stable Operation of a Microgrid","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6451174/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355367","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Scheduling of Distributed Generators for Economic and Stable Operation of a Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tsg-ahn-2233773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088515S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6451174","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6451177,"authors":[{"name":"Ruofei Ma","affiliation":["Communications Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6471805/6451177/6451177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruofei Ma received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in information and communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

The SG integrates electrical grids and communication infrastructures and forms an intelligent electricity network working with all connected components to deliver sustainable electricity supplies. Many advanced communication technologies have been identified for SG applications with a potential to significantly enhance the overall efficiency of power grids. In this paper, the challenges and applications of communication technologies in SG are discussed. In particular, we identify three major challenges to implement SG communication systems, including standards interoperability, cognitive access to unlicensed radio spectra, and cyber security. The issues to implement SG communications on an evolutional path and its future trends are also addressed. The aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art researches on SG communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6471805/06451177.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2225851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2225851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Grid Communication: Its Challenges and Opportunities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sun","Electricity","Monitoring","Standards","Smart grids","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","open systems","power engineering computing","security of data","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart grid communication","electrical grids","communication infrastructures","intelligent electricity network","sustainable electricity supplies","advanced communication technologies","power grid efficiency","SG communication systems","interoperability","cognitive access","unlicensed radio spectra","cyber security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","smart grid communication","smart utility network","wireless sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Smart Grid Communication: Its Challenges and Opportunities","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6451177/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355369","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Grid Communication: Its Challenges and Opportunities","sourcePdf":"tsg-chen-2225851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073923S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6451177","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451179,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Ghelardoni","affiliation":["DITEN, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Luca Ghelardoni was born in Genova, Italy, in 1984.

However, decentralized inverter control suffers from a limited system stability mainly because of the lack of communications among different inverters. In this paper, we investigate stability enhancement of the droop based decentralized inverter control in microgrids. Specifically, we propose a power sharing based control strategy which incorporates the information of the total real and reactive power generation of all DG units. The information is acquired by a wireless network (such as a WiFi, ZigBee, and/or cellular communication network) in a decentralized manner. Based on the desired power sharing of each DG unit and the acquired information of total generation, additional control terms are added to the traditional droop controller. We evaluate the performance of the proposed control strategy based on small-signal stability analysis. As timely communication may not be established for a microgrid with low-cost wireless communication devices, two kinds of analytical models are developed with respect to negligible and nonnegligible communication delays, respectively. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the system stability under the proposed control strategy with respect to different.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2226064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6471805/06451180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2226064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471805","startPage":"321","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Enhancement of Decentralized Inverter Control Through Wireless Communications in Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability Enhancement of Decentralized Inverter Control Through Wireless Communications in Microgrids","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355372","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451180/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Enhancement of Decentralized Inverter Control Through Wireless Communications in Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-liang-2226064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072839S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6451180","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451222,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Xu","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA","IBM Corporation, Hopewell Junction, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6490033/6451222/6451222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zheng Xu received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 2011.","He is currently with IBM, Hopewell Junction, NY.

The number of stacked integrated circuits, floorplanning of TSVs/micro-solders, operating frequency of 3-D system, characteristics of decoupling capacitance, size of on-chip power grids, parasitics of power wires/vias/solders/TSVs/micro-solders, voltage supply, and waveform parameters of current loads are examined, unveiling several 3-D power delivery design implications.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2235915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6490033/06451222.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2012.2235915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6490033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic-Simulation Program With Integrated Circuit Emphasis Modeling, Analysis, and Design of 3-D Power Delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451222/","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic-Simulation Program With Integrated Circuit Emphasis Modeling, Analysis, and Design of 3-D Power Delivery","volume":"3","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6451222/","publicationDate":"April 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13401471","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic-Simulation Program With Integrated Circuit Emphasis Modeling, Analysis, and Design of 3-D Power Delivery","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-xu-2235915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084914S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6490033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6490033","articleId":"6451222","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6451224,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Jos\u00e9 Torres Fernandes","affiliation":["Polytechnic School, University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6670128/6451224/6451224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bruno Jos\u00e9 Torres Fernandes (M'11) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently working toward the D.Sc. degree.","He is an Assistant Professor with the University of Pernambuco, Recife.

It is through the visual system that we are able to accomplish from the most simple task such as object recognition to the most complex visual interpretation, understanding and perception. Inspired by this sophisticated system, two models based on the properties of the human visual system are proposed. These models are designed based on the concepts of receptive and inhibitory fields. The first model is a pyramidal neural network with lateral inhibition, called lateral inhibition pyramidal neural network. The second proposed model is a supervised image segmentation system, called segmentation and classification based on receptive fields. This work shows that the combination of these two models is beneficial, and the results obtained are better than that of other state-of-the-art

Unfortunately, it never defines what such a signature is. For example, various targets of interest, such as anomalies and endmembers, should be considered as different types of spectrally distinct signatures and have their own different values of VD. Specifically, these targets are insignificant in terms of signal energies due to their relatively small populations. Accordingly, their contributions to second-order statistics (2OS) are rather limited. In this case, 2OS-based methods such as eigen-approaches to determine VD may not be effective in determining how many such type of signal sources as spectrally distinct signatures are. This paper develops a new theory that expands 2OS-VD theory to a high-order statistics (HOS)-based VD, called HOS-VD theory. Since there is no counterpart of the characteristic polynomial equation used to find eigenvalues in 2OS available for HOS, a direct extension is inapplicable. This paper re-invents a wheel by finding actual targets directly from the data rather than eigenvectors/singular vectors used in 2OS-VD theory which do not represent any real targets in the data. Consequently, comparing to 2OS-VD theory which can only be used to estimate the value of VD without finding real targets, the developed HOS-VD theory can accomplish both of tasks at the same time, i.e., determining the value of VD as well as finding actual targets directly from the data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theory of High-Order Statistics-Based Virtual Dimensionality for Hyperspectral Imagery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2237554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6675821/06451244.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2237554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Theory of High-Order Statistics-Based Virtual Dimensionality for Hyperspectral Imagery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6451244/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13933890","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theory of High-Order Statistics-Based Virtual Dimensionality for Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-chang-2237554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122307S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6675821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6675821","articleId":"6451244","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451247,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6675821/6451247/6451247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Hung Lin (M'12) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and information engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1998 and 2004, respectively.","Since 2006, he has been a Member of the faculty of the Department of Geomatics, National Cheng Kung University, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Thus, information reconstruction of cloud-contaminated images generally plays an important role in image analysis. This paper proposes a novel method to reconstruct cloud-contaminated information in multitemporal remote sensing images. Based on the concept of utilizing temporal correlation of multitemporal images, we propose a patch-based information reconstruction algorithm that spatiotemporally segments a sequence of images into clusters containing several spatially connected components called patches and then clones information from cloud-free and high-similarity patches to their corresponding cloud-contaminated patches. In addition, a seam that passes through homogenous regions is used in information reconstruction to reduce radiometric inconsistency, and information cloning is solved using an optimization process with the determined seam. These processes enable the proposed method to well reconstruct missing information. Qualitative analyses of image sequences acquired by a Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor and a quantitative analysis of simulated data with various cloud contamination conditions are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to related methods in terms of radiometric accuracy and consistency, particularly for large clouds in a heterogeneous landscape.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6675821/06451247.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2237408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2237408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch-Based Information Reconstruction of Cloud-Contaminated Multitemporal Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Clouds","Boundary conditions","Optimization","Cloning","Image segmentation","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clouds","data analysis","geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image reconstruction","optimisation","radiometry","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical remote sensing images","data analysis","cloud-contaminated multitemporal image reconstruction","image analysis","cloud-contaminated information reconstruction","multitemporal remote sensing images","temporal correlation","patch-based information reconstruction algorithm","spatiotemporally segments","image sequence","spatially connected components","cloud-free high-similarity patches","cloud-contaminated patches","homogenous regions","radiometric inconsistency","information cloning","optimization process","missing information","Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor","quantitative analysis","cloud contamination conditions","radiometric accuracy","radiometric consistency","heterogeneous landscape","patch-based information reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud removal","image reconstruction","Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)","Poisson equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Patch-Based Information Reconstruction of Cloud-Contaminated Multitemporal Images","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6451247/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13933896","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch-Based Information Reconstruction of Cloud-Contaminated Multitemporal Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lin-2237408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071402S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6675821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6675821","articleId":"6451247","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6451248,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6675821/6451248/6451248-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiqiang Xiao received the Ph.D. degree in geophysical prospecting and information technology from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2004.","From 2004 to 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.

As a result of cloud contamination and other factors, these LAI products are spatially and temporally discontinuous and are also inaccurate for some vegetation types in many areas. A better strategy is to use multi-temporal data. In this paper, a method was developed to estimate LAI from time-series remote sensing data using general regression neural networks (GRNNs). A database was generated from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and CYCLOPES LAI products as well as MODIS reflectance products of the BELMANIP sites during the period from 2001-2003. The effective CYCLOPES LAI was first converted to true LAI, which was then combined with the MODIS LAI according to their uncertainties determined from the ground-measured true LAI. The MODIS reflectance was reprocessed to remove remaining effects. GRNNs were then trained over the fused LAI and reprocessed MODIS reflectance for each biome type to retrieve LAI from time-series remote sensing data. The reprocessed MODIS reflectance data from an entire year were inputted into the GRNNs to estimate the 1-year LAI profiles. Extensive validations for all biome types were carried out, and it was demonstrated that the method is able to estimate temporally continuous LAI profiles with much improved accuracy compared with that of the current MODIS and CYCLOPES LAI products. This new method is being used to produce the Global Land Surface Satellite LAI products in China.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2237780","startPage":"209","endPage":"223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6675821/06451248.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2237780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of General Regression Neural Networks for Generating the GLASS Leaf Area Index Product From Time-Series MODIS Surface Reflectance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MODIS","Neural networks","Remote sensing","Indexes","Biological system modeling","Vegetation mapping","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general regression neural networks","GLASS leaf area index product","time-series MODIS surface reflectance","cloud contamination","LAI products","multitemporal data","time-series remote sensing data","Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer","CYCLOPES LAI products","MODIS reflectance products","BELMANIP sites","AD 2001 to 2003","time-series remote sensing data","LAI profiles","MODIS LAI products","Global Land Surface Satellite","China"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["General regression neural networks (GRNNs)","leaf area index (LAI)","Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)","retrieval","time series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Use of General Regression Neural Networks for Generating the GLASS Leaf Area Index Product From Time-Series MODIS Surface Reflectance","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6451248/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13933886","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of General Regression Neural Networks for Generating the GLASS Leaf Area Index Product From Time-Series MODIS Surface Reflectance","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xiao-2237780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105922S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6675821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"328","xplore-issue":"6675821","articleId":"6451248","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":6451251,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Rezaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6563218/6451251/6451251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamed Rezaee (S'10) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in control engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering with a research focus on multiagent systems, consensus problems, swarm robotics, and formation flying control."]},"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Rezaee","id":"38232549300"},{"name":"Farzaneh Abdollahi","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6563218/6451251/6451251-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Farzaneh Abdollahi (S'98\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 1999, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2008.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with Amirkabir University of Technology and a Research Assistant Professor with Concordia University.

In the virtual structure, each mobile robot is modeled by an electric charge. The mobile robots move toward a circle, and due to repulsive forces between the identical charges, regular polygon formations of the mobile robots will be realized. For swarm formation, a virtual mobile robot is located at the center of the circle, and other mobile robots follow it. In the introduced approach, each mobile robot finds its position in the formation autonomously, and the formation can change automatically in the case of change in the number of the mobile robots. This paper also proposes a technique for avoiding obstacles based on the behavioral structure. In this technique, when a mobile robot gets close to an obstacle, while moving toward its target, a rotational potential field is applied to lead the mobile robot to avoid the obstacle, without locating in local minimum positions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6563218/06451251.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2245612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2245612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6563218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decentralized Cooperative Control Scheme With Obstacle Avoidance for a Team of Mobile Robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Force","Vectors","Collision avoidance","Equations","Clocks","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","decentralised control","electric charge","mobile robots","multi-agent systems","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized cooperative control scheme","obstacle avoidance","mobile robot team","formation control problem","behavioral structures","virtual structures","electric charge","repulsive forces","regular polygon formations","swarm formation","virtual mobile robot","rotational potential field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative control","local minima","mobile robots","multiagent systems","obstacle avoidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Decentralized Cooperative Control Scheme With Obstacle Avoidance for a Team of Mobile Robots","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6451251/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13694117","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decentralized Cooperative Control Scheme With Obstacle Avoidance for a Team of Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tie-abdollahi-2245612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11432S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6563218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"6563218","articleId":"6451251","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6451256,"authors":[{"name":"Joaqu\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Norniella","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Oviedo University, Gijon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6563218/6451256/6451256-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joaqu\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez Norniella was born in Gij\u00f3n, Spain.

The VF space vector is utilized in transformations between stationary and rotating coordinates in VFOC and in obtaining instantaneous power in VF-DPC. The VF space vector is calculated by integrating the grid voltage space vector. This integration is usually performed using a first-order low-pass (LP) (FOLP) filter, which counteracts the saturation and dc-drift problems associated with pure integrators. However, the dynamics of FOLP filters can be enhanced to a great extent. This paper presents a new, simple, and fast integration algorithm for VF-based control methods. Simulations and experimental tests on a VF-DPC-based system showed that the proposed algorithm leads to rapid recoveries after grid voltage sags occur.

CS-based BSNs are expected to significantly enhance the quality of healthcare and improve the ability of prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diseases. However, existing BSNs are still unable to support long-term monitoring in healthcare, as well as providing an energy-efficient low communication burden and inexpensive scheme. Capitalizing on the sparsity of biomedical signals in transfer domains, this paper develops a continuous biomedical signal acquisition system, which explores a sparsification model to find the sparse representation of biomedical signals. The sparsified measurements of signals are wirelessly transmitted to a fusion center through BSNs. Meanwhile, a weighted group sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed to accurately reconstruct the signals at the fusion center. Simulation results show that, on random sampling over BSN, the proposed group sparse algorithm shows good efficiency, strong stability, and robustness.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2013.2245334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6582568/06451260.pdf","startPage":"1764","endPage":"1771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2013.2245334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Continuous Biomedical Signal Acquisition System Based on Compressed Sensing in Body Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451260/","displayDocTitle":"A Continuous Biomedical Signal Acquisition System Based on Compressed Sensing in Body Sensor Networks","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706423","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6451260/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Continuous Biomedical Signal Acquisition System Based on Compressed Sensing in Body Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2245334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090301S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6451260","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451276,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo M.

Expectation propagation generalizes belief propagation (BP) in two ways. First, it can be used with any exponential family distribution over the cliques in the graph. Second, it can impose additional constraints on the marginal distributions. We use this second property to impose pairwise marginal constraints over pairs of variables connected to a check node of the LDPC code's Tanner graph. Thanks to these additional constraints, the Tree-EP marginal estimates for each variable in the graph are more accurate than those provided by BP. We also reformulate the Tree-EP algorithm for the binary erasure channel (BEC) as a peeling-type algorithm (TEP) and we show that the algorithm has the same computational complexity as BP and it decodes a higher fraction of errors. We describe the TEP decoding process by a set of differential equations that represents the expected residual graph evolution as a function of the code parameters. The solution of these equations is used to predict the TEP decoder performance in both the asymptotic regime and the finite-length regimes over the BEC. While the asymptotic threshold of the TEP decoder is the same as the BP decoder for regular and optimized codes, we propose a scaling law for finite-length LDPC codes, which accurately approximates the TEP improved performance and facilitates its optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","volume":"59","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13499501","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451276/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tree-Structure Expectation Propagation for LDPC Decoding Over the BEC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-Structure Expectation Propagation for LDPC Decoding Over the BEC","sourcePdf":"tit-perezcruz-2245494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15199S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6516641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6516641","articleId":"6451276","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6451285,"authors":[{"name":"Ale\u0161 Hace","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6716101/6451285/6451285-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ale\u0161 Hace (S\u201998\u2013A\u201900\u2013M\u201904) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, in 1994, 1998, and 2001, respectively.","In 1994, he joined the Institute of Robotics, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Science, University of Maribor, where he has been an Assistant Professor of automation and robotics since 2006.

It is based on Hall effect sensors that are built within the motor housing. The proposed implementation requires no external sensor that can deteriorate system dynamics and performance. The integrated sensors have been used both for position measurement and external force estimation that are necessary in high-performance bilateral teleoperation. Nevertheless, system perturbation dynamics may always appear in a practical mechatronic system. Therefore, the chattering-free sliding-mode control algorithm is applied that ensures robustness toward the disturbances, and yet is easy to implement. The data acquisition algorithms as well as the control algorithm are implemented by field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in order to provide high control rate that can further increase robustness required for haptic fidelity of the system for scaled teleoperation. The applied algorithms along with the FGPA implementation were validated by the 2-DoF experimental system. It has been shown that the proposed pseudo-sensorless implementation by FPGA provides high bilateral teleoperation performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14032783","htmlLink":"/document/6451285/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-Sensorless High-Performance Bilateral Teleoperation by Sliding-Mode Control and FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-Sensorless High-Performance Bilateral Teleoperation by Sliding-Mode Control and FPGA","sourcePdf":"tmech-franc-2241778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076494S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6716101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6716101","articleId":"6451285","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6451288,"authors":[{"name":"Sasitharan Balasubramaniam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Sasitharan","lastName":"Balasubramaniam","id":"37390884800"},{"name":"Pietro Lio'","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Lio'","id":"37085935443"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1241"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2639"}],"articleNumber":"6451288","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1184},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microorganisms","Antibiotics","Routing","Immune system","Molecular communication","Nanobioscience","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biodiffusion","cell motility","DNA","drug delivery systems","drugs","microorganisms","molecular biophysics","nanomedicine","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop conjugation based bacteria nanonetworks","molecular communication","nanomachines","information exchange","biological mechanism","molecular diffusion","neuronal networks","molecular motors","DNA-based information","chemotaxis-based motility","plasmid delivery","destination node","grid topology shapes","random topology shapes","scale-free topology shapes","multiple source-destination nanonetworks","antibiotics","filters","packet filtering","packet routing","packet addressing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bacteria conjugation","bacteria nanonetworks","nano and molecular communication"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Anti-Bacterial Agents","Bacteria","Bacteria","Bacteria","Cell Communication","Chemotactic Factors","Communication","Computer Simulation","Computers, Molecular","Conjugation, Genetic","Entropy","Microbial Interactions","Models, Biological","Models, Molecular","Nanotechnology","Pili, Sex","Plasmids","Plasmids"]}],"abstract":"Molecular communication is a new paradigm for nanomachines to exchange information, by utilizing biological mechanism and/or components to transfer information (e.g., molecular diffusion, neuronal networks, molecular motors). One possible approach for molecular communication is through the use of bacteria, which can act as carriers for DNA-based information, i.e., plasmids. This paper analyzes multi-hop molecular nanonetworks that utilize bacteria as a carrier. The proposed approach combines different properties of bacteria to enable multi-hop transmission, such as conjugation and chemotaxis-based motility. Various analyses have been performed, including the correlation between the success rate of plasmid delivery to the destination node, and the role of conjugation in enabling this; as well as analyses on the impact of large topology shapes (e.g., Grid, Random, and Scale-free) on the success rate of plasmid delivery for multiple source-destination nanonetworks. A further solution proposed in this paper is the application of antibiotics to act as filters on illegitimate messages that could be delivered by the bacteria. Our evaluation, which has been conducted through a series of simulations, has shown that numerous bacteria properties fit to properties required for communication networking (e.g., packet filtering, routing, addressing).","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2013.2239657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/6471777/06451288.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2013.2239657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471777","startPage":"47","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Hop Conjugation Based Bacteria Nanonetworks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Hop Conjugation Based Bacteria Nanonetworks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355518","pubMedId":"23392386","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451288/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Hop Conjugation Based Bacteria Nanonetworks","sourcePdf":"tnb-balasubramaniam-2239657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075251S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"6471777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6471777","articleId":"6451288","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451289,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Tung Chou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/6521435/6451289/6451289-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Tung Chou received his B.A. in engineering science from the University of Oxford, U.K., and his Ph.D. in control engineering from the University of Cambridge, U.K. He is an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.

In such networks, a transmitter sends one or more signaling molecules, which are diffused over the medium, to the receiver to realize the communication. In order to be able to engineer synthetic molecular communication networks, mathematical models for these networks are required. This paper proposes a new stochastic model for molecular communication networks called reaction-diffusion master equation with exogenous input (RDMEX). The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time series of signaling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and chemical reactions at the receivers are modeled as Markov processes using master equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model molecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers. For the case where the reaction kinetics at the receivers is linear, we show how RDMEX can be used to determine the mean and covariance of the receiver output signals, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean receiver output signal of the RDMEX model. These closed-form expressions reveal that the output signal of a receiver can be affected by the presence of other receivers. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the model.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2013.2237785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/6521435/06451289.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2013.2237785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Master Equation Models for Molecular Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Extended Master Equation Models for Molecular Communication Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451289/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13529415","pubMedId":"23392385","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6451289/","volume":"12","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Master Equation Models for Molecular Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"tnb-chou-2237785-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138157S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"6521435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6521435","articleId":"6451289","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6451290,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

A novel subcarrier-pair based opportunistic DF relaying protocol is proposed. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two time slots. A subcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot for the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and the relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the subcarrier in the second slot. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or second slot is used for the source's direct transmission to a user. A benchmark protocol, same as the proposed one except that the transmit beamforming is not used for the relay-aided transmission, is also considered. For each protocol, a polynomial-complexity algorithm is developed to find at least an approximately optimum resource allocation (RA), by using continuous relaxation, the dual method, and Hungarian algorithm. Instrumental to the algorithm design is an elegant definition of optimization variables, motivated by the idea of regarding the unpaired subcarriers as virtual subcarrier pairs in the direct transmission mode. The effectiveness of the RA algorithm and the impact of relay position and total power on the protocols' performance are illustrated by numerical experiments. It is shown that for each protocol, it is more likely to pair subcarriers for relay-aided transmission when the total power is low and the relay lies in the middle between the source and user region. The proposed protocol always leads to a maximum WSR equal to or greater than that for the benchmark one, and the performance gain of using the proposed one is significant especially when the relay is in close proximity to the source and the total power is low. Theoretical analysis is presented to interpret these observations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2245326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6504823/06451297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2245326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504823","startPage":"2512","endPage":"2524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Sum Rate Maximization for Downlink OFDMA With Subcarrier-Pair Based Opportunistic DF Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Sum Rate Maximization for Downlink OFDMA With Subcarrier-Pair Based Opportunistic DF Relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13474411","dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451297/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Sum Rate Maximization for Downlink OFDMA With Subcarrier-Pair Based Opportunistic DF Relaying","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2245326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.248398S","chronDate":"May15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6504823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6504823","articleId":"6451297","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451298,"authors":[{"name":"Weile Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6492148/6451298/6451298-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weile Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2012.","From October 2010 to October 2011, he was a visiting scholar at the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA.

In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to allow the OBUs to exchange data and complement the missing packets. Specifically, we introduce a coalitional graph game to model the cooperation among OBUs and propose a coalition formation algorithm to implement the P2P approach. Moreover, cognitive radio (CR) is utilized for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) transmissions so that the P2P approach does not require additional bandwidth. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better under various conditions, relative to the noncooperative approach, in which the OBUs share no information and simply respond to any data request from other OBUs.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2245353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6631523/06451300.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2245353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631523","startPage":"4010","endPage":"4019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalitional Graph Games for Popular Content Distribution in Cognitive Radio VANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coalitional Graph Games for Popular Content Distribution in Cognitive Radio VANETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843059","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451300/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coalitional Graph Games for Popular Content Distribution in Cognitive Radio VANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-han-2245353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110775S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6631523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6631523","articleId":"6451300","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6451301,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Maso","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent-SUP\u00c9ELEC, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6530672/6451301/6451301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Maso (S'12) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in telecommunications engineering in 2005 and 2008, respectively, from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He worked on projects dealing with practical implementations of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing packet synchronization in 2005/06 and DVB-T2 system simulation in 2008/09.

We target our efforts on a Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) macrocell sharing the spectrum with a randomly deployed second tier of small cells. In such networks, high levels of cochannel interference between the macrocell base station and the small-cell base station (SBS) may largely limit the potential spectral efficiency gains provided by frequency reuse 1. To address this issue, we propose a novel cognitive interference alignment-based scheme to protect the macrocell from cross-tier interference while mitigating the co-tier interference in the second tier. Remarkably, only local channel state information (CSI) and autonomous operations are required in the second tier, resulting in a completely self-organizing approach for the SBSs. The optimal precoder that maximizes the spectral efficiency of the link between each SBS and its served user equipment is found by means of a distributed one-shot strategy. Numerical findings reveal nonnegligible spectral efficiency enhancements with respect to traditional time division multiple access (TDMA) approaches at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Additionally, the proposed technique exhibits significant robustness to channel estimation errors, achieving remarkable results for the imperfect CSI case and yielding consistent performance enhancements to the network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Approach to Interference Alignment in OFDM-Based Two-Tiered Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2245516","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6530672/06451301.pdf","startPage":"1935","endPage":"1949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2245516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Approach to Interference Alignment in OFDM-Based Two-Tiered Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6451301/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","publicationDate":"Jun 2013","accessionNumber":"13563766","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Approach to Interference Alignment in OFDM-Based Two-Tiered Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-maso-2245516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092018S","chronDate":"Jun  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6530672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6530672","articleId":"6451301","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6451302,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6557008/6451302/6451302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian Chen (M'09) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in computer science and engineering from Xi'an Jiao Tong University, Xi'an, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2011.","He is a Scientist with the Institute for Infocomm Research, A\u2217STAR, Singapore.

A directional cooperative MAC protocol, namely, D-CoopMAC, is proposed to coordinate the uplink channel access among DMG stations (STAs) that operate in an IEEE 802.11ad WLAN. Using a 3-D Markov chain model with consideration of the directional hidden terminal problem, we develop a framework to analyze the performance of the D-CoopMAC protocol and derive a closed-form expression of saturated system throughput. Performance evaluations validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and show that the performance of D-CoopMAC varies with the number of DMG STAs or beam sectors. In addition, the D-CoopMAC protocol can significantly improve system performance, as compared with the traditional IEEE 802.11ad MAC protocol.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6557008/06451302.pdf","startPage":"2667","endPage":"2677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2245352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2245352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557008","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional Cooperative MAC Protocol Design and Performance Analysis for IEEE 802.11ad WLANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Media Access Protocol","Directional antennas","Performance analysis","Wireless LAN","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cooperative communication","directive antennas","Markov processes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional cooperative MAC protocol design","IEEE 802.11ad WLAN","directional multigigabit transmission problem","DMG transmission problem","wireless local area networks","random-access-based medium access control layer protocol","random-access-based MAC layer protocol","directional antenna","cooperative communication technique","uplink channel access","DMG stations","3D Markov chain model","directional hidden terminal problem","D-CoopMAC protocol","theoretical analysis","DMG STA","beam sectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communication","directional antenna","IEEE 802.11ad","medium access control (MAC)","performance analysis","saturated system throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Directional Cooperative MAC Protocol Design and Performance Analysis for IEEE 802.11ad WLANs","volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6451302/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13655100","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional Cooperative MAC Protocol Design and Performance Analysis for IEEE 802.11ad WLANs","sourcePdf":"tvt-peng-2245352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13973S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6557008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6557008","articleId":"6451302","onlineDate":"06 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6451306,"authors":[{"name":"Dar\u00edo Perez-Calderon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Escuela Superior de Ingenieros, University of Seville, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6469242/6451306/6451306-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dar\u00edo P\u00e9rez-Calder\u00f3n was born in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.

Three outer bounds are derived, under different assumptions of cooperation and providing side information to receivers. The novelty in the derivation lies in the careful selection of side information, which results in the cancellation of the negative differential entropy terms containing signal components, leading to a tractable outer bound. The overall outer bound is obtained by taking the minimum of the three outer bounds. The derived bounds are simplified for the MIMO Gaussian symmetric IC to obtain outer bounds on the generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF). The relative performance of the bounds yields insight into the performance limits of multiuser MIMO GICs and the relative merits of different schemes for interference management. These insights are confirmed by establishing the optimality of the bounds in specific cases using an inner bound on the GDOF derived by the authors in a previous work. It is also shown that many of the existing results on the GDOF of the GIC can be obtained as special cases of the bounds, e.g., by setting K=2 or the number of antennas at each user to 1.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.010913.120132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6451308/06451311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.010913.120132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451308","startPage":"176","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outer Bounds on the Sum Rate of the K-User MIMO Gaussian Interference Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6451311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outer Bounds on the Sum Rate of the K-User MIMO Gaussian Interference Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6451311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13288016","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6451311/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outer Bounds on the Sum Rate of the K-User MIMO Gaussian Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"176-tc1301-mohap.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065836S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6451308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6451308","articleId":"6451311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6451351,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxiang Zhong","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of High Voltage and EMC, School of Electric and Electronic Engineering, State key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/6451332/6451351/6451351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Xiang Zhong was born in Sichuan China, in 1988.

The method to generate such topologies is presented and discussed. The methodology is also briefly discussed to the buckboost converter. To further analyze the reliability of the method and the characteristics of the derived converters, the two Integrated Boost-Flyback converters have been evaluated.

This paper demonstrates a detailed study on time and hardware requirements of residue-to-binary converters (RC) and residue arithmetic units (RAU), based on each of the studied sets, categorized by the dynamic range (DR) they provide. Then, the most efficient moduli set for each DR is suggested. The effect of moduli number on the system's performance and complexity is also discussed. Our research is aimed for designs whose main goal and strategy is balanced.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6454266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454344","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423308/6454266/06454344.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study on different moduli sets in residue number system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study on different moduli sets in residue number system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6454344/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290449","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6454344/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study on different moduli sets in residue number system","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"151paper16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087279S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423308","isNumber":"6454266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423308","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6454266","articleId":"6454344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6454392,"authors":[{"name":"Bijay Neupane","affiliation":["Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Bijay","lastName":"Neupane","id":"38548187300"},{"name":"Kasun S.

In such a market, forecasting electricity prices is essential to helping stakeholders with the decision making process. Electricity price forecasting is an inherently difficult problem due to its special characteristics of dynamicity and nonstationarity. In our research, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model on carefully crafted input features for forecasting hourly electricity prices for the next 24 hours. The input features are selected from a pool of features derived from information such as past electricity price data, weather data, and calendar data. A wrapper method for feature selection is used in which the ANN model is continuously trained and updated in order to select the best feature set. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the published results of the state-of-the-art Pattern Sequence-based Forecasting (PSF) method on the same data sets and our method is observed to provide superior results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454392","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423308/6454266/06454392.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6454266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network-based electricity price forecasting for smart grid deployment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6454392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network-based electricity price forecasting for smart grid deployment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13290456","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6454392/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network-based electricity price forecasting for smart grid deployment","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"151paper22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07639S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423308","isNumber":"6454266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423308","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6454266","articleId":"6454392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6454440,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Mohajer","affiliation":["Cognitive Radio Research Group, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Mohajer","id":"38546717300"},{"name":"Fereshteh Atri Niasar","affiliation":["Cognitive Radio Research Group, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fereshteh Atri","lastName":"Niasar","id":"38547810500"},{"name":"Mohammad Nabipour","affiliation":["Cognitive Radio Research Group, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Nabipour","id":"38546931900"},{"name":"Ali Azami Ghadikolayi","affiliation":["Cognitive Radio Research Group, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Azami","lastName":"Ghadikolayi","id":"38546980500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5157-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5155-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5156-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6454440","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6454440","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Network coding","Throughput","Sensors","Encoding","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","network coding","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable cognitive radio systems","code-based relay","cooperative spectrum sensing","error effect","network coding","received sensing information","opportunistic relay selection","capacity gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","Opportunistic Network Coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454440","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423308/6454266/06454440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6454266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient code-based relay algorithm for reliable cognitive radio systems","abstract":"Cooperative spectrum sensing taking into account the error effect on the sensing information reporting and increase in efficiency is studied.

Firstly, MH-FTL decreases memory space of the address mapping table greatly by three levels address mapping method, including block group level address translation (BGAT), block level address translation (BAT) and page level address translation (PAT). Secondly, it makes the storage devices always working at its best performance through pipeline block group address mapping technology and parallel block group address mapping technology for BGAT and pipeline block address translation for BAT, all of those methods take the integrating way of multi-Flash within mass data storage devices into account. Thirdly, it uses non-associate page address translation with double threshold values to guarantee the small data write performance. Compared with the existing PAT, BAT and HAT FTL, MH-FTL's write amplification is almost the same as PAT and HAT, but far below to BAT, the effective write speed is the best of all. Under the performance estimate condition of this paper, MH-FTL's write speed is more than ten times fast of PAT, BAT, and HAT at most. For large data storage, the memory space occupation of address mapping table is one-sixteenth of BAT and HAT, and the small data write performance is not decreased as well.","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2012.42","publicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Intelligent System Design and Engineering Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Intelligent System Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6451324/6454257/06454675.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2012.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6454257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6454675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel NAND Flash FTL for Mass Data Storage Devices Based on Hybrid Address Translation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6454675/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel NAND Flash FTL for Mass Data Storage Devices Based on Hybrid Address Translation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6454675/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13290898","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel NAND Flash FTL for Mass Data Storage Devices Based on Hybrid Address Translation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4923a150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066626S","chronDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451324","isNumber":"6454257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451324","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6454257","articleId":"6454675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6454779,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Sang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Sang","id":"38548199800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4923-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6454779","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Software as a service","Digital forensics","Security","Computational modeling","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","digital forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["log based approach","digital forensics","cloud computing","information and communication technology","security issue","Internet environment","forensic purpose"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","digital forensic","log","security"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is getting more and more attention from the information and communication technologies industry recently. Almost all the leading companies of the information area show their interesting and efforts on cloud computing and release services about cloud computing in succession. But if want to make it go further, we should pay more effort on security issues. Especially, the Internet environment now has become more and more unsecure. With the popularization of computers and intelligent devices, the number of crime on them has increased rapidly in last decades, and will be quicker on the cloud computing environment in future. No wall is wall in the world. We should enhance the cloud computing not only at the aspect of precaution, but also at the aspect of dealing with the security events to defend it from crime activities. In this paper, I propose a approach which using logs model to building a forensic-friendly system. Using this model we can quickly gather information from cloud computing for some kinds of forensic purpose. And this will decrease the complexity of those kinds of forensics.","doi":"10.1109/ISDEA.2012.29","publicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Intelligent System Design and Engineering Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Intelligent System Design and Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6451324/6454257/06454779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2012.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6454257","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Log Based Approach to Make Digital Forensics Easier on Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6454779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Log Based Approach to Make Digital Forensics Easier on Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6454779/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13290911","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6454779/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Log Based Approach to Make Digital Forensics Easier on Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"4923a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064291S","chronDate":"16-18 Jan. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6451324","isNumber":"6454257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451324","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6454257","articleId":"6454779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6454814,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Xingwei","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xingwei","id":"38547889600"},{"name":"Lu Dawei","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Dawei","id":"37981426100"},{"name":"Yang Afeng","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Afeng","id":"38546881400"},{"name":"Zhang Jun","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jun","id":"37669969600"},{"name":"Du Chun","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Du","lastName":"Chun","id":"38546993500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4923-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6454814","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Genetic algorithms","Entropy","Wavelet coefficients","Doppler effect","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","genetic algorithms","mean square error methods","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform threshold shrinkage","genetic algorithm","sample entropy","noisy signal denoising","WTS method","wavelet function","decomposition level","threshold functions","signal complexity","fitness function","root mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transform threshold shrinkage","genetic algorithm","fitness function","sample entropy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6454814","abstract":"In order to denoise different type of noisy signals, the genetic algorithm and sample entropy are applied to the wavelet transform threshold shrinkage (WTS) method.

Generating offspring of each population is performed by randomly generating new individuals, inbreeding between individuals in the same population and crossbreeding between individuals from different populations. The next generation is produced by selecting the best ones from current populations and offspring.

Considering that compressive sensing has a good performance on protecting and extracting information in images, it is involved to improve super-resolution. Image blocking is carried out in the process of establishing over-complete dictionaries. After vectorizing all blocks of training samples with different resolutions, the low-resolution and high-resolution over-complete dictionaries turn out by means of placing vectors by pair and correspondingly. On this basis, sparse coefficients of each low-resolution image can be worked out through measurement and OMP algorithm. Depending upon these coefficients, the desired high-resolution image can be constructed. Additionally a well-chosen sparsity is always an important factor that simplifies calculations and gets rid of noises.

However, the infrastructure is not ideal for communication because of signal attenuation and noise due to its harsh and noisy transmission medium, regulations and admission, and isolated place.

The singular values of a cover image are modified by multiple scaling factors to embed the watermark image. since the values of scaling factors determine the watermark strength, therefore, we use the genetic algorithm to search the proper values in order to satisfy both imperceptibility and robustness requirements.

Some aspects, such as, the number of users per AP and reducing the distance from the users to an AP, could be objective function parameters in the network optimization problem. This article presents a novel model to AP design, where the area covered and the users connected are maximized, and the number of APs is minimized. Two different algorithms to deal with the AP design are presented, the greedy search heuristic and a genetic algorithm.

Therefore, it can also be implemented by the use of a modification of Kung's pipelines structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Algorithm of the Discrete Cosine Transform for the Fermat Prime-Length","publicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICGEC.2012.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6451318/6456837/06457261.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGEC.2012.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6456837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Algorithm of the Discrete Cosine Transform for the Fermat Prime-Length","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6457261/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290857","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Algorithm of the Discrete Cosine Transform for the Fermat Prime-Length","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"4763a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065878S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6451318","isNumber":"6456837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6451318","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6456837","articleId":"6457261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6457277,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Chuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37657426300"},{"name":"Pei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Yin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37311131600"},{"name":"Chih-Yuan Lien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yuan","lastName":"Lien","id":"37307708300"},{"name":"Hung-Yu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Yu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37596717600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2138-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4763-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6457277","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Nonlinear distortion","Interpolation","Image resolution","Lenses","Surveillance","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computational complexity","data compression","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity scaling scheme","barrel distortion correction","wide-angle cameras","surveillance","medical imaging applications","wide-angle lens","compressed image","scaling technique","radial symmetric characteristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scaling scheme","wide-angle","barrel distortion correction"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a low-complexity scaling scheme which used for barrel distortion correction.

One of the main topics of the research is to develop evolutionary many-objective optimization (EMAO) algorithms that can solve optimization problems with more than three objectives. EMAO algorithms generally differ from evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms as EMO algorithms are known to work mainly for optimization problems with two or three objectives. Thus far the performance of EMO algorithms has been validated using both benchmark test problems and real-world applications. Although the performance of EMAO algorithms has also been shown using benchmark test problems, their performance on real-world applications rarely appears in the literature. in this paper we examine the performance of state-of-the-art EMAO algorithms by applying them to a real-world application, namely a hybrid car controller optimization problem with six objectives.

First, a novel turbo blockwise operating equalizer structure is proposed by jointly optimizing the feed-forward and feedback filters at each iteration based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Optimization of the filter coefficients, utilized for feed-forward equalization and decision feedback, is performed in both time and frequency domains, and the equivalence between them is established by unifying the iterative block equalization with the feed-forward and feedback filters in various domains. The corresponding filters are obtained analytically in a closed form as a solution of the constrained Wiener-Hopf equation with the use of average reliability information. Second, asymptotic performance and diversity analysis of the proposed single carrier frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE) is carried out that leads to insights on the structures of the filters in the high SNR regime. Furthermore, we elaborate on the rate and diversity tradeoff of the space-time coded SC-FDE based on the proposed equalizer structure and the space-frequency coded OFDM systems. Performance comparison between the proposed SC-FDE scheme and OFDM is made. The proposed SC-FDE scheme performs very close to the genie-aided performance bounds and better than OFDM based transmission.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.110759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6473967/06457362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.110759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473967","startPage":"609","endPage":"619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Framework for Optimum Iterative Blockwise Equalization of Single Carrier MIMO Systems and Asymptotic Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A General Framework for Optimum Iterative Blockwise Equalization of Single Carrier MIMO Systems and Asymptotic Performance Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13355181","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457362/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Framework for Optimum Iterative Blockwise Equalization of Single Carrier MIMO Systems and Asymptotic Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"609-tc1302-guven.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08458S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6473967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6473967","articleId":"6457362","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6457363,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Quoc Ngo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6514800/6457363/6457363-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hien Quoc Ngo received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in electronics and radio engineering from Kyung Hee University, Korea, in 2010.

The array uses imperfect channel-state information derived from transmitted pilots to extract the individual data streams. The power radiated by the terminals can be made inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of base station antennas with no reduction in performance. In contrast if perfect channel-state information were available the power could be made inversely proportional to the number of antennas. Lower capacity bounds for maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection are derived. An MRC receiver normally performs worse than ZF and MMSE. However as power levels are reduced, the cross-talk introduced by the inferior maximum-ratio receiver eventually falls below the noise level and this simple receiver becomes a viable option. The tradeoff between the energy efficiency (as measured in bits/J) and spectral efficiency (as measured in bits/channel use/terminal) is quantified for a channel model that includes small-scale fading but not large-scale fading. It is shown that the use of moderately large antenna arrays can improve the spectral and energy efficiency with orders of magnitude compared to a single-antenna system.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.110848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.110848","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06457363.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy and Spectral Efficiency of Very Large Multiuser MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy and Spectral Efficiency of Very Large Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487669","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457363/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and Spectral Efficiency of Very Large Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1436-tc1304-ngo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086769S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1814","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6457363","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6457367,"authors":[{"name":"Hsien-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6507371/6457367/6457367-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsien-Wen Chang (S'09-M'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsin-chu, Taiwan, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

A power amplifier (PA) is one of the most power consuming analog devices at the transmitter in communication systems and a precise estimation of the power consumption at the transmitter circuit requires the knowledge of its efficiency that depends on the distribution of input signal envelope and the amount of input back-off. In this paper, we develop a simple analytical model that can be used for estimating achievable efficiency of a linear PA as well as the amount of resulting nonlinear distortion for a given modulated signal exclusively from its envelope distribution. Based on this model, the trade-off relationships between the efficiency and signal-to-distortion power ratio for several spectrally efficient linear modulations are examined. It is also shown that in some special cases of Gaussian input and memoryless nonlinearity PA models, the results can be represented in simple closed-form expressions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06457368.pdf","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.120384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.120384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis of Band-limited Communication Systems from Amplifier Efficiency and Distortion Perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Numerical models","Modulation","Communication systems","OFDM","Analytical models","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-limited communication system analysis","amplifier efficiency","green communications","power consumption","power amplifier","power consuming analog devices","transmitter circuit","linear PA","nonlinear distortion","envelope distribution","signal-to-distortion power ratio","spectrally efficient linear modulations","Gaussian input model","memoryless nonlinearity PA models","closed-form expressions","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Efficiency","linear modulation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","power amplifier","signal-to-distortion power ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of Band-limited Communication Systems from Amplifier Efficiency and Distortion Perspective","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6457368/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487672","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of Band-limited Communication Systems from Amplifier Efficiency and Distortion Perspective","sourcePdf":"1460-tc1304-hideki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085117S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6457368","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457369,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The cell area is divided into several sectors, each serviced by an individual relay station (RS). In order to have simultaneous transmissions by the users in neighbouring sectors, we assume that users of each individual sector use separate set of orthogonal channels to communicate with the RS and the base station (BS). Moreover, a separate orthogonal channel is shared among relays for transmission to the BS. For uplink communication, users are allowed to choose between two modes of transmission, namely, direct transmission mode and relayed transmission mode through a simple transmission mode selection algorithm. Users are allocated fractions of the time-slot for the first phase of transmission (from the users to the BS and the RSs) in a time-division multiple access (TDMA) fashion. For the second phase of transmission (from the RSs to the BS), each RS is allocated a fraction of the time-slot. We model the problem of end-to-end (e2e) delay-optimal scheduling as an infinite-horizon average reward Markov decision process (MDP) for users and relays in two separate stages. An online learning approach is then employed to solve the problem in a distributed manner for both users and relays in each phase of transmission. The proposed online stochastic learning solution converges to the optimal solution almost surely (with probability 1) under some realistic conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional scheduling schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06457370.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.120457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.120457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Optimal Distributed Scheduling in Multi-User Multi-Relay Cellular Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Delay","Mathematical model","Resource management","Wireless networks","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Markov processes","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-optimal distributed scheduling","multiuser multirelay cellular wireless networks","relay station","RS","orthogonal channels","base station","BS","uplink communication","direct transmission mode","relayed transmission mode","transmission mode selection algorithm","time-division multiple access","TDMA","time-slot","infinite-horizon average reward Markov decision process","MDP","online stochastic learning solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-user multi-relay networks","delay-optimal resource allocation and scheduling","Markov decision process (MDP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Optimal Distributed Scheduling in Multi-User Multi-Relay Cellular Wireless Networks","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6457370/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487674","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Optimal Distributed Scheduling in Multi-User Multi-Relay Cellular Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"1349-tc1304-moghad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172616S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6457370","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6457385,"authors":[{"name":"Mukesh Singhal","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering program, University of California, Merced, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mukesh Singhal is a Chancellor's Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of California, Merced.

State-of-the-art ASR systems achieve a high recognition accuracy for well-formed utterances of a variety of languages by decoding speech into the most likely sequence of words among all possible sentences represented by a finite-state network (FSN) approximation of all the knowledge sources required by the ASR task. However, the ASR problem is still far from being solved because not all information available in the speech knowledge hierarchy can be directly integrated into the FSN to improve the ASR performance and enhance system robustness. It is believed that some of the current issues of integrating various knowledge sources in top-down integrated search can be partially addressed by processing techniques that take advantage of the full set of acoustic and language information in speech. It has long been postulated that human speech recognition (HSR) determines the linguistic identity of a sound based on detected evidence that exists at various levels of the speech knowledge hierarchy, ranging from acoustic phonetics to syntax and semantics. This calls for a bottom-up attribute detection and knowledge integration framework that links speech processing with information extraction, by spotting speech cues with a bank of attribute detectors, weighting and combining acoustic evidence to form cognitive hypotheses, and verifying these theories until a consistent recognition decision can be reached. The recently proposed automatic speech attribute transcription (ASAT) framework is an attempt to mimic some HSR capabilities with asynchronous speech event detection followed by bottom-up knowledge integration and verification. In the last few years, ASAT has demonstrated good potential and has been applied to a variety of existing applications in speech processing and information extraction.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2013.2238591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504474","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1115","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6504474/06457407.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Information-Extraction Approach to Speech Processing: Analysis, Detection, Verification, and Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457407/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Information-Extraction Approach to Speech Processing: Analysis, Detection, Verification, and Recognition","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13730206","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"101","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information-Extraction Approach to Speech Processing: Analysis, Detection, Verification, and Recognition","sourcePdf":"jproc-siniscalchi-2238591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223106S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6504474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6504474","articleId":"6457407","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6457411,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaojing Wu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Informational Science, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6564408/6457411/6457411-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhaojing Wu (M'09) was born in Qufu, Shandong, China in 1970.

To analyze properties of the switched system by means of It\u00f4's formula and Dynkin's formula, it is critical to show switching instants being stopping times. When the given active-region set can be replaced by its interior, the local solution of the switched system is constructed by defining a series of stopping times as switching instants, and the criteria on global existence and stability of solution are presented by Lyapunov approach. For the case where the active-region set can not be replaced by its interior, the switched systems do not necessarily have solutions, thereby quasi-solution to the underlying problem is constructed and the boundedness criterion is proposed. The significance of this paper is that all the results presented depend on some easily-verified assumptions that are as elegant as those in the deterministic case, and the proofs themselves provide design procedures for switching controls.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems With State-Dependent Switching","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2013.2246094","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6564408/06457411.pdf","startPage":"1904","endPage":"1918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2013.2246094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6564408","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Stability of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems With State-Dependent Switching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6457411/","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13678428","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems With State-Dependent Switching","sourcePdf":"tac-wu-2246094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122589S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6564408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6564408","articleId":"6457411","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6457424,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas M.

In this paper, we study the Kalman filter in the context of echo cancellation. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we derive a different form of the Kalman filter by considering, at each iteration, a block of time samples instead of one time sample as it is the case in the conventional approach. Second, we show how this general Kalman filter (GKF) is connected with some of the most popular adaptive filters for echo cancellation, i.e., the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm, the affine projection algorithm (APA) and its proportionate version (PAPA). Third, a simplified Kalman filter is developed in order to reduce the computational load of the GKF; this algorithm behaves like a variable step-size adaptive filter. Simulation results indicate the good performance of the proposed algorithms, which can be attractive choices for echo cancellation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6457439/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13474352","volume":"21","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Study of the General Kalman Filter for Echo Cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the General Kalman Filter for Echo Cancellation","sourcePdf":"tasl-paleologu-2245654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083429S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6508879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6508879","articleId":"6457439","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457441,"authors":[{"name":"Chengbo Li","affiliation":["Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6469242/6457441/6457441-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengbo Li received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in computational and applied mathematics from Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, in 2011.","He is currently a Research Geophysicist with the Technology-Seismic Technology Organization, ConocoPhillips, Houston.

In this paper, the dynamic performance of PMUs is evaluated, and their dynamic behaviors are analyzed. PMUs from the four largest Chinese manufacturers are tested through the established PMU test system, and their dynamic performance is comprehensively evaluated. The dynamic behaviors of the PMUs are also analyzed. Analysis shows that the spectral leakage and the averaging effect of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) under dynamic conditions are the key reasons that lead to their dynamic behaviors. The theoretical results are consistent with the experimental data and the simulation. Finally, to eliminate the spectral leakage, the DFT with a digital low-pass filter is adopted to obtain more precise phasor measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2013.2242611","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6514981/06457446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2013.2242611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514981","startPage":"1479","endPage":"1485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Evaluation of Phasor Measurement Units and Their Dynamic Behavior Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Evaluation of Phasor Measurement Units and Their Dynamic Behavior Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13487621","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457446/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Evaluation of Phasor Measurement Units and Their Dynamic Behavior Analysis","sourcePdf":"tim-bi-2242611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06686S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6514981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6514981","articleId":"6457446","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457456,"authors":[{"name":"Moein Mehrtash","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Moein","lastName":"Mehrtash","id":"37860520900"},{"name":"Mir Behrad Khamesee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mir Behrad","lastName":"Khamesee","id":"37294073300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6457456","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetomechanical effects","Damping","Magnetic levitation","Force","Magnetic moments","Magnetic separation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","diffusion","eddy currents","magnetic levitation","microfabrication","microrobots","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy-current damping effect","horizontal motions","high-precision magnetic navigation platform","nanodomain technologies","microdomain technologies","ultrahigh resolution magnetic navigation platforms","Maglev microrobotics lab","magnetic drive unit","magnetic field","noncontact propelling","damping factor","microrobot horizontal motions","conductive plate","levitated microrobot","dynamical vibrations","eddy-current distribution modeling","diffusion equation","vector magnetic potential","analytical expression","horizontal damping force","levitation performance","magnetic actuation systems","micromanipulation","microfabrication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy-current damping","magnetic levitation","magnetic navigation"]}],"abstract":"Recent advancements in micro/nano-domain technologies have led to a renewed interest in ultra-high resolution magnetic navigation platforms. A magnetic navigation platform (MNP) has been developed at the MagLev Microrobotics Lab of the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada. This platform consists of two separate basic components: a magnetic drive unit and a microrobot. The magnetic drive unit produces and regulates the magnetic field for noncontact propelling of the microrobot in an enclosed environment. The MNP is equipped with an eddy-current damper to enhance its inherent damping factor in the microrobot's horizontal motions. This paper deals with the modeling and analysis of an eddy-current damper that is formed by a conductive plate placed below the levitated microrobot to overcome inherent dynamical vibrations and improve motion precision. The modeling of eddy-current distribution in the conductive plate is investigated by solving the diffusion equation for vector magnetic potential. An analytical expression for the horizontal damping force is presented and experimentally validated. It is demonstrated that eddy-current damping is a key technique to increase the damping coefficient in a noncontact way and improve levitation performance. This damping can be widely used in applications of magnetic actuation systems in micromanipulation and microfabrication.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2245675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6566069/06457456.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6566069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2245675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"4801","endPage":"4810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Eddy-Current Damping Effect in Horizontal Motions for a High-Precision Magnetic Navigation Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Eddy-Current Damping Effect in Horizontal Motions for a High-Precision Magnetic Navigation Platform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457456/","volume":"49","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6457456/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686252","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Eddy-Current Damping Effect in Horizontal Motions for a High-Precision Magnetic Navigation Platform","sourcePdf":"tmag-khamesee-2245675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11197S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6566069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6566069","articleId":"6457456","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6457458,"authors":[{"name":"Erya Deng","affiliation":["IEF, CNRS, UMR 8622, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Erya","lastName":"Deng","id":"37072694400"},{"name":"Yue Zhang","affiliation":["IEF, CNRS, UMR 8622, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240834200"},{"name":"Jacques-Olivier Klein","affiliation":["IEF, CNRS, UMR 8622, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Jacques-Olivier","lastName":"Klein","id":"37276514100"},{"name":"Dafin\u00e9 Ravelsona","affiliation":["IEF, CNRS, UMR 8622, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Dafin\u00e9","lastName":"Ravelsona","id":"38469611800"},{"name":"Claude Chappert","affiliation":["IEF, CNRS, UMR 8622, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Chappert","id":"37315626200"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["IEF, CNRS, UMR 8622, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37536930400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6457458","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2004},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457458","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Sensors","Delay","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Nonvolatile memory","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS logic circuits","low-power electronics","MRAM devices","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power magnetic full-adder","CMOS logic circuits","logic-in-memory architecture","nonvolatile memories","NVM","STT-MRAM compact model","spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory","3D back-end integration","MFA design","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","PMA","power efficiency","die area","FA","transient simulations","industrial CMOS design kit","physical models","size 40 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary cells","full-adder","low-power design","resistive switching memories"]}],"abstract":"Power issues have become a major problem of CMOS logic circuits as technology node shrinks below 90 nm.

This is known as the maximum torque per ampere. In the field-weakening region, current minimizing solutions are found at the intersection with the voltage limits. However, the optimal problem yields fourth-order polynomials (quartic equations), and no attempt has been made to solve these quartic equations online for torque control. Instead, premade lookup tables are widely used. These lookup tables tend to be huge because it is necessary to create separate tables on the basis of the dc-link voltage and motor temperature. In this study, we utilize Ferrari's method, which gives the solution to a quartic equation, for the torque control. Further, a recursive method is also considered to incorporate the inductance change from the core saturation. A simulation and some experiments were performed using an electric vehicle motor, which demonstrated the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2245920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6525347/06457462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2245920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525347","startPage":"5603","endPage":"5617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Minimizing Torque Control of the IPMSM Using Ferrari\u2019s Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Current Minimizing Torque Control of the IPMSM Using Ferrari\u2019s Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13539099","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457462/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Minimizing Torque Control of the IPMSM Using Ferrari\u2019s Method","sourcePdf":"tpel-nam-2245920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066812S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6525347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6525347","articleId":"6457462","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457477,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6482682/6457477/6457477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Chen received the B.Eng. degree and M.Eng. degree in communications engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Cambridge, U.K., in 2012.","He is currently an Associate Professor with Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China.

By capitalizing on the MSE of the oracle estimator, whose performance has been shown to act as a benchmark to the performance of standard sparse recovery algorithms, we use the fact that a Parseval tight frame is the closest design - in the Frobenius norm sense - to the solution of a convex relaxation of the optimization problem that relates to the minimization of the MSE of the oracleestimator with respect to the equivalent sensing matrix, subject to sensing energy constraints. Based on this result, we then propose two sensing matrix designs that exhibit two key properties: the designs are closed form rather than iterative; the designs exhibit superior performance in relation to other designs in the literature, which is revealed by our numerical investigation in various scenarios with different sparse recovery algorithms including basis pursuit de-noise (BPDN), the Dantzig selector and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6482682/06457477.pdf","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2245661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2245661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection Design for Statistical Compressive Sensing: A Tight Frame Based Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Compressed sensing","Dictionaries","Image reconstruction","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","convex programming","estimation theory","iterative methods","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","minimisation","relaxation theory","signal denoising","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical compressive sensing","projection design","mean squared error performance","sensing energy cost constraint","oracle estimator","standard sparse recovery algorithms","Parseval tight frame based approach","Frobenius norm sensor","convex relaxation","optimization problem","MSE minimization","equivalent sensing matrix design","numerical investigation","basis pursuit denoising","BPDN","Dantzig selector","orthogonal matching pursuit","OMP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","overcomplete dictionary","sensing projection design","sparse representation","tight frames"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Projection Design for Statistical Compressive Sensing: A Tight Frame Based Approach","volume":"61","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6457477/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13396868","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection Design for Statistical Compressive Sensing: A Tight Frame Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-2245661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15281S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6482682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6482682","articleId":"6457477","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6457478,"authors":[{"name":"Weijia Han","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory and State Key Laboratory (ISN), Information Science Institute, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6482682/6457478/6457478-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weijia Han (S'07\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree from Northwest University, China, the M.S. degree from Queen's University Belfast, U.K., and the Ph.D. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an, China.","He is currently a lecturer in Xidian University, Xi'an.

We formulate the calculation of sensing performance including the probabilities of detection and false alarm when regarding both i) the quantization impact and ii) the inhomogeneous background, and then conclude a condition under which the sensing performance can be calculated by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Based on this condition, two novel quantization schemes with two optimization methods are proposed to guarantee both the quantizer and decision threshold of SDF rule can be obtained efficiently, at the same time, the SDF can achieve high sensing performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2245659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482682","startPage":"1931","endPage":"1943","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6482682/06457478.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Soft Decision Fusion Rule in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457478/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Soft Decision Fusion Rule in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13396869","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Soft Decision Fusion Rule in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tsp-han-2245659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108778S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6482682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6482682","articleId":"6457478","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6457481,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Tichavsky","affiliation":["Institute of Information Theory and Automation AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6482682/6457481/6457481-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Petr Tichavsk\u00fd (M'98\u2013SM'04) received the M.S. degree in mathematics in 1987 from the Czech Technical University, Prague, and the Ph.D. degree in theoretical cybernetics from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1992.","Since that time, he has been with the Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.

However, many channels cause erasures in addition to errors. In principle, decoding over such channels can be accomplished by deleting the erased symbols and decoding the resulting vector with respect to a punctured code. For any given linear code and any given maximum number of correctable erasures, parity-check matrices are introduced that yield parity-check equations which do not check any of the erased symbols and which are sufficient to characterize all punctured codes corresponding to this maximum number of erasures. These matrices allow for the separation of erasures from errors to facilitate decoding. Several constructions of such separating parity-check matrices are presented. To reduce decoding complexity, separating parity-check matrices with small number of rows are preferred. The minimum number of rows in a parity-check matrix separating a given maximum number of erasures is called the separating redundancy. Upper and lower bounds on the separating redundancies are derived. In particular, it is shown that the separating redundancies tend to grow linearly with the number of rows in full-rank parity-check matrices of codes. The separating redundancies of some classes of codes are determined for some maximum numbers of erasures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Vectors","Linear code","Equations","Redundancy","Hamming distance","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","linear codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity-check matrices","decoding algorithms","linear codes","vector","punctured code","decoding complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error and erasure decoding","linear block code","parity-check matrix","separating matrix","separating redundancy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457505","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2245939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6516641/06457505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2245939","startPage":"3332","endPage":"3346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parity-Check Matrices Separating Erasures From Errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parity-Check Matrices Separating Erasures From Errors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13499508","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parity-Check Matrices Separating Erasures From Errors","sourcePdf":"tit-abdelghaffar-2245939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041412S","chronDate":"June  2013","isNumber":"6516641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6457505","onlineDate":"07 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457514,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183925300"},{"name":"Seung Joon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Joon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37367720800"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6457514","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Fading","Approximation methods","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Approximation algorithms","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","computational complexity","Rayleigh channels","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity rate selection","chase combining","Rayleigh block-fading channels","hybrid automatic repeat request","HARQ-CC","long-term channel statistics","instantaneous channel information","long-term rate adaptation","transmission rate optimal selection","two-step numerical search procedure","suboptimal rate-selection algorithm","second-step numerical search","closed-form Lambert W function","first-step numerical search","closed-form lower bound","long-term average transmission rate","optimal numerical search algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)","rate selection","Rayleigh block fading"]}],"abstract":"We consider hybrid automatic repeat request with Chase combining (HARQ-CC) in a Rayleigh block-fading channel, where rate adaptation is based on long-term channel statistics instead of instantaneous channel information because the latter may be outdated.

Although user cooperation improves the overall efficiency of the network, it requires incentive to stimulate potential relay nodes to assist the source by forwarding its data to the destination. Moreover, the potential relays are better informed than the source about their channel conditions to destination, which results in asymmetric information between the source and the relays. In this paper, we study the problem of lack of forwarding incentive in cooperative communication when channel state information of relays is private information and not known by the source. To tackle this problem, we apply the principle of contract theory to a cooperative wireless system. Source first designs incentive compatible and individually rational contract, consisting of a set of power-credit pairs. Then it broadcasts contract items to nearby nodes. Once the source node receives reply messages from the volunteer relays, it chooses one or more relays based on its requirements and communication starts. Simulation results show how credit assignment works in order to stimulate relays to cooperate and prevents relays from cheating behavior.","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6245522/6457518/06457528.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"43","doi":"10.1109/CC.2013.6457528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2013.6457528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative communication with asymmetric channel state information: A contract theoretic modeling approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative communication with asymmetric channel state information: A contract theoretic modeling approach","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13427481","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative communication with asymmetric channel state information: A contract theoretic modeling approach","sourcePdf":"3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06745S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6457518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6457528","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6457529,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Jiming","affiliation":["Ranplan Wireless Network and Design Limited, UK"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Jiming","id":"37391611000"},{"name":"Wang Peng","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Peng","id":"38547476000"},{"name":"Zhang Jie","affiliation":["The Communications Group, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jie","id":"38547426500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"6457529","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":986},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Buildings","Telecommunication network management","Wireless communication","RF signals","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interference suppression","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","radiowave propagation","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum efficiency","mutual interference mitigation","dominant interference strength","indoor femtocell deployment","indoor wireless RF signal propagation prediction","Ranplan smallcell","optimization tool suite","indoor network planning phase","interfemtocell interference","outdoor macrocell","offload indoor traffic","hotspot deployment","residential building","office building","3D in-building dense femtocell network","adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["in-building femtocell networks","soft frequency reuse","adaptive interference coordination"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell networks have emerged as a key technology in residential, office building or hotspot deployments that can significantly fulfill high data demands in order to offload indoor traffic from outdoor macro cells. However, as one of the major challenges, inter-femtocell interference gets worse in 3D in-building scenarios because of the presence of numerous interfering sources and then needs to be considered in the early network planning phase.

In this paper, a new adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme in the dense femtocell networks is proposed, where multiple dense femtocells are classified into a number of groups according to the dominant interference strength to others, then the minimum subchannels with different frequency reuse factors for these groups are determined and transmit powers of the grouping sub-channels are adaptively adjusted based on the strength to mitigate the mutual interference. Simulation results show the proposed scheme yields great performance gains in terms of the spectrum efficiency relative to the legacy soft frequency reuse and universal frequency reuse.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2013.6457529","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6245522/6457518/06457529.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2013.6457529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457518","startPage":"44","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme for in-building dense femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme for in-building dense femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457529/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13427482","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme for in-building dense femtocell networks","sourcePdf":"4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036453S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6457518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6457529","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457597,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Reza Mirzaei","affiliation":["K.

This method is based on comparing the differences in the arrival times, to antennas in the transformer, of EM waves emitted from the PD source. From the measured UHF signal, and factoring in the influence of the transformer active part on the EM wave propagation, the correct determination of an EM wave arrival time in the localization algorithm is a critical task that influences the accuracy of the UHF PD localization method. Nearly all weak points in the dielectric system of power transformers generate PD. These discharges gradually degrade the insulation, leading to transformer failure. It is possible to detect these defects in the early stages of PD generation by measuring and analyzing the PD data. Suitable maintenance and repair strategies can then be implemented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/57/6457590/06457597.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MEI.2013.6457597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEI.2013.6457597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method for ultra-high-frequency partial discharge localization in power transformers using the particle swarm optimization algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Partial discharges","Power transformer insulation","Transformers","Oil insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","partial discharge measurement","particle swarm optimisation","power transformers","UHF measurement","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-high-frequency partial discharge localization method","power transformers","particle swarm optimization algorithm","ultra-high-frequency electromagnetic waves","UHF-EM waves","PD source","measured UHF signal","EM wave propagation","UHF PD localization method","dielectric system","transformer failure","maintenance-repair strategy","PD data measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transformer","partial discharge","ultra-high frequency","localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel method for ultra-high-frequency partial discharge localization in power transformers using the particle swarm optimization algorithm","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6457597/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2013","accessionNumber":"13287409","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method for ultra-high-frequency partial discharge localization in power transformers using the particle swarm optimization algorithm","sourcePdf":"EIM2-026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060495S","chronDate":"March-April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"57","isNumber":"6457590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"57","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6457590","articleId":"6457597","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457622,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The method involves with sampling process of the random numbers and probability to estimate the result. As MC method depending on a large number of good quality random numbers to produce a high accuracy result, developing a good random number generator (RNG) is vital. Most of random number generators are developed in software based, with the improvement of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) density and speed in recent days, implementing random number generator (RNG) directly into hardware is feasible. Random Walk on the Boundary (WOB) is one of MC methods that applied to calculate the unit cube capacitance. The unique requirement of this method is the random numbers produced by RNG must fall within the Gaussian distribution and the maximum decimal values in the range of [0, 1]. Thus, in this paper we presented a novel hardware RNG for Random WOB method to calculate unit cube capacitance in FPGA. The RNG is implemented in floating-point base, using the combination of Cellular Automata Shift Register (CASR) and Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) then channeled through Box-Muller transformation. There is linear approximation in computing logarithmic function applied in Box-Muller transformation. Based on statistical tests, the random numbers generated is nearly 97.5% resembling the standard normal distribution.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6420060/6457612/06457622.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2012.6457622","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2012.6457622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based RNG for random WOB method in unit cube capacitance calculation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based RNG for random WOB method in unit cube capacitance calculation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457622/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6457622/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291712","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based RNG for random WOB method in unit cube capacitance calculation","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p011niun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076336S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6420060","isNumber":"6457612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6420060","xplore-issue":"6457612","articleId":"6457622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457627,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Instead of transmitting the second frames on orthogonal sub-channels from the source and relay nodes to the destination, we used Alamouti scheme in the second frame. In particular, we assume that the channel state information is estimated at all nodes involved in the transmission process. Assuming decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, we derived upper bounds on the bit error rate (BER) for M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) transmission with channel estimation errors. Our analytical results have shown that a performance close to perfect channel knowledge can be obtained when the number of pilot symbols increases. At low pilot to noise ratio (PNR), the proposed scheme cannot provide significant performance improvements. Finally, the performance of the system degrades significantly. This diversity degradation is attributed to the channel estimation errors made at the relay and destination nodes.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6420060/6457612/06457653.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"169","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2012.6457653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2012.6457653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded cooperative networks with channel estimation technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Coded cooperative networks with channel estimation technique","htmlLink":"/document/6457653/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13308105","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded cooperative networks with channel estimation technique","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p164elfituri.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060141S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6420060","isNumber":"6457612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6420060","xplore-issue":"6457612","articleId":"6457653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6457655,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is known that the location estimation accuracy suffers from poor geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) caused by BS location as the conventional location algorithms which result in large GDOP values correspond to poor geometrical topology. In addition, NLOS effects cause a large error in time of arrival (TOA) reading; thus affecting mobile station (MS) estimation accuracy. In this paper a novel concept of virtual BS (VirBS) utilizing multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology has been introduced and applied for improving L&P accuracy. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated via computer simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm allows up to 30 percent improvement in L&P accuracy without additional expenditure on network architecture.","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2012.6457655","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6420060/6457612/06457655.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2012.6457655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of virtual MIMO base stations for mobile location in IMT-Advanced networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457655/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of virtual MIMO base stations for mobile location in IMT-Advanced networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291736","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6457655/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of virtual MIMO base stations for mobile location in IMT-Advanced networks","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p176awangmdisa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064429S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6420060","isNumber":"6457612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6420060","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6457612","articleId":"6457655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6457656,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Azri Mohd Izhar","affiliation":["UTM-MIMOS Center of Excellence, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Azri Mohd","lastName":"Izhar","id":"38489896000"},{"name":"Norsheila Fisal","affiliation":["UTM-MIMOS Center of Excellence, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norsheila","lastName":"Fisal","id":"37297717800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3116-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3114-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3115-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6457656","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457656","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Iterative decoding","Block codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","block codes","channel coding","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","Hamming codes","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","orthogonal codes","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed turbo block code","wireless relay network","DTBC","extended Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem code","eBCH code","constituent code","orthogonal channel","parity bit sequence","decode and forward protocol","decoded systematic data","interleaved code","information bits","turbo iterative decoding","soft-input soft-output Chase-Phyndiah algorithm","CP algorithm","iteration number","line network model","cooperative scheme","minimum Hamming distance"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes distributed turbo block codes (DTBC) for wireless relay networks by using extended Bose, Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem (eBCH) codes as the constituent codes. The proposed technique assumes all channels are orthogonal and requires two phases to complete the transmission. In the first phase, the source broadcasts its information together with the parity bit sequence from the first code. The relay received the data from the source and process the data by using decode and forward protocol. The decoded systematic data at relay is interleaved and encoded by the second encoder. For the second phase, the parity sequence generated by the second encoder at relay is forwarded to the destination. In order to retrieve the original information bits, the signals received at destination from the source and relay are processed by using turbo iterative decoding technique, and for that purpose, soft-input soft-output Chase-Phyndiah (CP) algorithm is used for the decoding. We have conducted a series of simulations to study the effect of different iteration numbers at destination, different numbers of test pattern for Chase algorithm at destination and different locations of relay in a line network model. From our results, we showed that the proposed cooperative scheme outperforms the non-cooperative system as long as the relay is not too far away from the source. Finally, we presented the results of the proposed system by using different constituent codes with different minimum Hamming distances.","doi":"10.1109/APACE.2012.6457656","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics (APACE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6420060/6457612/06457656.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APACE.2012.6457656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed turbo block codes in wireless relay networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed turbo block codes in wireless relay networks","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6457656/","accessionNumber":"13291737","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed turbo block codes in wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p182mohdizhar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037088S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6420060","isNumber":"6457612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6420060","xplore-issue":"6457612","articleId":"6457656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6457748,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Mavudila Kongo","affiliation":["Phys.

The problem of between-class imbalance is a challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry, because of its critical influence on the performance of learning systems. Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters.

The method provides an efficient procedure for record linkage (3500 records per second, F-measure 0.96 on a sample of Dutch historical civil records).

The designing of standard PSO is defined in this project which has been taken into account by the latest research and developments, and is used as a guideline for performance testing by different functions.

The coding scheme is designed in such a way that the parallel interface preserves many of the attractive properties of a differential link such as low supply noise generation and immunity to common-mode noise. In addition, the coding completely eliminates the first post-cursor intersymbol interference of the channel over the entire unit-interval at no loss in throughput. As a result, Coded Differential signaling leads to substantial increase in timing margin compared to a differential link with 1-tap post-cursor equalizer, consequently without the associated complexity. The design of the channel, however, requires an innovative approach to optimize the performance and cost of the system. The theory of Coded Differential signaling, the minimization of the timing skew in the channel, and the details of the implementation of a prototype system developed based on proposed scheme for graphics memory interfaces are described in this paper. On-scope measured eye diagrams indicate 30% improvement in timing margin compared to a 1-tap predictive decision feedback equalizer system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457831/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13308336","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6457831/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of a high-speed channel for Coded Differential signaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of a high-speed channel for Coded Differential signaling","confLoc":"Tempe, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"002MI282BeyeneEPEP2012Finallatest.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055242S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424014","isNumber":"6457827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424014","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6457827","articleId":"6457831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6457841,"authors":[{"name":"Fangyi Rao","affiliation":["Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fangyi","lastName":"Rao","id":"37570166200"},{"name":"Sammy Hindi","affiliation":["Juniper Networks, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sammy","lastName":"Hindi","id":"38548755600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2538-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2539-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2537-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4107"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4115"}],"articleNumber":"6457841","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":626},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457841","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Clocks","Transfer functions","Insertion loss","Scattering parameters","Frequency modulation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","clocks","jitter","S-parameters","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain analysis","jitter amplification","clock channels","transfer function","S-parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["jitter","amplification","loss"]}],"abstract":"Clock channel jitter amplification factor in terms of transfer function or S-parameters is derived.

Results from microstrip and TSV structures have been presented which show good calculation accuracy and efficiency of the SIBC incorporated Laguerre-FDTD method.","doi":"10.1109/EPEPS.2012.6457885","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 21st Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 21st Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424014/6457827/06457885.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPS.2012.6457885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skin effect modeling of interconnects using the Laguerre-FDTD scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457885/","displayDocTitle":"Skin effect modeling of interconnects using the Laguerre-FDTD scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308386","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6457885/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skin effect modeling of interconnects using the Laguerre-FDTD scheme","confLoc":"Tempe, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"054MV936YiMingEPEPS2012Submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03679S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424014","isNumber":"6457827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424014","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6457827","articleId":"6457885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6457895,"authors":[{"name":"Yaping Zhou","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38548008300"},{"name":"Huabo Chen","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huabo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37066828900"},{"name":"Xing Wang","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Wang","id":"38548526200"},{"name":"Wenjie Mao","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Mao","id":"38547607200"},{"name":"Wenjun Shi","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Shi","id":"38547665600"},{"name":"Yu Chang","affiliation":["Nvidia Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Chang","id":"38546925700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2538-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2539-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2537-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4107"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4115"}],"articleNumber":"6457895","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Capacitance","Silicon","Integrated circuit modeling","Substrates","Analytical models","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","equivalent circuits","MIS structures","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through-silicon-vias","large signal nonlinear capacitance","TSV metal-insulator-semiconductor interface","voltage difference","virtual ground","equivalent circuit model","h-speed differential signals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457895","doi":"10.1109/EPEPS.2012.6457895","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 21st Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","abstract":"Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) have been mostly modeled assuming that the TSV metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) interface is not biased and silicon substrate is just a lossy, low conductive medium. These modeling methods are based on small signal analysis and don't consider semiconductor carrier accumulation or depletion due to static biasing or large signals. This paper argues that the complementary nature of differential signals introduces a virtual ground and that the voltage difference between a TSV and the virtual ground automatically biases TSV MIS interface, causing carrier accumulation or depletion. In the meantime, large digital signal swing makes the depletion region to change its width dynamically, which introduces a non-linear, large signal TSV capacitance. This capacitance is modeled analytically in this paper, a new equivalent circuit model for differential TSVs are proposed, and the impact on the performance of high-speed differential signals is examined in channel simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPS.2012.6457895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457827","startPage":"276","endPage":"279","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 21st Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424014/6457827/06457895.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling differential Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) with large signal, non-linear capacitance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6457895/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling differential Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) with large signal, non-linear capacitance","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308395","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling differential Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) with large signal, non-linear capacitance","confLoc":"Tempe, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"064MV1958ZhouYaping.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042782S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424014","isNumber":"6457827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424014","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6457827","articleId":"6457895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6457905,"authors":[{"name":"Juan S.

The methods are evaluated in coherent 112Gbit/s DP-64QAM system over 800km standard single mode fiber (SMF). The signals are transmitted over SMF with physical parameters of D=16 ps/nm-km, \u03b3=1.3 (km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n.W\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup>\n1) and \u03b1=0.2 dB/km. No in-line optical dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) is used to compensate the chromatic dispersion. The digital signal processing module is implemented by: (a) electronic dispersion compensation (EDC), through finite impulse response (FIR) filters and (b) split-step Fourier method based intra-channel non-linear equalizer, i.e. digital backward propagation (DBP). Furthermore, we numerically compare optical backward propagation (OBP) with optical phase conjugation (OPC) techniques, i.e. mid-link spectral inversion (MLSI), pre-dispersed spectral inversion (PD-SI) and optical phase conjugation with non-linearity module (OPC-NM). We also evaluate a self-phase modulation-based optical limiter with an appropriate pre-chirping to compensate for the intensity fluctuations, as a hybrid approach with OBP. The results depict improvement in system performance by a factor of \u2248 4dB of signal input power by all-optical signal processing methods, consequently improving the non-linear threshold point (NLT) and maximum transmission distance, which is comparative with ideal digital backward propagation (DBP) where the high complexity is the intrinsic impediment in the real-time implementation of the technique with coherent receivers. These numerical investigations will be helpful in deployment of scalable equalization of non-linearities in future optical networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Photonics Global Conference (PGC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423307/6457864/06457921.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 Photonics Global Conference (PGC)","doi":"10.1109/PGC.2012.6457921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGC.2012.6457921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6457921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and application of scalable non-linear equalization in 112Gbit/s DP-64QAM coherent transmission over single mode fibers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical distortion","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical fiber networks","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","FIR filters","Fourier analysis","light propagation","nonlinear distortion","optical distortion","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre networks","optical limiters","optical modulation","self-phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable nonlinear equalization analysis","DP-64QAM coherent transmission","single mode fibers","digital signal processing techniques","all-optical signal processing techniques","fiber transmission impairment compensation","chromatic dispersion compensation","nonlinear distortion","NL distortion","CD","Kerr effect","SMF","in-line optical dispersion compensating fiber","DCF","electronic dispersion compensation","EDC","finite impulse response filters","FIR filters","split-step Fourier method","intrachannel nonlinear equalizer","digital backward propagation","DBP","optical backward propagation","OBP","OPC techniques","mid-link spectral inversion","MLSI","predispersed spectral inversion","PD-SI","optical phase conjugation with nonlinearity module technique","self-phase modulation-based optical limiter","nonlinear threshold point","maximum transmission distance","NLT","coherent receivers","optical networks","bit rate 112 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6457921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and application of scalable non-linear equalization in 112Gbit/s DP-64QAM coherent transmission over single mode fibers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6457921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308171","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and application of scalable non-linear equalization in 112Gbit/s DP-64QAM coherent transmission over single mode fibers","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"c12a345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053721S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423307","isNumber":"6457864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423307","xplore-issue":"6457864","articleId":"6457921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6457968,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Yu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Yu","lastName":"Chang","id":"38238460800"},{"name":"Guu-Chang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guu-Chang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276271000"},{"name":"Je-Wei Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Je-Wei Su","id":"38548127800"},{"name":"Cheng-Yuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37276902100"},{"name":"Wing C.

The mode-locking generates the ultrashort optical pulses with duration of about 420 fs and repetition rate of 9.188 MHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of femtosecond pulses using actively mode-locked fiber ring laser","publicationTitle":"2012 Photonics Global Conference (PGC)","doi":"10.1109/PGC.2012.6458026","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Photonics Global Conference (PGC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423307/6457864/06458026.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGC.2012.6458026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Generation of femtosecond pulses using actively mode-locked fiber ring laser","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458026/","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308242","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of femtosecond pulses using actively mode-locked fiber ring laser","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"c12a521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046816S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423307","isNumber":"6457864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423307","xplore-issue":"6457864","articleId":"6458026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6458035,"authors":[{"name":"Tawfig Eltaif","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering & technology, Jalan Ayer Keroh Lama, Bukit Beruang, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tawfig","lastName":"Eltaif","id":"37697740200"},{"name":"Hesham A.

Modified prime code, which represents a user address and signs each transmitted data bit has been chosen as a signature sequence code because of its good periodic auto/cross correlation properties. However, simulation and theoretically analysis of balanced detection scheme based on passive networking access taking into account the effects of various noises such as shot noise, phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN), thermal noises were presented as well. Results of 25 subscribers sent in C band for the upstream signal with channel spacing 25GHz show good system performance in terms of the bit error rate and suppressing the multiple access interference when variation of fiber length and data rate are applied.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Photonics Global Conference (PGC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423307/6457864/06458035.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 Photonics Global Conference (PGC)","doi":"10.1109/PGC.2012.6458035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGC.2012.6458035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of optical CDMA based on passive optical networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive optics","Optical fiber networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","passive optical networks","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical CDMA","passive optical networks","PON","fiber access systems","optical coding","signature sequence code","balanced detection scheme","shot noise","phase-induced intensity noise","thermal noises","bit error rate","multiple access interference suppression","frequency 25 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["passive optical network (PON)","optical code devision multiple access (OCDMA)","modified prime codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of optical CDMA based on passive optical networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458035/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308249","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of optical CDMA based on passive optical networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"c12a534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070843S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423307","isNumber":"6457864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423307","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6457864","articleId":"6458035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6458041,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Abedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Abedi","id":"38357871500"},{"name":"Ehsan Mohadesrad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Mohadesrad","id":"38469328300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2516-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2513-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2515-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6458041","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"abstract":"In this paper, the tapered waveguide structure for quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers (QD-SOA's) is introduced and formulated for the first time.

The simulation results show that the optimized simulation time can be reduced by half, from 23.5 seconds to 10.8 seconds, compared with that using the traditional genetic algorithm without disturbance. The influences of the number of the FBGs and the range of the tap coefficients of the FBGs are detailed studied. The amplitude frequency response of the MPF will deteriorate when the range of the tap coefficients of the FBGs become smaller.

The main feature of this method is to introduce a factorization of the error locator polynomial, which allowed us to reduce the number of components required to implement the algorithm of Chien Search Block of RS decoders on FPGA board and consequently reduces the power consumption with a percentage which can reach 50 % compared to the basic RS decoder. The design for Chien Search Block was created and the hardware description language source code was generated and simulated using Quartus software tools.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422825/6458502/06458514.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power error detection in the Chien Search Block for Reed-Solomon code","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Reed-Solomon codes","Logic gates","Mathematical model","Decoding","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error detection","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power error detection","Chien search block","Reed Solomon codes","communication system","data storage","disk error","RS decoder","factorization","error locator polynomial","FPGA board","power consumption","hardware description language source code","Quartus software tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reed-Solomon Coding","Chien Search Block","Error detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A low power error detection in the Chien Search Block for Reed-Solomon code","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308118","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low power error detection in the Chien Search Block for Reed-Solomon code","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"IDPaper203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066108S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422825","isNumber":"6458502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422825","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6458502","articleId":"6458514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6458518,"authors":[{"name":"Ali El Moussati","affiliation":["Equipe Signaux, National school of applied sciences, Oujda, Maroc"],"firstName":"Ali El","lastName":"Moussati","id":"37085435248"},{"name":"Kamal Ghoumid","affiliation":["Equipe Signaux, National school of applied sciences, Oujda, Maroc"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Ghoumid","id":"38193004500"},{"name":"Jamal Zaidouni","affiliation":["Equipe Signaux, National school of applied sciences, Oujda, Maroc"],"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Zaidouni","id":"38096689100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4766-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4764-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4765-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6458518","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Turbo codes","Digital signal processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Bit error rate","Fading","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","AWGN channels","error statistics","intersymbol interference","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","performance evaluation","Rayleigh channels","software radio","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","turbo code-OFDM","software defined radio","wireless turbo code OFDM","TC-OFDM","small form factor SFF SDR platform","Lyrtech and Texas Instrument","channels communication system","BER","performance analysis","performance evaluation","AWGN","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","single carrier OFDM system","turbo codes","residual inter symbol interference","ISI","inter channel interference","ICI","cyclic prefix","data rate transmission","bit error rate performance","bandwidth efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wirless LANs","Forward Error Correction","Turbo codes","OFDM","MBDK SIMULINK","Software Defined Radio"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present design and implementation of wireless Turbo Code OFDM (TC-OFDM) on the Small Form Factor (SFF) Software defined Radio (SDR) Platform, provided by Lyrtech and Texas Instrument (TI) [1]. TC-OFDM is proposed in different channels communication system in order to decrease the bit error rate (BER). The performance analysis of the TC-OFDM system is evaluated by simulations in different channels including AWGN and multipath Rayleigh fading channel. We show that TC-OFDM can provide a better performance than single carrier OFDM system in multipath Rayleigh fading charnels. On the other hand, Turbo codes can eliminate the residual inter symbol interference (ISI) and inter channel interference (ICI) and therefore reduce the length of the required Cyclic prefix in an OFDM system. Moreover, this decreases the overhead associated with the Cyclic Prefix. The use of Turbo codes in OFDM system for high data rate transmission in wireless LANs, results in a considerable improvement in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458518","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422825/6458502/06458518.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation for Turbo code-OFDM using Software defined Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458518/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation for Turbo code-OFDM using Software defined Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291780","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458518/","conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation for Turbo code-OFDM using Software defined Radio","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"IDPaper254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056686S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422825","isNumber":"6458502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422825","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6458502","articleId":"6458518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6458520,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef.

Each PMSG of the wind farm is connected to the DC-bus through a rectifier, but the DC-bus is connected to the grid through only one DC/AC inverter. The proposed control strategy is introduced aiming in both Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control method and Direct Torque Control (DTC). The PMSG side converters are used to achieve MPPT. The reference speeds of the generators are dynamically modified according to the wind speeds so as to maintain the wind turbines at maximum power operating point. The grid-side converter regulates DC-link voltage and injects the generated power into the AC network. Direct power control of PWM inverter is adopted. Grid-side reactive and active power decoupling method is applied to regulate the grid-side power factor.

OFDM transmits data by using a large number of narrow bandwidth carriers. In an OFDM transmission system, each subcarrier is attenuated individually under the frequency-selective and fast fading channel if the same fixed transmission scheme is used for all OFDM subcarriers thus it results in highest attenuation and hence poor performance. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the adaptive modulation to get an understanding of the differences between fixed and adaptive modulations schemes. In this work adaptive modulation is implemented by dividing whole subcarriers into blocks of adjacent subcarriers. Based on calculated average instantaneous signal to noise (SNR) same modulation scheme is applied to all subcarriers of same block. Here average bit error rate (BER) performance of OFDM system under fixed modulation and adaptive modulation is observed. Average BER performance of these modulation techniques is observed with various inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) size and using simpler adaptive quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. The simulation results show that BER performance of OFDM system using adaptive modulation is better than fixed modulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458547","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422825/6458502/06458547.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER performance of OFDM system with adaptive modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458547/","displayDocTitle":"BER performance of OFDM system with adaptive modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308124","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458547/","conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance of OFDM system with adaptive modulation","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"IDpaper178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080773S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422825","isNumber":"6458502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422825","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6458502","articleId":"6458547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6458552,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Mountassir","affiliation":["LIR2M Laboratory, FST, Hassan 1st University, Settat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Mountassir","id":"38243492000"},{"name":"Bouchaib Nassereddine","affiliation":["RIME Laboratory, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Bouchaib","lastName":"Nassereddine","id":"37398527300"},{"name":"Abdelkrim Haqiq","affiliation":["LIR2M Laboratory, FST, Hassan 1st University, Settat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Abdelkrim","lastName":"Haqiq","id":"37601296600"},{"name":"Samir Bennani","affiliation":["RIME Laboratory, Mohammed V University of Agdal, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Bennani","id":"37085665878"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4766-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4764-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4765-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6458552","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Planning","Wireless mesh networks","Interference","Wireless communication","Throughput","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relays placement","wireless mesh networks","multi-objective optimization approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Mesh Networks","planning","improvement","multi-objective optimization","topology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458552","abstract":"Wireless mesh networks have seen a real progress because of their implementation at a low cost.

However, recent advances in digital signal processors (DSP) showed great performance improvements with very low power consumption, making it promising to perform a phased array beamforming in flexible software instead of analog or hardware solutions. VLIW DSP processors are powered by an instruction level parallelism (ILP), offering the possibility to execute multiple separate instructions in one clock cycle. Even so, there is a big challenge on associated compilers which cannot guarantee the best use of resources, and then decrease obtained performance. We describe in this paper an efficient assembly implementation scheme for the beamforming algorithm, which exploits at best the available hardware units so as to minimize the execution time. Our experimental results on the high-end TMS320C6678 VLIW TI DSP, reached an average gain of 77.5% for the number of needed clock cycles relatively to conventional compiled implementations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458502","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422825/6458502/06458555.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation scheme of a real-time radar beamformer on a VLIW DSP processor, TMS320C66x TI DSP implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6458555/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient implementation scheme of a real-time radar beamformer on a VLIW DSP processor, TMS320C66x TI DSP implementation","conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291807","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient implementation scheme of a real-time radar beamformer on a VLIW DSP processor, TMS320C66x TI DSP implementation","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"IDpaper192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106552S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422825","isNumber":"6458502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6458502","articleId":"6458555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6458565,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Assayad","affiliation":["RTSE team, ENSEM, University Hassan II, Casablanca, Morocco"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Assayad","id":"37273310900"},{"name":"Alain Girault","affiliation":["POPART team, INRIA, Saint Ismier, France"],"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Girault","id":"37273315300"},{"name":"Hamoudi Kalla","affiliation":["REDS team, University of Batna, Batna, Algeria"],"firstName":"Hamoudi","lastName":"Kalla","id":"37273315500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4766-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4764-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4765-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6458565","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of real-time embedded systems under reliability and power constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Reliability","Computer architecture","Power demand","Equations","Energy consumption","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow graphs","embedded systems","parallel architectures","power aware computing","scheduling","software architecture","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time embedded systems scheduling","reliability constraints","power constraints","tri-criteria scheduling heuristic","data-flow graph scheduling","parallel heterogeneous architectures","schedule length minimization","system reliability maximization","dependable systems","energy consumption minimization","autonomous systems","list scheduling heuristics","dynamic voltage scaling improvement","reliability improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed real-time systems","safety-critical systems","reliability","multi-criteria scheduling","heterogeneous systems","active software replication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458565","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new tri-criteria scheduling heuristic for scheduling data-flow graphs of operations onto parallel heterogeneous architectures according to three criteria: first the minimization of the schedule length crucial for real-time systems, second the maximization of the system reliability crucial for dependable systems, and third minimizing energy consumption crucial for autonomous systems.

However, in public cloud systems, several service providers may come from different administration domain out of the user control and may be untrustworthy. Hence, security of MapReduce computation is essential in public cloud systems. Additionally, MapReduce data-processing services are long-running, which increases the possibility that an attacker is able to compromise some workers and make them misbehave to corrupt the integrity of all computations allocated to these workers. Thus, the computation integrity is a major concern for Mapreduce user in public cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to ensure the computation integrity of MapReduce in public cloud computing environment. By using replication-based voting method and reputation-based trust management system, our mechanism can efficiently detect both collusive and non-collusive malicious workers and guarantee high computation accuracy with an acceptable overhead.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422825/6458502/06458583.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Result verification mechanism for MapReduce computation integrity in cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoCS.2012.6458583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Result verification mechanism for MapReduce computation integrity in cloud computing","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308142","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6458583/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Result verification mechanism for MapReduce computation integrity in cloud computing","confLoc":"Agadir, Morocco","sourcePdf":"IDpaper269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094756S","chronDate":"5-6 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422825","isNumber":"6458502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422825","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6458502","articleId":"6458583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6458591,"authors":[{"name":"Ibtissam Akhchaf","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Information and TelecommunicationsSystems Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Ibtissam","lastName":"Akhchaf","id":"37403713500"},{"name":"Samira Khoulji","affiliation":["Department of Statistics and Informatics, Faculty of Polydisciplinary, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Samira","lastName":"Khoulji","id":"38546727400"},{"name":"Mohamed Essaaidi","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Information and TelecommunicationsSystems Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences, Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Essaaidi","id":"37396073400"},{"name":"Mohamed Larbi Kerkeb","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences of Tetouan, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed Larbi","lastName":"Kerkeb","id":"38547169200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4766-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4764-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4765-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6458591","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Wireless communication","Low-noise amplifiers","Receivers","Transceivers","Transistors","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","radio receivers","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-chip tri-band low-noise amplifier","cellular transceiver","wireless applications","WLAN","WiFi receivers","WiMax receivers","wireless communication","GSM","Zigbee","Bluetooth","Wi-Fi","HiperLAN","UWB","frequency 1.9 GHz","frequency 2.4 GHz","frequency 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks and Telecommunications","System Radio Frequency (RF)","wireless communication","3G and 4G Networks","Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA)","band-pass filter (BPF)","dual band amplifiers","tri-band amplifiers","Advanced Design System (ADS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458591","abstract":"In this paper the aim is to design and simulate a novel and single Chip consists of a tri-band low noise amplifier (LNA) operating simultaneously at three frequency bands 1.9 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz for WLAN, WiFi and WiMax receivers, is designed and presented in this paper.

The model adopts the voltage mode method for reducing the voltage swing during the write operation switching activity. Dynamic power dissipation increases when the operating frequency of the SRAM cell increases. In the proposed design we use two voltage sources connected with the Bit line and Bit bar line for reducing the voltage swing during the write \u201c0\u201d or write \u201c1\u201d operation. We use 90 nm CMOS technology with 1 volt of power supply. Simulation is done in Microwind 3.1 by using BSim4 model. Dynamic power for different frequencies is calculated. We compare it with conventional 6-T SRAM cell. The simulation results show that the power dissipation is almost constant even the frequency of the proposed SRAM model increases. This justifies the reduction of the dynamic power dissipation for high frequency CMOS VLSI design.","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6427391/6458612/06458621.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power CMOS voltage mode SRAM cell for high speed VLSI design","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A low power CMOS voltage mode SRAM cell for high speed VLSI design","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308495","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6458621/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low power CMOS voltage mode SRAM cell for high speed VLSI design","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054198S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6458635,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Acharya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Acharya","id":"38236090500"},{"name":"Sukadev Meher","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sukadev","lastName":"Meher","id":"37975380300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5067-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5065-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5066-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-2160"}],"articleNumber":"6458635","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"Most of the existing interpolation techniques available in the literature provide an undesirable blurring effect while converting a low resolution video to its high resolution counterpart. To overcome this problem, a new adaptive unsharp masking based interpolation technique is proposed here. The proposed method is a spatial domain pre-processing approach that extracts high frequency details in the spatial domain, sharpens the sub-sampled video to a certain degree through an adaptive selection of weight factor so as to compensate the blurring caused by the subsequent discrete cosine transform (DCT) based interpolation technique. The weight factor is determined adaptively for the first sub-sampled video frame by referring the corresponding original frame. Now, by exploiting the high correlation property of a video sequence, the same weight factor is utilized for sharpening the other sub-sampled video frames for restoring the fine details and critical edge information in the reconstructed video. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method shows an improvement up to 0.365 dB than DCT and a significant improvement up to 1.4 dB than the popular Bicubic interpolation technique in terms of average peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) at 4:1 compression ratio with improved visual quality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Discrete cosine transforms","PSNR","Video sequences","Frequency domain analysis","Asia","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","discrete cosine transforms","image resolution","image restoration","image sampling","image sequences","interpolation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive unsharp masking-based interpolation","video intraframe up-sampling","blurring effect","low resolution video","high resolution counterpart","spatial domain preprocessing approach","video subsampling","adaptive weight factor selection","discrete cosine transform-based interpolation technique","DCT-based interpolation technique","video sequence high correlation property","video frames restoration","critical edge information","video reconstruction","bicubic interpolation technique","peak-signal-to-noise-ratio","visual quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image and video processing","Video interpolation","Unsharp masking","Discrete cosine transform (DCT)","up-sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458635","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6427391/6458612/06458635.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient, adaptive unsharp masking based interpolation for video intra frame up-sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient, adaptive unsharp masking based interpolation for video intra frame up-sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458635/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458635/","accessionNumber":"13308509","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient, adaptive unsharp masking based interpolation for video intra frame up-sampling","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043783S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6458636,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Various applications, such as medical imaging, multispectral imaging such as remotely sensed imagery, satellite imagery, mobile multimedia communication, 3G cellular telephony, client-server networking, e-commerce, digital cinema, and others, require high speed, high performance EBCOT architecture. EBCOT encoder consist Tier-1 (block coder) and Tier-2 coding. The block coder is further partitioned into bit plane coder (BPC) and matrix quantizer (MQ) coder. The input to BPC is quantized DWT coefficients, which are stored in code block (CB) memory. BPC produces a context and decision (CXD) pair for each bit in the CB memory. The MQ coder processes these pairs and produces a compressed bit stream. Finally, as per the user's requirement, Tier-2 organizes this bit stream and generates compressed data. Though efficient EBCOT architectures have been proposed, throughput is low. To solve this problem, we used concurrent context generation. Therefore, all samples encoded in a stripe-column concurrently. As a consequence, high throughput is attained. The entire design of BPC encoder is tested on Virtex-5 XC5VLX50-1ff676 Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform using Verilog-HDL. This BPC architecture design can operate at 91.152MHz speed.","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458637","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6427391/6458612/06458637.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Pass-parallel VLSI architecture of BPC for embedded block coder in JPEG2000","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308511","htmlLink":"/document/6458637/","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pass-parallel VLSI architecture of BPC for embedded block coder in JPEG2000","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077736S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6458639,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Neural networks, with their remarkable ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data, can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques. One of the advantages of the neural network is Adaptive learning, i.e., the ability to learn and perform tasks based on the given data provided for training or the initial experience. The focus of this paper is the implementation of one such learning algorithm known as Forward Only Computation using Analog blocks like analog multiplier, tan-sigmoid function, subtractors, etc. The reasons for using the forward only computation algorithm and the ways it overcomes the problems faced by the EBP (Error Back Propagation) algorithm and other second order algorithms like the LM (Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm are explained in this paper. The multiplier used here is a double balanced Gilbert multiplier and the activation function used is tan sigmoid function. Another implementation of the tan sigmoid function is incorporated here, wherein it is used as a multiplier having one differential input and one single ended input (given as a bias). The neural network has been simulated using HSPICE for a period of 2ms and the converging of the weights has been observed.","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458642","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6427391/6458612/06458642.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog VLSI design of neural network architecture for implementation of forward only computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458642/","displayDocTitle":"Analog VLSI design of neural network architecture for implementation of forward only computation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308516","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458642/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog VLSI design of neural network architecture for implementation of forward only computation","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049101S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6458647,"authors":[{"name":"Rashmi Ramesh Rachh","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science KLESCET, Belgaum, India"],"firstName":"Rashmi Ramesh","lastName":"Rachh","id":"38096347400"},{"name":"P.

Low cost and feasibly better improvement can be achieved by using power electronics based devices in the system. Such devices are called Flexible Alternating Current Transmission system (FACTS) devices. Available Transfer Capability (ATC) is what exactly the allowable power limit to accommodate new users without violating the commitments of the existing users. Thus in the deregulated environment, this transfer capability is of more concern. ATC is a dependent factor on the system thermal, stability and voltage limits. With the introduction of FACTS devices, the line overloads, bus voltage problems are considerably brought down. Series compensators like Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitors (TCSC) are used for line flow controls. The ATC can be increased by adjusting the settings of the FACTS device (such as reactance, phase angles, reactive power injection) with respect to the system parameters. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary technique that is used to solve multi objective optimization problem. In this paper PSO technique is used to estimate the feasible optimal setting [2] for the TCSC device to enhance the power transfer capability of the system to an appreciable limit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458650/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13308524","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458650/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Available transfer capability enhancement by using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm based FACTS allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Available transfer capability enhancement by using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm based FACTS allocation","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060398S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6458657,"authors":[{"name":"Manda Rajarao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, ICFAI University, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Manda","lastName":"Rajarao","id":"37063189800"},{"name":"R V Raja Kumar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"R V Raja","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37272666600"},{"name":"Divya Madhuri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, AIET, Visakhapatnam, India"],"firstName":"Divya","lastName":"Madhuri","id":"38547848200"},{"name":"Madhavi Latha","affiliation":["GITAM University, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Madhavi","lastName":"Latha","id":"38548706900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5067-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5065-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5066-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-2160"}],"articleNumber":"6458657","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient channel estimation technique for LTE air interface","abstract":"This paper discuss the channel estimation and data detection for Long Term Evolution (LTE) air interface over time varying frequency selective channels using a modified superimposed training (SIT) sequence method. This method can be significantly improved the accuracy by exploiting time and frequency correlations between the channel frequency response coefficients (coherence time and coherence bandwidth). In SIT based channel estimation scheme, training sequence is arithmetically added to the data sequence at a desired power allocation ratio at the transmitter. At the receiver the channel estimation is done by using the same SIT sequence with iterative process. The simulation results shows that the proposed method is superior than the conventional channel estimation method (2-D pilot based method) and previous proposed SIT based method for higher order modulation and high mobility cases.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6427391/6458612/06458657.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458657","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458657","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","OFDM","Correlation","Time frequency analysis","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency response","iterative methods","Long Term Evolution","modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation technique","LTE air interface","data detection","Long Term Evolution","time-varying frequency selective channels","modified superimposed training sequence method","SIT sequence method","frequency correlations","channel frequency response coefficients","SIT based channel estimation scheme","power allocation ratio","transmitter","receiver","iterative process","2D pilot based method","higher order modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","OFDMA","SIT","coherence time","coherence bandwidth","MMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458657/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient channel estimation technique for LTE air interface","accessionNumber":"13308531","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6458657/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient channel estimation technique for LTE air interface","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04407S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6458658,"authors":[{"name":"M Jagadeshwar Rao","affiliation":["Centre for VLSI Design, Padmasri Dr.B.V.Raju Institute of Technology, Medak, A.P, India"],"firstName":"M Jagadeshwar","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085942575"},{"name":"Sanjay Dubey","affiliation":["ECE Dept., Padmasri Dr.B.V.Raju Institute of Technology, Medak, A.P, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Dubey","id":"38547959300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5067-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5065-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5066-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-2160"}],"articleNumber":"6458658","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2494},"abstract":"A Wallace tree multiplier using Booth Recoder is proposed in this paper. It is an improved version of tree based Wallace tree multiplier architecture. This paper aims at additional reduction of latency and area of the Wallace tree multiplier.

The result shows that the proposed architecture is around 67 percent faster than the existing Wallace-tree multiplier, 53 percent faster than the Vedic multiplier, 22 percent faster than the radix-8 Booth multiplier, 18 percent faster than the radix-16 Booth Multiplier. In terms of area also, the proposed multiplier is much efficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6427391/6458612/06458658.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics and Electronics","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2012.6458658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6458612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high speed and area efficient Booth recoded Wallace tree multiplier for fast arithmetic circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Computer architecture","Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Equations","Signal processing algorithms","Asia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast arithmetic circuits","Booth recoder","tree based Wallace tree multiplier architecture","compressor adders","Verilog HDL","Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA device","Vedic multiplier","radix-8 Booth multiplier","radix-16 Booth multiplier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arithmetic","Booth Encoder","Compressors","Radix-8","Wallace-Tree"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A high speed and area efficient Booth recoded Wallace tree multiplier for fast arithmetic circuits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458658/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308532","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high speed and area efficient Booth recoded Wallace tree multiplier for fast arithmetic circuits","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"PA046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05893S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6427391","isNumber":"6458612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6427391","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6458612","articleId":"6458658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6458941,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The countermeasures are security best practice that are appropriate to the organisations risk appetite and the business requirements. The security posture is defined by an organisations security policy and its mission statement and business objectives. Countermeasures come with a cost which should not exceed the value of the resources they are protecting and they should be effective, provide value for money, and a return on investment for the organisation Measuring how the organisations actual security posture relates to its agreed acceptable level of risk is a problem that is faced by organisations when looking at whether their countermeasures are effective and providing value for money and a return on investment. There are two methodologies that can be used. 1. Auditing - which is the mechanism of confirming that the processes or procedures agree to a master checklist for compliance 2. Assessing - is a more active, or intrusive, testing methodology to adequately assess your processes or procedures that cannot be adequately verified using a checklist or security policy This paper investigates the surface attack area of an organisations infrastructure and applications examining the cases where the use of cloud and mobile computing have extend the infrastructure beyond the traditional perimeter of organisations physical locations and the challenges this causes in assessing the security posture. A review of the use of assessment methodologies such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to assess the infrastructure and application security posture of an organisation shows how they can provide identification of vulnerabilities which can aid the risk assessment process in developing a security policy. It will demonstrate how these methodologies can help in assessing the effectiveness of the implemented countermeasures and aid in evaluation as to whether there are provide value for money and a return on investment. It is proposed that a long term strategy of using both methodologies for assessing the security posture based on the business requirements will provide the following benefits. : Cost effective monitoring of the infrastructure and security posture. : Ensuring that the countermeasures retain effectiveness over time. : Responding to the continual changing threat environment. : Ensuring that value for money and return on investment are maintained.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2012.1503","publicationTitle":"7th IET International Conference on System Safety, incorporating the Cyber Security Conference 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"7th IET International Conference on System Safety, incorporating the Cyber Security Conference 2012","pdfPath":"/iel7/6485038/6494528/06458945.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6494528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2012.1503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost effective assessment of the infrastructure security posture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cost effective assessment of the infrastructure security posture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458945/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13245261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost effective assessment of the infrastructure security posture","confLoc":"Edinburgh","sourcePdf":"20121503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059457S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","isNumber":"6494528","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6485038","articleId":"6458945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6458949,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A solution is to use representative models and virtualisation however the paper explains that it is necessary to be clear what side effects this might have.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2012.1521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6494528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2012.1521","publicationTitle":"7th IET International Conference on System Safety, incorporating the Cyber Security Conference 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"7th IET International Conference on System Safety, incorporating the Cyber Security Conference 2012","pdfPath":"/iel7/6485038/6494528/06458960.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System security assessment using a cyber range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"System security assessment using a cyber range","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13245276","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System security assessment using a cyber range","confLoc":"Edinburgh","sourcePdf":"20121521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024933S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2012","isNumber":"6494528","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6485038","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6458960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6458963,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

We propose several robust methods that do not require previous measurement campaigns when a network is deployed. The focus is on networks of ultrawideband sensors, but the proposed range-based methods can also be applied to other types of sensor networks. The location of a target node is estimated from measured distances to anchor nodes of known positions. We allow for the possibility of large errors in the range measurements due to undetected direct path (UDP) propagation conditions. In mitigating the UDP effect, our approach is to combine intermediate location estimates from different subsets of beacons. We propose novel criteria for identifying the combinations that produce bad estimates. These combinations are then discarded in obtaining the final estimates. Simulations reveal that the proposed methods achieve improved performance with respect to that of existing techniques that exploit the same prior information. Under many scenarios, the proposed methods reach the performance of some algorithms that exploit more prior information.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2246359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6486560/06458976.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6486560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2246359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","startPage":"1979","endPage":"1987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Localization With Range-Based Measurements and Little Prior Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Localization With Range-Based Measurements and Little Prior Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458976/","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6458976/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13427875","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Localization With Range-Based Measurements and Little Prior Information","sourcePdf":"jsen-ariasdereyna-2246359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065013S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6486560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6486560","articleId":"6458976","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6458978,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6477092/6458978/6458978-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian (S'11) received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in mechanical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran-Iran, respectively in 2007 and 2010, where he worked on different applications of control systems and robotics.

With the help of these constructs, we formulate an estimator where measurement and predictor-fusion are implemented over \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b1</sub>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b2</sub>\n, respectively, and show that the proposed scheme leads to distributed observability, i.e., observability of the distributed estimator. In order to characterize the estimator further, we show that Type-\u03b1 agents only exist in systems with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>\n-rank (maximal rank of zero/non-zero pattern) deficient system matrices. In other words, systems with full \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>\n-rank matrices only have Type-\u03b2 agents, and thus, a strongly-connected (agent) network is sufficient for full \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>\n-rank systems-by the definition of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b2</sub>\n above; however strong-connectivity is not necessary, i.e., there exist weakly-connected networks that result in distributed observability. Furthermore, we show that for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>\n -rank deficient systems, measurement-fusion over \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b1</sub>\n is required, and predictor-fusion alone is insufficient. The approach taken in this paper is structural, i.e., we use the concept of structured systems theory and generic observability to derive the results. Finally, we provide an iterative method to compute the local estimator gain at each agent once the observability is ensured using the aforementioned construction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2246135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6477092/06458978.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"204","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2246135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Genericity Properties in Distributed Estimation: Topology Design and Sensor Placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Genericity Properties in Distributed Estimation: Topology Design and Sensor Placement","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6458978/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13382428","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Genericity Properties in Distributed Estimation: Topology Design and Sensor Placement","sourcePdf":"jstsp-khan-2246135-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107498S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6477092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6477092","articleId":"6458978","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6458979,"authors":[{"name":"Amitav Mukherjee","affiliation":["Hitachi America Limited, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6477092/6458979/6458979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amitav Mukherjee (S'06\u2013M'12) received the B.S. degree from the University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, in 2005, the M.S. degree from Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, in 2012, all in electrical engineering.","Dr. Mukherjee is currently with the Wireless Systems Research Laboratory of Hitachi America Ltd., Santa Clara, CA.

The users can individually choose whether or not to participate in cooperative spectrum sensing, in order to maximize their individual payoff defined in terms of the sensing false-alarm rate and transmit energy expenditure. The system is modeled as a partially connected network with a statistical distribution of the degree of the users, who play their myopic best responses to the actions of their neighbors at each iteration. Based on this model, we investigate the existence and characterization of Bayesian Nash Equilibria for the diffusion game. The impacts of network topology, channel fading statistics, sensing protocol, and multiple antennas on the outcome of the diffusion process are analyzed next. Simulation results that demonstrate how conducive different network scenarios are to the diffusion of cooperation are presented for further insight, and we conclude with a discussion on additional refinements and issues worth pursuing.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2246136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6477092/06458979.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2013.2246136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"175","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion of Cooperative Behavior in Decentralized Cognitive Radio Networks With Selfish Spectrum Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion of Cooperative Behavior in Decentralized Cognitive Radio Networks With Selfish Spectrum Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458979/","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6458979/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13382429","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion of Cooperative Behavior in Decentralized Cognitive Radio Networks With Selfish Spectrum Sensors","sourcePdf":"jstsp-mukherjee-2246136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111699S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6477092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6477092","articleId":"6458979","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6458983,"authors":[{"name":"Mats Skold","affiliation":["EXFO Sweden AB, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Skold","id":"37313499800"},{"name":"Greg Raybon","affiliation":["Bell Laboratory, Alcatel-Lucent, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Raybon","id":"37266739900"},{"name":"Andrew L.

Three respiratory-induced variations (frequency, intensity, and amplitude) are extracted from the PPG using the Incremental-Merge Segmentation algorithm. Frequency content of each respiratory-induced variation is analyzed using fast Fourier transforms. The proposed Smart Fusion method then combines the results of the three respiratory-induced variations using a transparent mean calculation. It automatically eliminates estimations considered to be unreliable because of detected presence of artifacts in the PPG or disagreement between the different individual respiratory rate estimations. The algorithm has been tested on data obtained from 29 children and 13 adults. Results show that it is important to combine the three respiratory-induced variations for robust estimation of respiratory rate. The Smart Fusion showed trends of improved estimation (mean root mean square error 3.0 breaths/min) compared to the individual estimation methods (5.8, 6.2, and 3.9 breaths/min). The Smart Fusion algorithm is being implemented in a mobile phone pulse oximeter device to facilitate the diagnosis of severe childhood pneumonia in remote areas.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2246160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6532373/06458992.pdf","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2246160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6532373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiparameter Respiratory Rate Estimation From the Photoplethysmogram","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6458992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458992/","displayDocTitle":"Multiparameter Respiratory Rate Estimation From the Photoplethysmogram","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13583231","pubMedId":"23399950","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458992/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiparameter Respiratory Rate Estimation From the Photoplethysmogram","sourcePdf":"tbme-karlen-2246160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084101S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6532373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"6532373","articleId":"6458992","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6458995,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos N.

The approach can be used for making a uniform distribution of cells inside the chamber to allow the study of a variety of biological processes, including cell signaling. Fluid forces inside the chamber, modeled using computational fluid dynamics, are incorporated into the widely used Langevin equation to simulate the motion of cells. The developed simulator was used for building a map that contains probabilities of a cell successfully reaching one of the outlets of the chamber from different locations under the influence of the fluid flow. The developed planner not only generates collision-free paths that exploit the fluid flow inside the chamber but also utilizes the offline generated simulation data to decide suitable locations for releasing the cells. This ensures fast and robust cell transport, while minimizing the required laser power and operational time. The planner is based on the heuristic D* Lite algorithm that employs a specific cost function for searching over a novel state-action space representation. The effectiveness of the planning algorithm is demonstrated using both simulation and physical experiments in a microfluidics-optical tweezers hybrid manipulation setup.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6458998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6458998/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13811290","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated Cell Transport in Optical Tweezers-Assisted Microfluidic Chambers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Cell Transport in Optical Tweezers-Assisted Microfluidic Chambers","sourcePdf":"tase-gupta-2239287-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136588S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6617709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6617709","articleId":"6458998","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459000,"authors":[{"name":"Ruonan Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6472304/6459000/6459000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruonan Han (S'10) was born in Hohhot, China, in 1984.

Within 20-GHz range, the fluctuation of the measured output power is less than 1.5 dB, and the simulated 3-dB output bandwidth is 70 GHz (14.6%). The doubler is fabricated using 65-nm low-power bulk CMOS technology and consumes near zero dc power.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6472304/06459000.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2243465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2243465","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Power Broadband Passive Terahertz Frequency Doubler in CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459000/","displayDocTitle":"A High-Power Broadband Passive Terahertz Frequency Doubler in CMOS","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459000/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13355108","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Power Broadband Passive Terahertz Frequency Doubler in CMOS","sourcePdf":"tmtt-han-2243465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113102S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6472304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6472304","articleId":"6459000","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459001,"authors":[{"name":"Komail Nekooei","affiliation":["Kerman University, Kerman, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6471805/6459001/6459001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Komail Nokooei received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Kerman University, Iran, in 2003.

The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system \u201cseen\u201d by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system. Results obtained on the 68-bus New England/New York benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations without additional control effort.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","volume":"4","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13355379","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459002/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Local Area Signals Based Damping of Power System Oscillations Using Virtual Generators and Approximate Dynamic Programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Local Area Signals Based Damping of Power System Oscillations Using Virtual Generators and Approximate Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tsg-molina-2233224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074815S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6471805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6471805","articleId":"6459002","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6459003,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6627992/6459003/6459003-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoming Chen received the B.Sc. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.

This paper uses the spatial degrees of freedom method to estimate the independent sample number. Comparing with the commonly used autocorrelation function method, the proposed method requires less computation time and provides a smaller estimation bias for correlated samples and a smaller estimation variance once above a certain sample number. The estimated independent sample number can be used to explain the dependences of the measurement uncertainty on frequency, mode stirrers, and RC loading. Finally, the estimated independent sample number is used to predict the standard deviation (STD) of the average power level for different loading configurations, where good agreements are observed.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2013.2242473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2013.2242473","startPage":"816","endPage":"824","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6627992/06459003.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6627992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Investigation of the Number of Independent Samples and the Measurement Uncertainty in a Reverberation Chamber","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigation of the Number of Independent Samples and the Measurement Uncertainty in a Reverberation Chamber","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2013","volume":"55","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459003/","accessionNumber":"13842546","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459003/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigation of the Number of Independent Samples and the Measurement Uncertainty in a Reverberation Chamber","sourcePdf":"temc-chen-2242473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087725S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6627992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6627992","articleId":"6459003","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6459009,"authors":[{"name":"Imen Bahri","affiliation":["Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique de Paris (LGEP), University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6631519/6459009/6459009-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Imen Bahri (M'13) was born in Tunisia in 1982.

Among these guidelines, an efficient Hw/Sw partitioning procedure is presented. This Hw/Sw partitioning is performed taking into account both the control requirements (bandwidth and stability margin) and the architectural constraints (e.g., available area, memory, and hardware multipliers). A nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the corresponding multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed Hw/Sw partitioning approach is then validated on a sensorless control algorithm for a synchronous motor based on an extended Kalman filter. Among the nondominated implementation solutions supplied by the NSGA-II, those that are considered as the most interesting are synthesized. Their time/area performances after synthesis are compared with success to their predictions. In addition, one of these optimal solutions is also tested on an experimental setup.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6631519/06459009.pdf","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2013.2245908","doi":"10.1109/TII.2013.2245908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/Software Codesign Guidelines for System on Chip FPGA-Based Sensorless AC Drive Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/Software Codesign Guidelines for System on Chip FPGA-Based Sensorless AC Drive Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459009/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459009/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843494","volume":"9","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/Software Codesign Guidelines for System on Chip FPGA-Based Sensorless AC Drive Applications","sourcePdf":"tii-bahri-2245908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080274S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6631519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6631519","articleId":"6459009","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459018,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6490370/6459018/6459018-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaolong Li received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, the M.S. degree from the Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from ENS de Cachan, Cachan, France, in 1999, 2002, and 2006, respectively.","He is currently a researcher with the Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, where he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow from 2007 to 2009.

Moreover, by taking specific shifting and embedding functions, we show that several RDH algorithms reported in the literature are special cases of this general construction.

We model the output of this \u201ccompressive matched filter\u201d as a random process whose mean equals the scaled, shifted autocorrelation function of the template signal. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we prove that the expected maximum deviation of this process from its mean decreases sharply as the number of measurements increases, and we also derive a probabilistic tail bound on the maximum deviation. Putting all of this together, we bound the minimum number of measurements required to guarantee that the empirical maximum of this random process occurs sufficiently close to the true peak of its mean function. We conclude that for broad classes of signals, this compressive matched filter will successfully estimate the unknown delay (with high probability and within a prescribed tolerance) using a number of random frequency-domain samples that scales inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio and only logarithmically in the observation bandwidth and the possible range of delays.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6516641/06459025.pdf","startPage":"3475","endPage":"3496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2243495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2243495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matched Filtering From Limited Frequency Samples","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random processes","Frequency domain analysis","Delay","Correlation","Time domain analysis","Frequency estimation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay estimation","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filtering","limited frequency samples","correlation-based strategy","unknown delay estimation","signal amplitude","noisy frequency-domain samples","randomly chosen frequency-domain samples","compressive matched filter","shifted autocorrelation function","template signal","probabilistic tail","random frequency-domain samples"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing (CS)","matched filtering","random processes","tone estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Matched Filtering From Limited Frequency Samples","volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13499512","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched Filtering From Limited Frequency Samples","sourcePdf":"tit-wakin-2243495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057009S","chronDate":"June  2013","isNumber":"6516641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","articleId":"6459025","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459026,"authors":[{"name":"Xiugang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Xiugang Wu (S'08) received the B.

Recently, several modified compress-and-forward relay schemes were proposed, where the destination jointly decodes the compression and the message, instead of successively. Such a modification on the decoding process was motivated by realizing that it is generally easier to decode the compression jointly with the original message, and more importantly, the original message can be decoded even without completely decoding the compression. Thus, joint decoding provides more freedom in choosing the compression at the relay. However, the question remains in these modified compress-and-forward relay schemes-whether this freedom of selecting the compression necessarily improves the achievable rate of the original message. It has been shown by El Gamal and Kim in 2010 that the answer is negative in the single-relay case. In this paper, it is further demonstrated that in the case of multiple relays, there is no improvement on the achievable rate by joint decoding either. More interestingly, it is discovered that any compressions not supporting successive decoding will actually lead to strictly lower achievable rates for the original message. Therefore, to maximize the achievable rate for the original message, the compressions should always be chosen to support successive decoding. Furthermore, it is shown that any compressions not completely decodable even with joint decoding will not provide any contribution to the decoding of the original message. The above phenomenon is also shown to exist under the repetitive encoding framework recently proposed by Lim , which improved the achievable rate in the case of multiple relays. Here, another interesting discovery is that the improvement is not a result of repetitive encoding, but the benefit of delayed decoding after all the blocks have been finished. The same rate is shown to be achievable with the simpler classical encoding process of Cover and El Gamal with a block-by-block backward decoding process.","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6504538/06459026.pdf","startPage":"2613","endPage":"2628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2241818","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2241818","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Relays","Encoding","Joints","Materials","Vectors","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","optimisation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal compressions","compress-and-forward relay schemes","message decoding","achievable rate maximization","repetitive encoding framework","delayed decoding","block-by-block backward decoding process","compression-message successive decoding","compression-message joint decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backward decoding","compress-and-forward","compression-message joint decoding","compression-message successive decoding","multiple-relay channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimal Compressions in the Compress-and-Forward Relay Schemes","accessionNumber":"13448811","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459026/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimal Compressions in the Compress-and-Forward Relay Schemes","sourcePdf":"tit-xie-2241818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087439S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6504538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6504538","articleId":"6459026","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6459034,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

It shows that the eccentricity does not affect the back-EMF and electromagnetic torque of rotational symmetrical machines whose configuration repeats every certain amount of angle. However, it significantly distorts the back-EMF and torque waveforms of rotational asymmetric machines. Further, the static eccentricity does not change the harmonic contents of back-EMF, but results in unbalanced three phase back-EMF. Hence, the temporal order of the main torque ripple due to the static eccentricity is equal to the pole number. On the other hand, the rotating eccentricity results in more back-EMF harmonics of orders equal to the PM magnetisation order plus/minus one. Therefore, the temporal order of the main torque ripple due to the rotating eccentricity is equal to the triplen number closest to the pole number. The prediction is validated by the experiment.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6566069/06459034.pdf","startPage":"4927","endPage":"4936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2246181","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2246181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6566069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion of Back-EMF and Torque of PM Brushless Machines Due to Eccentricity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distortion of Back-EMF and Torque of PM Brushless Machines Due to Eccentricity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459034/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459034/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13739218","volume":"49","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion of Back-EMF and Torque of PM Brushless Machines Due to Eccentricity","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhu-2246181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157598S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6566069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6566069","articleId":"6459034","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459035,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6746080/6459035/6459035-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuang Liu received the B.Sc. degree from the Department of Precision Machinery and Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Joint Research Center of the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, and the University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou, China, in 2010.","Since 2010, he has been a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong.

Recently, different STFD estimators have been proposed, which, based on simulations, are claimed to be robust. In this paper, we provide an influence function robustness analysis of STFD estimators. We derive the influence functions for the asymptotic and for the finite-sample case and study robustness of the standard, as well as for some recently proposed robust STFD estimators. The empirical influence function gives practitioners a simple way to pre-select STFD estimators for their scenario. Our analysis confirms that, unlike for the standard estimator, the proposed robust estimators yield a bounded influence function and are robust over a broad class of distributions. Future research on STFD estimation will allow for the design of robust and efficient estimators based on the influence function.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April15, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13396871","htmlLink":"/document/6459046/","displayDocTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Spatial Time-Frequency Distributions Based on the Influence Function","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Analysis of Spatial Time-Frequency Distributions Based on the Influence Function","sourcePdf":"tsp-muma-2246155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116362S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6482682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6482682","articleId":"6459046","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6459048,"authors":[{"name":"Guangjie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6482682/6459048/6459048-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guangjie Huang (S'12) received the B.E. and M.Eng. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","Since August 2009, he has been pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL.

Because of the high computational complexity of ECC functions, dedicated hardware architecture is essential to provide sufficient ECC performance. Besides, crypto-ICs are vulnerable to side-channel information leakage because the private key can be revealed via power-analysis attacks. In this paper, a new heterogeneous dual-processing-element (dual-PE) architecture and a priority-oriented scheduling of right-to-left double-and-add-always EC scalar multiplication (ECSM) with randomized processing technique are proposed to achieve a power-analysis-resistant dual-field ECC (DF-ECC) processor. For this dual-PE design, a memory hierarchy with local memory synchronization scheme is also exploited to improve data bandwidth.

A 3-D chip stacks a number of 2-D FPGA bare dies, interconnected by through-silicon vias (TSVs) and micro bumps, to attain a high packing density. However, the technology also introduces new types of defects, such as TSV void and microbump misalignment. Testing the interconnection faults becomes inevitable. In this paper, we present an automatic test pattern generator for open, short, and delay faults on 3-D FPGA interconnects by exploiting the regularity of switch matrix topology and forming repetitive paths with finite steps and with loop-back. The experimental results show that 12 test patterns (TPs) suffice to achieve 100% open fault coverage (FC). To detect all possible neighboring short faults, we need more than 40 TPs, whose number increases only slightly with the height of the 3-D FPGA. The TPs have high delay FC (96%) for 3-D FPGAs with the number of configurable logic blocks ranging from 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 2 to 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 6, demonstrating the scalability of our method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Vectors","Circuit faults","Integrated circuit interconnections","Through-silicon

two sources exchange information with the help of an intermediate relay. Based on the estimated signals from the two sources, the relay calculates the soft mutual information and then broadcasts it to the two sources. In particular, we propose two MIF protocols, namely, network-coded MIF (NC-MIF) and superposition-coded MIF (SC-MIF), which is suitable for different channel conditions. The expressions derived for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receivers reveal that, if both source-to-relay channels are in good condition, the NC-MIF outperforms the SC-MIF. Otherwise, the SC-MIF is superior to the NC-MIF. For the TWRC with varying channels, we further develop an adaptive scheme, which enables the dynamic switch between the two protocols, depending on the received SNR at the sources. Furthermore, the threshold that determines the switch of the protocols is developed as a close-form expression. Simulation results show that our adaptive scheme outperforms other protocols discussed in this paper over fading channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2246203","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2246203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6530672/06459053.pdf","startPage":"2374","endPage":"2381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Soft Information Forwarding Protocols in Two-Way Relay Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel Soft Information Forwarding Protocols in Two-Way Relay Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2013","accessionNumber":"13563767","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459053/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Soft Information Forwarding Protocols in Two-Way Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2246203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.241391S","chronDate":"Jun  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6530672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6530672","articleId":"6459053","onlineDate":"08 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459078,"authors":[{"name":"X.

In this paper, we present a new CR downlink beamforming method via combining filtering and NB techniques together, which enables CR to broaden and also deepen the nulls towards LU directions. Meanwhile, it also enlarges the width of the main beam to tolerate the DOA ambiguity of CR users. After employing the proposed method, CR directs the main beam towards its own users while putting deeper and wider nulls to the LU in the downlink beamforming. The proposed beamforming scheme causes less interference to LU while sharing the same spectrum.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459078","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423128/6459071/06459078.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459078","publicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink beamforming with broadened and deepened nulls for Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Downlink beamforming with broadened and deepened nulls for Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459078/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459078/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308540","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink beamforming with broadened and deepened nulls for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043547S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423128","isNumber":"6459071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423128","xplore-issue":"6459071","articleId":"6459078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459097,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiko Honjo","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Honjo","id":"37275579900"},{"name":"Ryo Ishikawa","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37603790600"},{"name":"Yoichiro Takayama","affiliation":["Advanced Wireless Communication Research Center, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichiro","lastName":"Takayama","id":"37300858400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-027-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2215-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-026-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6459097","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":855},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Gallium nitride","Power amplifiers","HEMTs","Wireless communication","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","inductive power transmission","microwave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrahigh efficiency microwave power amplifier","wireless power transmission","space solar-power satellite systems","wireless smart-grid short-distance power supply systems","voltage waveform control","current waveform control","reactive harmonic load amplifiers","inverse class-F","HEMT amplifier","power-added efficiency","frequency 5.8 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Efficiency Amplifier","Wireless Power Transmission","GaN HEMT","class-F","inverse class-F"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459097","abstract":"Realizing ultra-high-efficiency power amplifiers operating at 5.8 GHz is a key issue for wireless power transmission such as space solar-power satellite systems and wireless smart-grid short-distance power supply systems.

Herein, multiple antennas are applied at the reader and at the RFID tag as well. A method for the determination of the channel coefficients between all antennas is presented. The channel information is needed to apply MIMO techniques to enhance the data rate or the reliability or range of the backscatter link. Since no measurement can be conducted at the tag antenna ports the method is based on the theory of determining the scattering parameters of a multiport (n-port) with a reduced number of measurement ports. Herein, the load impedances within the RFID tag being normally used to transmit information via backscatter modulation are used as known reflection standards. An internal thru standard between the tag antenna ports is introduced to reduce phase ambiguities. The method could be applied in future generations of multi-antenna RFID tags or could be used to characterize the channel for MIMO RFID prototype systems to evaluate their performance limits e.g. by calculating the MIMO capacity.

The proposed model is based on the two-box modeling technique to alleviate the number of coefficient used in the model. Compared to the two-dimensional memory polynomial (2-D MP) model, the proposed model requires less coefficient, while maintaining the similar modeling performance, because the static nonlinearity and dynamic behavior are separately estimated. The modeling performances of the models are accessed in terms of the normalized mean square error and adjacent channel error power ratio. Moreover, the linearization capabilities of the models are compared by compensating the nonlinearities of the concurrent dual-band PA. In the experiment, the PA is excited by two wideband code division multiple access 1-FA signals at 1.8 GHz and 2.411 GHz. The modeling assessment and linearization performance clearly show that the proposed 2-D EH outperforms the 2-D MP.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423128/6459071/06459137.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1252","publicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D enhanced hammerstein behavior model for concurrent dual-band power amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Polynomials","Two dimensional displays","Multiaccess communication","Accuracy","Educational institutions","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mean square error methods","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D enhanced Hammerstein behavior model","concurrent dual-band power amplifiers","two-dimensional enhanced Hammerstein behavior model","concurrent dual-band PA","two-box modeling technique","two-dimensional memory polynomial model","2D MP model","static nonlinearity","dynamic behavior","normalized mean square error","adjacent channel error power ratio","linearization capability","wideband code division multiple access 1-FA signals","2D EH","2D MP","frequency 1.8 GHz","frequency 2.411 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"2-D enhanced hammerstein behavior model for concurrent dual-band power amplifiers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308585","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D enhanced hammerstein behavior model for concurrent dual-band power amplifiers","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042456S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","isNumber":"6459071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423128","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6459137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459148,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed F.

The proposed system is able to provide a large number of reconfigurable multiple levels by arbitrarily controlling the output power of the two efficient power amplifiers.

An algorithm is developed to optimise the different symmetrical levels depending on the actual signal statistics in order to boost average system efficiency. A multilevel LINC transmitter system demonstrator was build to validate the proposed concept. Besides The system employs two identical hybrid power amplifiers designed using GaN HEMTs for a centre frequency of 2.28 GHz and output power of 40 dBm, the system employs only off-the-shelf components or measurement equipment. Measurement results on the demonstrator show that compared with a conventional LINC transmitter, average power efficiency of the proposed system can be improved from 28 % to 41 % for a WCDMA signal with a measured adjacent-channel-power ratio (ACPR) below -45 dBc.

The proposed MIMO antenna system consists of two planar inverted-F antenna elements with high isolation between them. The high isolation is achieved by mirror symmetrical orientation of the developed printed inverted-F antenna elements relative to each other. This provides pattern diversity between the two different antenna elements. The antenna system is realized using the standard FR4 PCB substrate that leads to a low production cost. The occupied antenna area has the dimensions of 21.5 mm \u00d7 20 mm that is only a fraction of the operating wavelength (115 mm at 2.6 GHz). The designed MIMO antenna system has the bandwidth of more than 200 MHz at the reflection coefficient level below -8 dB. The isolation between the antenna elements across the radiation bandwidth exceeds 8.5 dB and the envelope correlation coefficient is lower than 0.1. Experimental measurements of the fabricated antenna system confirm the results of electromagnetic simulation.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459149","publicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423128/6459071/06459149.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459071","startPage":"408","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact planar inverted-F antenna system for MIMO USB dongle operating in 2.5\u20142.7 GHz band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compact planar inverted-F antenna system for MIMO USB dongle operating in 2.5\u20142.7 GHz band","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459149/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308595","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459149/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact planar inverted-F antenna system for MIMO USB dongle operating in 2.5\u20142.7 GHz band","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05922S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423128","isNumber":"6459071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423128","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6459071","articleId":"6459149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459152,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The technology used relies on 0.25-\u03bcm GaAs Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistors (PHEMT) of United Monolithic Semiconductors (UMS) foundry. A distributed approach is proposed in order to model this power cell. The challenge consists to obtain, with a better shape factor (ratio between the vertical and horizontal sizes of the transistor), the same performances than a single transistor with the same gate development. In order to design a 2W amplifier, we have used two 12\u00d7100 \u03bcm transistors. Cascode vertical size is 413 \u03bcm whereas a transistor with the same gate development exhibits a vertical size of 790 \u03bcm. Therefore the shape factor is nearly one as compared to a shape factor of 4 for a classical parallel architecture.

The efficiency and bandwidth of the modulator is mainly limited by the linear stage. This paper proposes a method to improve the performance of the linear stage by adding another stage. The third stage is a push-pull amplifier biased in class-B mode. The push-pull amplifier can achieve a peak efficiency of 76%, and well above 60% over the envelope frequencies from 1MHz to 20MHz. By adding this push-pull amplifier, the three-band modulator can achieve a peak efficiency of 81% and an effective efficiency of 73% for 10MHz and 20MHz LTE signals with 30W output power. The linearity of the push-pull amplifier and the three-band modulator has been evaluated.

The realized Class-ABJ power amplifier delivers drain efficiency greater than 55% with output power and gain greater than 42.4-44.4 dBm and 10-11 dB respectively for the two frequency bands 2.05-2.22 GHz and 2.45-2.58 GHz at around 2-3 dB of compression level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6459243/","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308668","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dual-band Class-ABJ AlGaN/GaN high power amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-band Class-ABJ AlGaN/GaN high power amplifier","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044045S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423128","isNumber":"6459071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423128","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6459071","articleId":"6459243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6459244,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Institute for Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"38548658500"},{"name":"Ya-Ru Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Institute for Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Ru","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"38548455600"},{"name":"Chi-Cheng Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Institute for Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Cheng","lastName":"Tsai","id":"38547863900"},{"name":"Yi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Advanced Institute for Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407093700"},{"name":"Chia-Chan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Communications Engineering Center for Telecommunication Research, Advanced Institute for Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Chan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37276909700"},{"name":"Sheng-Fuh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Communications Engineering Center for Telecommunication Research, Advanced Institute for Manufacturing with High-tech Innovations, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Fuh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37539730600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-027-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2215-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-026-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6459244","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1379},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Butler matrix","Arrays","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Switches","Transmission line matrix methods","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","coplanar waveguides","matrix algebra","waveguide antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact two-dimensional phased antenna array","grounded coplanar-waveguides Butler matrices","2D 4\u00d74 multibeam phased antenna array","Butler matrix beamforming technique","4-way Butler matrices","stack controls","horizontal angle control","CPWG configuration","microstrip line-based Butler matrix","integrated array","frequency 2.45 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phased array","Beamforming","Butler matrix","Grounded coplanar-waveguide"]}],"abstract":"A 2.45 GHz two-dimensional (2-D) 4\u00d74 multi-beam phased array was designed, based on the Butler matrix beamforming technique.

Radiation quality factors of individual radiation modes differ significantly, as is typical for small antennas. For MIMO operation the bandwidth is limited by the mode with the highest radiation quality factor and is often insufficient to match the antenna in both Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL) portions of a band simultaneously. However, a trade-off solution where N orthogonal radiation modes are mapped to N separate external feed ports of which a first subset is assigned to the DL frequency band and used for DL reception and a second subset is assigned to the UL frequency band exists. The maximum attainable bandwidth of each radiation mode can thus be exploited. A systematic design procedure for Mode Matching Network (MMN) and Mode Decomposition Network (MDN) which supports this approach is shown. The MMN design is based on minimization of the total multi-port reflectance or minimization of a subset of modal reflectances over different frequency bands. This network matches radiation modes of the antenna. A subsequent MDN maps modes to separate external ports. The design of a MDN uses Givens rotations of the matrix containing in its columns the eigenvectors of the radiation matrix. Separation of the matching and decomposition functionality and the optimum sequence of MMN and MDN allows for low-loss realization of a DL-MIMO or UL-MIMO antenna system.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459278","publicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423128/6459071/06459278.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459071","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"N-port DL-MIMO antenna system realization using systematically designed Mode Matching and Mode Decomposition Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"N-port DL-MIMO antenna system realization using systematically designed Mode Matching and Mode Decomposition Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459278/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13308696","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459278/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"N-port DL-MIMO antenna system realization using systematically designed Mode Matching and Mode Decomposition Network","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039269S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423128","isNumber":"6459071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423128","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6459071","articleId":"6459278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459282,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Miguel Cruz","affiliation":["Departamento Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro Miguel","lastName":"Cruz","id":"37391871900"},{"name":"Nuno Borges Carvalho","affiliation":["Departamento Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno Borges","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"37264877100"},{"name":"Mikko E.

Conventional BB phase shifters use variable gain amplifiers (VGA), which have low linearity, and calibration is required for over 3-bit BB phase shifters. In this paper, we propose a novel BB phase shifter using fixed gain amplifiers (FGA) matrix with in/out-phase switches. Since FGA normally has higher linearity than VGA, it is possible to reduce overall power consumption to achieve same linearity. FGA has fixed reflection and transfer characteristic, so mismatch between phase shift states are reduced. By dividing phase shifter into smaller stages, the effects of process mismatches on very nearby transistors are small. So proposed structure has robustness against process mismatch. Fabricated 5-bit BB phase shifter using proposed method has a very low power consumption to achieve almost same linearity as other works and has a 3-dB bandwidth of 1.2 GHz, 1.5\u00b0 of rms phase error, lower than 0.2 dB of rms gain error without calibration. For ambient temperature from -20\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C, simulated rms phase error varied by only 0.2\u00b0, and did not vary with process mismatch.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shifters","Gain","Linearity","Transistors","Bandwidth","Phase measurement","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","field effect MIMIC","millimetre wave amplifiers","millimetre wave phase shifters","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS baseband phase shifter","fixed gain amplifier matrix","millimeter wave beamforming system","local oscillator frequency","low frequency baseband phase shifter","BB phase shifter","variable gain amplifiers","VGA","FGA matrix","in-out-phase switches","power consumption","phase shift states","RMS phase error","transistors","word length 5 bit","bandwidth 1.2 GHz","temperature -20 degC to 80 degC","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Baseband","Phase Shifter","No Calibration","Broadband Communication"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459303","publicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 42nd European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423128/6459071/06459303.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2012.6459303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Si-CMOS 5-bit baseband phase shifter using fixed gain amplifier matrix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Si-CMOS 5-bit baseband phase shifter using fixed gain amplifier matrix","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459303/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459303/","accessionNumber":"13308718","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Si-CMOS 5-bit baseband phase shifter using fixed gain amplifier matrix","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"1375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050644S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423128","isNumber":"6459071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423128","xplore-issue":"6459071","articleId":"6459303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6459311,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Nghiem Xuan","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centref, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anh Nghiem","lastName":"Xuan","id":"38547821300"},{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal CMOS Circuits, UMIC Research Centref, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Negra","id":"37275858200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-027-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2215-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-026-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6459311","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Frequency measurement","Loss measurement","Radio frequency","Power transmission lines","FETs","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent multiband biasing network design","multiband RF power amplifiers","transmission line","high impedance quaterwave open stubs","QWOS","triband BN","active devices","FET","class-AB triband power amplifier","power added efficiency","PAE","frequency 1.49 GHz","frequency 2.15 GHz","frequency 2.65 GHz","power 10 W"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new technique for designing concurrent multiband biasing networks for multiband RF power amplifiers is presented.

The main idea is based upon the physical nature that subcarriers carrying pilots or payload data have different first-order and second-order statistical properties. These differences vanish when the spectrum of interest is unoccupied. Therefore, the decision of spectrum availability can be formed based upon these differences, which can be explored through employment of frequency-domain differential operations. Thanks to the differential operations, the proposed technique has less sensitivity of the noise power uncertainty problem caused by imperfect hardware. Performance of the proposed technique is analytically formulated in terms of probability of false alarm (PFA) and probability of detection (PD). Computer simulations are carried out to elaborate the analytical results. It is shown that the second-order statistics based proposed technique outperforms the conventional pilot-assisted technique up to 7 dB. Moreover, it is shown that the first-order statistics based proposed technique outperforms the second-order statistics based proposed technique for small normalized Doppler shifts (\u2264 0.013). However, the second-order statistics based proposed technique offers better performance for larger normalized Doppler shifts.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6514800/06459479.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020813.120323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Pilot-Assisted Spectrum Sensing for OFDM Systems by Exploiting Statistical Difference Between Subcarriers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459479/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Pilot-Assisted Spectrum Sensing for OFDM Systems by Exploiting Statistical Difference Between Subcarriers","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487676","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459479/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Pilot-Assisted Spectrum Sensing for OFDM Systems by Exploiting Statistical Difference Between Subcarriers","sourcePdf":"1264-tc1304-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106588S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6459479","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459484,"authors":[{"name":"Xianfu Lei","affiliation":["Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China","Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xianfu","lastName":"Lei","id":"37315379200"},{"name":"Lisheng Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China","Shantou University, Shantou, China"],"firstName":"Lisheng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37401747600"},{"name":"Diomidis S.

The algorithm computes maximum-flow routings for all smooth unicast traffic demands within the Capacity Region of a network subject to routing cost constraints. The edge cost can be a distance, reliability, congestion or an energy metric. It is shown that every network has a finite Bandwidth-Cost capacity. The Bandwidth-Distance and the Bandwidth-Energy capacities are explored. The routing algorithm requires the formulation of two Linear Programs (LPs). The first LP finds a multicommodity Maximum-Flow, when the flows are constrained to a sub-graph of the network to enforce cost constraints. The second LP minimizes the routing cost, given that the maximum-flow is fixed. A related Constrained Multicast-Max-Flow-Min-Cost algorithm is also presented, to maximize the throughput of a multicast tree using network coding, subject to routing cost constraints. These algorithms have polynomial-time solutions, whereas traditional multipath routing algorithms can be NP-Hard. The addition of routing cost constraints can significantly reduce the size of the LPs, resulting in faster solutions, with lower edge utilizations and with higher energy efficiencies. The application of these algorithms to route aggregated video streams from cloud data centers in a Future-Internet network, with improved throughput, energy-efficiency and QoS guarantees is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6459492/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13487677","isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Max-Flow Min-Cost Routing in a Future-Internet with Improved QoS Guarantees","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Max-Flow Min-Cost Routing in a Future-Internet with Improved QoS Guarantees","sourcePdf":"1485-tc1304-ted.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103378S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6514800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6514800","articleId":"6459492","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459495,"authors":[{"name":"King-wa Fu","affiliation":["Journalism and Media Studies Center, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["King-wa Fu is an assistant professor at the Journalism and Media Studies Center, University of Hong Kong.

To better control for alternative explanations for censorship decisions attributable to an individual's characteristics and choices, they used a matched case-control study design to determine a list of Chinese terms that discriminate censored and uncensored posts written by the same microbloggers. This list includes homophones and puns created by Chinese microbloggers to circumvent the censors successfully. The study's design also made it possible to evaluate the real-name registration system's impact on microbloggers' posting activities. Findings suggest that the new policy might have stopped some microbloggers from writing about social and political subjects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2013","volume":"17","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13475658","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","publicationDate":"May-June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459495/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Assessing Censorship on Microblogs in China: Discriminatory Keyword Analysis and the Real-Name Registration Policy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing Censorship on Microblogs in China: Discriminatory Keyword Analysis and the Real-Name Registration Policy","sourcePdf":"mic2013030042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06459S","chronDate":"May-June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4236","isNumber":"6509859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4236","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6509859","articleId":"6459495","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6459498,"authors":[{"name":"David Liau","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Liau","id":"38579623700"},{"name":"Kwang-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kwang-Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278248500"},{"name":"Shin-Ming Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shin-Ming","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37402282300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6459498","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Predator prey systems","Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Cognitive radio","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","ecology","predator-prey systems","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predator-prey model","spectrum utilization enhancement","opportunistic transmission","link level","time dynamics","primary system users","secondary cognitive radio users","predators species model","communication resources","population dynamics","spectrum-sharing ecosystem","transient behavior","CR system","heterogeneous users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","ecology","predator-prey model","spectrum sharing","Lotka-Volterra model","biological ecosystem"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Predator-Prey Model for Dynamics of Cognitive Radios","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.020513.122120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6481524","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6481524/06459498.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.020513.122120","startPage":"467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459498","abstract":"Cognitive radio technology is well known to enhance spectrum utilization via opportunistic transmission at link level.

Unlike existing methods that focus on minimizing or forcing the sidelobes to zero, the proposed precoder is designed with the goal of controlling the out-of-band emissions beneath a particular power level without impacting the bit error rate (BER) performance. A small distortion is added to the information symbols forcing the emitted spectrum under a prescribed radio frequency mask. Obtained results show that the BER performance of the proposed precoder is similar to that of uncoded OFDM under relaxed masks. Moreover, the effect of the proposed precoder on edge subcarriers is investigated. Error vector magnitude (EVM) per subcarrier shows the designed precoder introduces more distortion on edge subcarriers. Consequently, the proposed precoder when combined with adaptive modulation provides further improvement in BER performance under strict masks.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.020513.122495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6481524/06459499.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.020513.122495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6481524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mask Compliant Precoder for OFDM Spectrum Shaping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459499/","displayDocTitle":"Mask Compliant Precoder for OFDM Spectrum Shaping","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13401551","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459499/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mask Compliant Precoder for OFDM Spectrum Shaping","sourcePdf":"447-cl1303-tom.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054561S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6481524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6481524","articleId":"6459499","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459503,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Gholami","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Gholami","id":"37866779800"},{"name":"Mehdi Samadieh","affiliation":["Isfahan Mathematics House, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Samadieh","id":"38667234100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6459503","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Encoding","Decoding","Complexity theory","Simulation","Bit error rate","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","cyclic codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["irregular girth-8 cycle codes","regular girth-8 cycle codes","high code rates","parity-check matrices","quasicyclic cycle codes","QC cycle codes","cylinder-type cycle codes","girth-24 geometric-type cycle codes","nonbinary constructed cycle code design","binary constructed cycle code design","repeat accumulate codes","progressive edge growth codes","random-like LDPC codes","PEG codes","RA codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","Tanner graph","girth"]}],"abstract":"-In this paper, some regular and irregular girth-8 cycle codes with arbitrarily high code rates are presented which have minimum lengths among all girth-8 cycle codes having parity-check matrices of the same row regularity.

A detailed derivation of this model is given for a generalized system by means of a perturbation analysis of the Manakov equation with attenuation, gain, and third order dispersion included. As in the case with previous studies, three simplifying assumptions are necessary. These are that (i) the nonlinearity is weak, (ii) the input signal is of a given specific form, and (iii) the signal-noise interaction can be neglected. Under these assumptions, the result is found exactly. We also discuss the accuracy of the analytical result and show that third order dispersion has a small impact in practice.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2246543","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6461949/06459512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2246543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461949","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perturbation Analysis of Nonlinear Propagation in a Strongly Dispersive Optical Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Perturbation Analysis of Nonlinear Propagation in a Strongly Dispersive Optical Communication System","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13551621","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459512/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perturbation Analysis of Nonlinear Propagation in a Strongly Dispersive Optical Communication System","sourcePdf":"jlt-johannisson-2246543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100007S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6461949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6461949","articleId":"6459512","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459513,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander N.

Unlike prior integrated photonic devices, the DREAM exhibits properties of stable binary decision making, outputting a constant \u201cone\u201d power value for signals above a certain power level and \u201czero\u201d for signals of lower powers. This thresholding shape arises from the interference of complementary nonlinear effects of two microring resonators (MRR), one in each arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The proposed device performs several orders of magnitude better in size, decision latency, energy efficiency, and stability compared to fiber-based methods of optical thresholding. It is best suited for application in densely integrated systems where rapid conversion between analog and digital signal domains is ubiquitous, such as hybrid analog-digital and neuromorphic processing architectures. We derive analytical steady-state solutions to the nonlinear MRR, which enable design simulation, optimization, and automation of a continuous signal thresholder about three orders of magnitude faster than with numerical simulation. Additional numerical simulations indicate the possibility of a 50 GHz pulse thresholder with a 380 pJ switching threshold in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. The proposed circuit design techniques are potentially applicable to a wide range of materials, waveguide platforms, and resonator types, but for concreteness, we limit the focus of this paper to MRRs in SOI.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2246544","startPage":"1263","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6461949/06459513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2246544","endPage":"1272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The DREAM: An Integrated Photonic Thresholder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"The DREAM: An Integrated Photonic Thresholder","volume":"31","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6459513/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13551622","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"April15, 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The DREAM: An Integrated Photonic Thresholder","sourcePdf":"jlt-tait-2246544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082178S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6461949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6461949","articleId":"6459513","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459514,"authors":[{"name":"Ciaran S.

In this paper, the Sinclair matrix has been projected onto the circular polarization basis and is decomposed into five parameters that are invariant to the relative phase \u03a6, the Faraday rotation \u03a9, and the target orientation \u03a8 without any information loss. The physical interpretation of these parameters, useful for target classification studies, is found in the wave-particle nature of radar scattering phenomenon given the circular polarization of elemental packets of energy. The proposed deterministic target decomposition is based on the left-orthogonal special unitary SU(2) basis, decomposing the signal backscattered by point targets, represented by the target vector, via six special unitary SU(4) rotation matrices, and by providing full resolution and lossless analysis. Comparisons between the proposed deterministic target decomposition and the Cameron, Kennaugh, Krogager, and Touzi decompositions are also pointed out. Generally, the proposed decomposition provides simpler interpretation, faster parameter extraction, and better generalization properties for the analysis of nonreciprocal or random targets. Several polarimetric SAR/ISAR data sets of UWB data, airborne fully polarimetric EMISAR data, and spaceborne RADARSAT2 are used for illustrating the effectiveness and the usefulness of this decomposition for the classification of point targets. Results are very promising for application use in the next generation of high-resolution spaceborne and airborne Pol-SAR and Pol-ISAR systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2227894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461951","startPage":"798","endPage":"830","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

Especially detection of cars in dense urban areas is of interest due to the high traffic volume and the limited space. In city areas many car-like objects (e.g., dormers) appear which might lead to confusion. Additionally, the inaccuracy of road databases supporting the extraction process has to be handled in a proper way. This paper describes an integrated real-time processing chain which utilizes multiple occurrence of objects in images. At least two subsequent images, data of exterior orientation, a global DEM, and a road database are used as input data. The segments of the road database are projected in the non-geocoded image using the corresponding height information from the global DEM. From amply masked road areas in both images a disparity map is calculated. This map is used to exclude elevated objects above a certain height (e.g., buildings and vegetation). Additionally, homogeneous areas are excluded by a fast region growing algorithm. Remaining parts of one input image are classified based on the `Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG)' features. The implemented approach has been verified using image sections from two different flights and manually extracted ground truth data from the inner city of Munich. The evaluation shows a quality of up to 70 percent.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2242846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6562919/06459549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2242846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6562919","startPage":"2327","endPage":"2337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airborne Vehicle Detection in Dense Urban Areas Using HoG Features and Disparity Maps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Airborne Vehicle Detection in Dense Urban Areas Using HoG Features and Disparity Maps","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13968966","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459549/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Airborne Vehicle Detection in Dense Urban Areas Using HoG Features and Disparity Maps","sourcePdf":"jstars-turmer-2242846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090221S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6562919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6562919","articleId":"6459549","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459550,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wu","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Group State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6516028/6459550/6459550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Wu received the B.S. degree in surveying and mapping engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2010.

Most traditional change detection methods deal with single-band or multispectral remote sensing images. Hyperspectral remote sensing images offer more detailed information on spectral changes so as to present promising change detection performance. The challenge is how to take advantage of the spectral information at such a high dimension. In this paper, we propose a subspace-based change detection (SCD) method for hyperspectral images. Instead of dealing with band-wise changes, the proposed method measures spectral changes. SCD regards the observed pixel in the image of Time 2 as target and constructs the background subspace using the corresponding pixel in the image of Time 1, and additional information. In this paper, two types of additional information, i.e., spatial information in the neighborhood of the corresponding pixel in Time 1, and the spectral information of undesired land-cover types, are used to construct the background subspace for special applications. The subspace distance is calculated to determine whether the target is anomalous with respect to the background subspace. The anomalous pixels are considered as changes. Here, orthogonal subspace projection is employed to calculate the subspace distance, which makes full use of the advantage of the abundant spectral information in hyperspectral imagery, and is also easy to apply. The experimental results using Hyperion data and HJ-1A HSI data indicate that SCD gives more accurate detection results, with a lower false alarm rate, compared with other state-of-the-art methods. SCD with additional information also gives satisfactory results in the experiments, reducing the false alarms caused by misregistration and suppressing the change of undesired land-cover types.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2241396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6516028/06459550.pdf","startPage":"815","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2241396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Subspace-Based Change Detection Method for Hyperspectral Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459550/","displayDocTitle":"A Subspace-Based Change Detection Method for Hyperspectral Images","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13499705","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459550/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Subspace-Based Change Detection Method for Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhang-2241396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113482S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6516028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6516028","articleId":"6459550","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6459552,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Zu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6468162/6459552/6459552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Zu Lin (S'06\u2013M'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

The flash ADC controls the thermometer coarse capacitors of the DAC and the SAR ADC controls the binary fine ones. Both theoretical analysis and behavioral simulations show that the differential non-linearity (DNL) of a SAR ADC with a segmented DAC is better than that of a binary ADC. The merged switching of the coarse capacitors significantly enhances overall operation speed. At 150 MS/s, the ADC consumes 1.53 mW from a 1.2-V supply. The effective number of bits (ENOB) is 8.69 bits and the effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) is 100 MHz. With a 1.3-V supply voltage, the sampling rate is 200 MS/s with 2.2-mW power consumption.

In order to provide sufficient memory bandwidth without the need for using registers, a FIFO-based check-mode memory, which dominates the decoder area, is used. Since two compensation factors, rather than a single factor, are dynamically used in the offset Min-Sum algorithm, the number of quantization bits, and, hence, the memory size, can be reduced without degradation in error performance. In order to further reduce the memory size, artificial minimum values, which do not need to be stored in memory, are used. We also propose an algorithm that can be used to partition variable nodes such that the hardware cost can be minimized. Using the proposed techniques, a multi-standard decoder that supports the LDPC codes specified in the ITU G.hn, IEEE 802.11n, and IEEE 802.16e standards was designed and implemented using a 90-nm CMOS process.

In this paper, a differential hybrid transformer duplexer that covers 3GPP bands I, II, III, and IX between 1.7 and 2.2 GHz is introduced. It achieves a differential to differential isolation of 60 dB in the transmit (TX) band and 40 dB in the receive (RX) band, and a differential to common-mode isolation of 60 dB in both bands. The duplexer with a cascaded low-noise amplifier (LNA) achieves a noise figure of 5.6 dB in the RX path and an insertion loss of 3.7 dB in the TX path. The duplexer and LNA are implemented in a 90-nm CMOS process, consume 20 mA, and occupy an active area of 0.6 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2243748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6472304/06459555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2243748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472304","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Transformer-Based Tunable Differential Duplexer in a 90-nm CMOS Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Transformer-Based Tunable Differential Duplexer in a 90-nm CMOS Process","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355109","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459555/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Transformer-Based Tunable Differential Duplexer in a 90-nm CMOS Process","sourcePdf":"tmtt-abdelhalem-2243748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070757S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6472304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6472304","articleId":"6459555","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459560,"authors":[{"name":"Jingfang Huang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, North Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6471805/6459560/6459560-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingfang Huang received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

Recently, wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) have shown its advantages for smart grid by providing rich surveillance information for grid failure detection and recovery, energy source monitoring, asset management, security, etc. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) networks have been identified as a key wireless technology to reduce the communication interferences and improve the bandwidth efficiency for smart grid communication. There is an essential need to use the CR communication platform to support large-size and time-sensitive multimedia delivery for future smart grid system. In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous characteristics of smart grid traffic including multimedia and propose a priority-based traffic scheduling approach for CR communication infrastructure based smart grid system according to the various traffic types of smart grid such as control commands, multimedia sensing data and meter readings. Specifically, we develop CR channel allocation and traffic scheduling schemes taking into consideration of channel switch and spectrum sensing errors, and solve a system utility optimization problem for smart grid communication system. Our solutions are demonstrated through both analyzes and simulations.

The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by illustrative examples.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2013.2240451","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6670128/06459570.pdf","startPage":"2122","endPage":"2134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2013.2240451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis of Time-Delay Neural Networks Subject to Stochastic Perturbations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis of Time-Delay Neural Networks Subject to Stochastic Perturbations","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13914868","pubMedId":"23757521","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459570/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis of Time-Delay Neural Networks Subject to Stochastic Perturbations","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zheng-2240451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105284S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6670128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6670128","articleId":"6459570","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6459584,"authors":[{"name":"Chiara Pratola","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering and Computer Science Engineering, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6484138/6459584/6459584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chiara Pratola (S'10) received the Laurea (B.S., summa cum laude) and Laurea Specialistica (M.S.; summa cum laude, right to be published) degrees in environmental engineering in 2005 and 2008, respectively, from Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in geoinformation in the Earth Observation Laboratory (EOLab).","Since 2008, she has been with the EOLab, where she worked on oil spill and ship detection in ERS and Environmental Satellite images.

This approach has only recently gained increasing interest. The quality of reconstruction methods based on an analysis model severely depends on the right choice of the suitable operator. In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning an analysis operator from training images. Our method is based on \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">lp</i>\n-norm minimization on the set of full rank matrices with normalized columns. We carefully introduce the employed conjugate gradient method on manifolds, and explain the underlying geometry of the constraints. Moreover, we compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods for image denoising, inpainting, and single image super-resolution. Our numerical results show competitive performance of our general approach in all presented applications compared to the specialized state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2246175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6490370/06459595.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2246175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6490370","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis Operator Learning and its Application to Image Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis Operator Learning and its Application to Image Reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13412759","pubMedId":"23412611","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459595/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis Operator Learning and its Application to Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tip-hawe-2246175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094314S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6490370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6490370","articleId":"6459595","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459603,"authors":[{"name":"Xinxing Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6477170/6459603/6459603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinxing Xu received the B.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2009.

However, the traditional \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\nMKL method often achieves worse results than the simplest method using the average of base kernels (i.e., average kernel) in some practical applications. In order to improve the effectiveness of MKL, this paper presents a novel soft margin perspective for MKL. Specifically, we introduce an additional slack variable called kernel slack variable to each quadratic constraint of MKL, which corresponds to one support vector machine model using a single base kernel. We first show that \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\nMKL can be deemed as hard margin MKL, and then we propose a novel soft margin framework for MKL. Three commonly used loss functions, including the hinge loss, the square hinge loss, and the square loss, can be readily incorporated into this framework, leading to the new soft margin MKL objective functions. Many existing MKL methods can be shown as special cases under our soft margin framework. For example, the hinge loss soft margin MKL leads to a new box constraint for kernel combination coefficients. Using different hyper-parameter values for this formulation, we can inherently bridge the method using average kernel, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\nMKL, and the hinge loss soft margin MKL. The square hinge loss soft margin MKL unifies the family of elastic net constraint/regularizer based approaches; and the square loss soft margin MKL incorporates \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nMKL naturally. Moreover, we also develop efficient algorithms for solving both the hinge loss and square hinge loss soft margin MKL. Comprehensive experimental studies for various MKL algorithms on several benchmark data sets and two real world applications, including video action recognition and event recognition demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can efficiently achieve an effective yet sparse solution for MKL.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6477170/06459603.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Margin Multiple Kernel Learning","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2237183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2237183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Soft Margin Multiple Kernel Learning","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13382489","pubMedId":"24808425","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6459603/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Margin Multiple Kernel Learning","sourcePdf":"tnnls-xu-2237183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106591S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6477170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6477170","articleId":"6459603","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459607,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya A.

The deformation of flexible wings can be controlled by actuators that are located at the root or the tip of the wing. The problem of designing a tracking controller for wing twist is addressed using a combination of PDE backstepping for feedback stabilization and feed-forward trajectory planning. We also design an adaptive tracking controller for wing tip actuators. For wing bending, we present a novel control scheme that is based on a two-stage perturbation observer. A trajectory planning-based feed-forward tracker is designed using only one component of the observer whose dynamics are homogeneous and amenable to trajectory planning. The two components, put together, estimate the external forces and unmodeled system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers for twist and bending is demonstrated by simulations.

In this paper, an analysis on the delay of the dynamic comparators will be presented and analytical expressions are derived. From the analytical expressions, designers can obtain an intuition about the main contributors to the comparator delay and fully explore the tradeoffs in dynamic comparator design. Based on the presented analysis, a new dynamic comparator is proposed, where the circuit of a conventional double-tail comparator is modified for low-power and fast operation even in small supply voltages. Without complicating the design and by adding few transistors, the positive feedback during the regeneration is strengthened, which results in remarkably reduced delay time. Post-layout simulation results in a 0.18- \u03bcm CMOS technology confirm the analysis results. It is shown that in the proposed dynamic comparator both the power consumption and delay time are significantly reduced. The maximum clock frequency of the proposed comparator can be increased to 2.5 and 1.1 GHz at supply voltages of 1.2 and 0.6 V, while consuming 1.4 mW and 153 \u03bcW, respectively. The standard deviation of the input-referred offset is 7.8 mV at 1.2 V supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","volume":"22","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14056664","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6459609/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of a Low-Voltage Low-Power Double-Tail Comparator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of a Low-Voltage Low-Power Double-Tail Comparator","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-babayanmashhadi-2241799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069519S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6716075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"6716075","articleId":"6459609","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6459610,"authors":[{"name":"Keheng Huang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Keheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"38063881500"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277445400"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6459610","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":861},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Circuit faults","Field programmable gate arrays","Measurement","Wires","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability","integrated logic circuits","nanoelectronics","network routing","probability","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-oriented placement","routing algorithm","SRAM-based FPGAs","nanometer scale","fault occurrence probability","soft error mitigation","node error rate","error propagation probability","cube-based analysis algorithm","system-level robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cube-based analysis","failure rate","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","mean time between failures (MTBFs)","placement and routing","soft error mitigation"]}],"abstract":"As the feature size shrinks to the nanometer scale, SRAM-based FPGAs will become increasingly vulnerable to soft errors. Existing reliability-oriented placement and routing approaches primarily focus on reducing the fault occurrence probability (node error rate) of soft errors. However, our analysis shows that, besides the fault occurrence probability, the propagation probability (error propagation probability) plays an important role and should be taken into consideration. In this paper, we first propose a cube-based analysis algorithm to efficiently and accurately estimate the error propagation probability. Based on such a model, we propose a novel reliability-oriented placement and routing algorithm that combines both the fault occurrence probability and the error propagation probability together to enhance system-level robustness against soft errors. Experimental results show that, compared with the baseline versatile place and route technique, the proposed scheme can reduce the failure rate by 20.73%, and increase the mean time between failures by 39.44%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-Oriented Placement and Routing Algorithm for SRAM-Based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2239318","startPage":"256","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2239318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6716075/06459610.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Oriented Placement and Routing Algorithm for SRAM-Based FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14056659","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Oriented Placement and Routing Algorithm for SRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-huang-2239318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071348S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"6716075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","articleId":"6459610","onlineDate":"11 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6459637,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago M.F.

In a multihop CR ad hoc network, aggregating knowledge about the external environment is a task which the CR nodes must perform based on their individual and collective capacity. In this paper, we introduce Distributed Resource Map (DRM), a framework for cooperation and knowledge aggregation in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. The DRM is a database-driven knowledge base aimed at exploiting distributed sensing performed by heterogeneous CR nodes and inter-nodes cooperation to maintain a network-wide support architecture. The awareness obtained through DRM architecture is used to drive the learning and decision making functions of a Cognitive Engine (CE). We present the core concepts, the architectural components, underlying knowledge aggregation functions, and a summary of the validation and realization effort. The paper concludes with a planned experimental work for DRM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459662/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13324335","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459662/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Resource Map: A database-driven network support architecture for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Resource Map: A database-driven network support architecture for Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p188khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081887S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459663,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Sohail","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sohail","id":"37924662100"},{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Barry G.

The capacity of the Secondary User (SU) is maximized while keeping the interference introduced to the Primary User (PU) band remains within tolerable range. However the drawback of such an approach is that channel capacity increases with increasing Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which is not applicable to a practical scenario. Therefore, we propose an optimal power loading scheme under the Finite Symbol Alphabet (FSA) constraint, (i.e., QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM, etc.) to achieve realistic system performance especially under the high SNR region. Subsequently, Mutual Information (MI) is derived and compared against channel capacity which reveals that in the low SNR region, they are closely related. Conversely, MI saturates in the high SNR region which indicates maximum achievable data rates for practical systems. We further evaluate channel capacity and MI by varying the interference threshold and our observation is that the saturation value of the achievable SU data rate indicated by MI changes accordingly, but total achievable data rate remains constant. On the other hand, capacity increases with increasing interference threshold.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459663","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459663.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation scheme under FSA constraint for OFDM based cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459663/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation scheme under FSA constraint for OFDM based cognitive radio systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459663/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation scheme under FSA constraint for OFDM based cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p195sohail.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054051S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6459666,"authors":[{"name":"Cengiz Bektas","affiliation":["Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cengiz","lastName":"Bektas","id":"38547824800"},{"name":"Aydin Akan","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Aydin","lastName":"Akan","id":"37327893100"},{"name":"Niyazi Odabasioglu","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Niyazi","lastName":"Odabasioglu","id":"37550680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459666","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Wavelet coefficients","Channel models","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","phase shift keying","signal detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy based spectrum sensing","wavelet transform","fading channels","energy level","cognitive radio","primary user signal","wavelet coefficients","communication channel noise energy","wavelet based algorithm","binary phase shift keying modulated signals"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a spectrum sensing algorithm based on energy level at different frequency bands using wavelet transform for Cognitive Radio (CR) applications.

An important and favorable characteristic of DVB-T for this application is its being working in a Single Frequency Network (SFN), so that multiple transmitters can be used simultaneously to detect the targets. In addition, using multiple antennas at the receiver side leads to the well known configuration known as MIMO. However, one of the obstacles, arisen in such configurations, is the receive antennas' placement in proper positions so that the detection performance is improved.

blind-oversampling Clock and Data Recovery circuits, which determine the center of the data eye by observing the positions of edges in a data stream. The first model describes the traditional averaged phase picking method based on counting the edges in several domains, which divide the signal period. The second model was developed for a newly proposed CDR circuit, which selects the optimum sampling phase upon the occurrence of several consecutive edges in one sampling domain. Its simulation model is based on the periodic Markov chain representation of the domain-selection process. The averaged Bit-Error Rate can be simply computed from the steady-state of the chain. The computational complexity of statistical models is determined by the added jitter properties rather than by the actual level of bit-error rate. The models include random jitter, sinusoidal jitter, and frequency offset of transmit and receive clocks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459713","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459713.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"483","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis of blind-oversampling CDR circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis of blind-oversampling CDR circuits","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6459713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324386","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459713/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis of blind-oversampling CDR circuits","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p479kolka.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042599S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6459717,"authors":[{"name":"Chigozirim Oriaku","affiliation":["Department of Applied Computing, University of Buckingham, UK"],"firstName":"Chigozirim","lastName":"Oriaku","id":"38541918700"},{"name":"Nahla Alwan","affiliation":["Department of Applied Computing, University of Buckingham, UK"],"firstName":"Nahla","lastName":"Alwan","id":"38547539700"},{"name":"Ihsan Alshahib Lami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Computing, University of Buckingham, UK"],"firstName":"Ihsan Alshahib","lastName":"Lami","id":"38540934700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459717","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":943},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Mobile communication","Androids","Humanoid robots","Cloud computing","Security","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","industrial property","mobile computing","operating systems (computers)","security of data","smart phones","software architecture","software reliability","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile operating systems","mobile cloud computing services","MCCS","mobile devices","smartphones","tablets","pervasive computing","mobile technology","Android","IOS","Windows Mobile","mobile virtualisation","security needs","license IP separation enhancement","license IP portability enhancement","license IP reliability enhancement","license IP security enhancement","hardware consolidation","CCS platform","MOS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing services","Mobile cloud computing services","Mobile operating systems","Pervasive computing","Android"]}],"abstract":"$5.2 billion is forecasted as the market size of cloud computing services (CCS) on mobile devices such as Smartphones and Tablets. Mobile cloud computing services (MCCS) has incited an innovative surge of advancement in the fast emerging pervasive computing. Although a number of studies have been carried out in the area of mobile technology, the subject of the readiness of the mobile operating systems, such as Android, IOS and Windows Mobile in MCCS is immensely being unexplored. Challenges and architecture for a suitable MCCS have been defined in this paper. It goes to develop criteria to measure the various Mobile Operating System (MOS) offerings to identify the additional features that should be implemented on MOS to enable and/or enhance that efficient MCCS. This paper also analyses the readiness of MOS to meet the challenges of offering these MCCSs. An in-depth study of the current requirements and challenges are identified, hence criteria is formed that is used to compare these current Smartphone MOS. This paper concludes that mobile virtualisation and security needs to be explored by MOS providers in order to enhance license IP separation, portability, reliability, security, and the consolidation of hardware amongst Smartphones, mobile network operators and MCCS providers. This will aid widening the scope for defining Smartphones as the CCS platform.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459717","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459717.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The readiness of mobile operating systems for cloud computing services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459717/","displayDocTitle":"The readiness of mobile operating systems for cloud computing services","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324390","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459717/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The readiness of mobile operating systems for cloud computing services","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p49oriaku.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0529S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6459720,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The apparent options of optical amplification in wavelength division multiplexing systems include the distributed Raman amplifiers, erbium doped fiber amplifiers, and semiconductor optical amplifiers. In our case distributed Raman amplifier is located at the mid-span reach extender which allows for remote amplification in passive network nodes by distributing a Raman pump together with the data signals. In the case of only distributed Raman amplifier in long reach optical access system wavelength division multiplexing exploitation is inefficient. Combining the advantages of different amplifiers allows fast gain dynamics, simultaneous large bandwidth amplification, and the ability to provide gain at any wavelength.

Different traffic types transmitted over the network suggest a dynamic resource allocation in order to provide a better quality of service (QoS). There are radio resource management modules, called schedulers, which are engaged in resource planning and access priority assignment depending on the types of traffic with the specified requirements for QoS. Schedulers are developed based on algorithms derived from solving various radio resources optimization problems. Cross-layer optimization problems such as the problem of minimizing the transmission power or the problem of maximizing the transmission rate [1], in fact involve the optimization of a utility function, that describe a certain level of user satisfaction for a particular resources allocation scheme under certain restrictions. In this paper we study two cross-layer optimization algorithms that are intended to maximize the utility function under different conditions - dynamic subcarrier assignment (DSA) algorithm and adaptive power allocation (APA) algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459745","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","startPage":"63","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility function maximization problems for two cross-layer optimization algorithms in OFDM wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Utility function maximization problems for two cross-layer optimization algorithms in OFDM wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459745/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324418","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459745/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility function maximization problems for two cross-layer optimization algorithms in OFDM wireless networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p63samuylov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039302S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":6459763,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Castro","affiliation":["Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Castro","id":"38323031300"},{"name":"Luis Velasco","affiliation":["Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Velasco","id":"37402398600"},{"name":"Marc Ruiz","affiliation":["Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Ruiz","id":"37587367100"},{"name":"Jaume Comellas","affiliation":["Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jaume","lastName":"Comellas","id":"37272733800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459763","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"abstract":"The new flexgrid technology, in opposition to the fixed grid one traditionally used in wavelength switched optical networks (WSON), allows allocating the spectral bandwidth needed to convey heterogeneous client demand bitrates in a flexible manner so that the optical spectrum can be managed much more efficiently. In this paper we propose a new recovery scheme, called single-path provisioning multi-path recovery (SPP-MPR), specifically designed for flexgrid-based optical networks. It provisions single-paths to serve the bitrate requested by client demands and combines protection and restoration schemes to jointly recover, in part or totally, that bitrate in case of failure. We define the bitrate squeezed recovery optimization (BRASERO) problem to maximize the bitrate which is recovered in case of failure of any single fiber link. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is provided. Exhaustive numerical experiments carried out over two network topologies and realistic traffic scenarios show that the efficiency of the proposed SPP-MPR scheme approaches that of restoration mechanisms while providing recovery times as short as protection schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control

Social networks can be used for storing and sharing links to resources of interest for the humanrobot and robot-robot interactions. A Stinger robot-based prototype was built to demonstrate the presented functionalities. The prototype shows that this model is not only flexible, but also practical.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459769","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459769.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Social Internet of Things and the RFID-based robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Social Internet of Things and the RFID-based robots","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13342097","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459769/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459769/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Social Internet of Things and the RFID-based robots","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p77turcu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039336S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459785,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Khasawneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Khasawneh","id":"38474128500"},{"name":"Anjali Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Anjali","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273300400"},{"name":"Nishith Goel","affiliation":["Cistel Technology, Inc., Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Nishith","lastName":"Goel","id":"37338474800"},{"name":"Marzia Zaman","affiliation":["Cistel Technology, Inc., Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Marzia","lastName":"Zaman","id":"37549617700"},{"name":"Saed Alrabaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Saed","lastName":"Alrabaee","id":"38473965000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459785","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459785","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Pricing","Mathematical model","Interference","Sensors","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","pricing","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["price setting approach","power trading","cognitive radio network technology","frequency spectrum bands","primary users","secondary users","SU","PU","QoS","transmission power","power pricing model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum trading","cognitive radio","pricing model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459785","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459785.pdf","startPage":"878","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A price setting approach to power trading in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio technology has been proposed to improve the spectrum utilization by sharing the frequency spectrum bands between the licensed and unlicensed users which are called primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) respectively. The main objective of the SUs is to achieve their QoS by exploiting the unused spectrum while the PUs aim to get high profit by leasing their unused spectrum. Pricing and transmission power are two key issues of interest to PUs and SUs as well. In this paper, we propose a power pricing model wherein the PUs attain some revenue by renting their unused frequency to SUs that use suitable power levels to transmit which do not interfere with other users in the network. In our proposed model the SUs coexist with PUs in the same network where they can transmit over the same channel simultaneously. Performance evaluation of the proposed model demonstrates that the scheme helps in using the frequency spectrum more efficiently and increasing the gained profit of the PUs in comparison with the other existing models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459785/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13324457","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459785/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A price setting approach to power trading in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A price setting approach to power trading in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p878khasawneh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066872S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6459790,"authors":[{"name":"Saed Alrabaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Saed","lastName":"Alrabaee","id":"38473965000"},{"name":"Anjali Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Anjali","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273300400"},{"name":"Nishith Goel","affiliation":["Cistel Technology, Inc., Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Nishith","lastName":"Goel","id":"37338474800"},{"name":"Marzia Zaman","affiliation":["Cistel Technology, Inc., Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Marzia","lastName":"Zaman","id":"37549617700"},{"name":"Mahmoud Khasawneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Khasawneh","id":"38474128500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459790","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Games","Mathematical model","Game theory","Cognitive radio","Equations","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","spectrum management","cognitive radio network","spectrum trading","spectrum competition","QoS","primary user","secondary user","Bertrand game","Nash equilibrium","Stackelberg game"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Competition Factor","Spectrum Management","Utility Function","Nash Equilibrium","Spectrum trading"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose cognitive radio network models for providing spectrum management which includes spectrum trading and spectrum competition. The models described are with and without using the concepts of game theory. For both the models, the spectrum trading that occurs between the primary user and the secondary user is considered first, and then the spectrum competition among the primary users is considered. Our model includes multiple levels of QoS for different secondary users. In the first phase, the secondary user selects the spectrum by observing the changes in the price and the level of QoS offered by different primary users. In the second phase, the primary user controls its strategy in renting the spectrum to secondary users to achieve the highest utility. To model the dynamic behavior of spectrum competition among primary users, a Bertrand game is formulated where the Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution. Moreover, to model the spectrum trading between the primary user and the secondary user, a Stackelberg game is formulated where the Nash equilibrium is again considered as the solution. Basically the solution is in terms of the size of offered spectrum to the secondary users and the offered spectrum price.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459790","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459790.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459790","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","startPage":"906","endPage":"913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game theoretic approach to spectrum management in cognitive radio network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A game theoretic approach to spectrum management in cognitive radio network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459790/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459790/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324462","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game theoretic approach to spectrum management in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p906alrabaee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086878S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459791,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey Khoryaev","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Khoryaev","id":"37396105200"},{"name":"Andrey Chervyakov","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Chervyakov","id":"37993919900"},{"name":"Mikhail Shilov","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Shilov","id":"38184707100"},{"name":"Sergey Panteleev","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Panteleev","id":"38547963800"},{"name":"Artyom Lomayev","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Artyom","lastName":"Lomayev","id":"37396101000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459791","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":986},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Loading","Geometry","Base stations","Adaptation models","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","picocellular radio","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDD uplink-downlink configurations","outdoor picocell LTE networks","instantaneous traffic conditions","heterogeneous LTE networks","dynamic adjustment performance analysis","neighboring cells","UE-UE intercell interference","BS-BS intercell interference","homogeneous macrocell TDD deployments","mutual interference","dynamic TDD adaptation","packet throughput performance","synchronous TDD networks","TDD UL-DL configuration dynamic adjustment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","dynamic TDD","heterogeneous networks","traffic adaptation"]}],"abstract":"The dynamic adjustment of TDD UL-DL configurations to the instantaneous traffic conditions at small cells (e.g. Pico cells) in heterogeneous LTE networks can be used to further optimize the system performance. The dynamic adaptation of TDD configuration may result in opposite transmission directions in the neighboring cells and thus cause BS-BS and UE-UE inter-cell interference that may significantly affect the overall system performance. To avoid this problem all homogeneous Macro cell TDD deployments typically operate synchronously. However in heterogeneous networks low power small cells are rather isolated from each other in terms of mutual interference and thus can be considered as candidates for dynamic TDD adaptation. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using dynamic adjustments of TDD UL-DL configurations in application to outdoor Pico cell deployments. In particular, we show the feasibility of using opposite DL and UL transmission directions in neighboring Pico cells in terms of interference environment. Furthermore we evaluate the performance benefits from traffic adaptation in LTE TDD networks where cells can dynamically select TDD configuration and show that substantial gains in packet throughput performance may be achieved comparing to the traditional synchronous TDD networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of dynamic adjustment of TDD uplink-downlink configurations in outdoor picocell LTE networks","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459791","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459791.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of dynamic adjustment of TDD uplink-downlink configurations in outdoor picocell LTE networks","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459791/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324463","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of dynamic adjustment of TDD uplink-downlink configurations in outdoor picocell LTE networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p914khoryaev.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056608S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459793,"authors":[{"name":"O.I.

We study a situation where a PU, while transmitting, can sense idle channels with a better transmission rate than the one currently occupied and can switch to such a better channel. This switching behaviour affects the PU activity profile on the channels and hence also the SU throughput, since SU packet transmissions are confined to the gaps left by the PUs. Different PU switching strategies are studied by developing a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) for each strategy. Performance measures include the mean sojourn time of PUs as well as the saturation throughput and interruption probability of SU packets. Some specific considered scenarios quantitatively demonstrate the influence of the PU switching speed. An increased PU switching rate considerably reduces PU sojourn time, at the cost of reducing the SU throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13324465","htmlLink":"/document/6459793/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the impact of primary user switching strategies in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the impact of primary user switching strategies in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p927salameh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083431S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459798,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Tahir Ozden","affiliation":["Piri Reis University, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet Tahir","lastName":"Ozden","id":"37727449200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459798","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Spectral analysis","Sensors","Vectors","Prediction algorithms","Equations","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","autoregressive moving average processes","channel bank filters","cognitive radio","digital signal processing chips","lattice filters","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multichannel sequential lattice prediction filtering method","cognitive radio spectrum sensing","subbands","multichannel characterization","autoregressive moving average","ARMA spectrum estimation","orthogonalization","input multichannel data","sequential processing multichannel lattice stages","matrix operations","multichannel ARMA prediction filter","FPGA","DSP chip based spectrum sensing functions","software defined radio implementations","Lattice reflection coefficients","Levinson-Durbin type multichannel conversion algorithm","fine spectrum sensing","prediction filter configurations","multitaper method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459798","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459798","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","abstract":"A multichannel characterization for autoregressive moving average(ARMA) spectrum estimation in subbands with applications to cognitive radio spectrum sensing is considered in this presentation. The fullband ARMA spectrum estimation can be realized in two-channels as a special form of this characterization. A complete orthogonalization of input multichannel data is accomplished using a modified form of sequential processing multichannel lattice stages. Matrix operations are avoided, only scalar operations are used, and a multichannel ARMA prediction filter with a highly modular and suitable structure for VLSI implementations is achieved. The filter is therefore considered as a good candidate for FPGA and DSP chip based spectrum sensing functions in software defined radio implementations. Lattice reflection coefficients for autoregressive and moving average parts are simultaneously computed. These coefficients are then converted to process parameters using a newly developed Levinson-Durbin type multichannel conversion algorithm, so that they can be utilized in the classification of the spectrum. Coarse and fine spectrum sensing can be accomplished using different prediction filter configurations. The computational complexity is given in terms of model order parameters. The performance of the proposed method is compared visually and statistically to that of the multitaper method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459638","startPage":"961","endPage":"968","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449582/6459638/06459798.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multichannel sequential lattice prediction filtering method for cognitive radio spectrum sensing in subbands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6459798/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multichannel sequential lattice prediction filtering method for cognitive radio spectrum sensing in subbands","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13324470","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multichannel sequential lattice prediction filtering method for cognitive radio spectrum sensing in subbands","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p961ozden.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064761S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449582","isNumber":"6459638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449582","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6459638","articleId":"6459798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6459803,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Namdar","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Namdar","id":"38228494300"},{"name":"Haci Ilhan","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Haci","lastName":"Ilhan","id":"37870630600"},{"name":"Lutfiye Durak-Ata","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Lutfiye","lastName":"Durak-Ata","id":"38547619200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2017-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2016-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2015-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6459803","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AWGN","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Simulation","Error analysis","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","radiotelemetry","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial spectrum utilization","energy detection","cognitive radio networks","chirp-z transform","CZT method","dispersed frequency spectrum","additive white Gaussian noise channels","Rayleigh channels","AWGN channels","ROC curves","optimal detection threshold expressions","spectrum sensing","spectrum monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","energy detection","optimal detection threshold","chirp-z transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459803","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459803","publicationTitle":"2012 IV International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems","abstract":"This paper proposes the use of chirp-z transform (CZT) in spectrum sensing to achieve higher frequency resolution in spectrum monitoring.

The effect of any modifications made by an adversary can be catastrophic in critical applications. Because of the stealthy nature of such insertions, it is extremely difficult to detect them using traditional testing and verification methods. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for detection of malicious alteration(s) in a third party soft intellectual property (IP) using a clever combination of sequential equivalence checking (SEC) and test generation. The use of powerful inductive invariants can prune a large illegal state space, and test generation helps to provide a sensitization path for nodes of interest. Results for a set of hard-to-verify designs show that our method can either ensure that the suspect design is free from the functional effect of any malicious change(s) or return a small group of most likely malicious signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449393/6459807/06459818.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","doi":"10.1109/THS.2012.6459818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2012.6459818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensuring trust of third-party hardware design with constrained sequential equivalence checking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","Circuit faults","Logic gates","Automatic test pattern generation","Vectors","Integrated circuit modeling","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial property","semiconductor device manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["third-party hardware design","constrained sequential equivalence checking","semiconductor design","catastrophic","third party soft intellectual property","IP","clever combination","sequential equivalence checking","SEC","test generation","powerful inductive invariants","illegal state space","hard-to-verify designs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring trust of third-party hardware design with constrained sequential equivalence checking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13325499","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring trust of third-party hardware design with constrained sequential equivalence checking","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"002202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07232S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449393","isNumber":"6459807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449393","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6459807","articleId":"6459818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459838,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Angel Martinez-Lorenzo","affiliation":["ALERT Center of Excellence for Department of Homeland Security, Gordon CenSSIS, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jose Angel","lastName":"Martinez-Lorenzo","id":"38546794400"},{"name":"Yolanda Rodriguez-Vaqueiro","affiliation":["ALERT Center of Excellence for Department of Homeland Security, Gordon CenSSIS, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yolanda","lastName":"Rodriguez-Vaqueiro","id":"38548475400"},{"name":"Carey M.

Therefore, automated methods of statistically identifying anomalous patterns within data in real time are important. Applications include the evaluation of ground surveillance scenery to locate lost individuals in the presence of wind-driven debris, the identification of traffic patterns and foliage locations. Additional use can be made of automated techniques on board space probes that are evaluating atmospheric and terrain disturbances on distant planets. As the volume of data grows and as the time criticality of the data products becomes more urgent, the importance of this automated analysis grows. In our paper we apply multiscale vector quantization to ground-based range-Doppler radar imagery. The vector quantization codebook that results is used to segment the background into regions of statistically similar backscatter range and Doppler variation. Within these regions, smaller scale patterns are used to identify anomalies associated with non-naturally occurring objects. The time progression of the anomaly location is further used to enhance the feature set that is used to ascribe a class to each of the anomalies. We introduce the viewer to the Applied Radar radar testbed data collection system that produced the data used in this study using block diagram and processing descriptions. We then present the GMTI imagery that was used for our study. Within that data we highlight the identified anomalies and give the feature set associated with each. These anomalies are produced by individuals, vehicles and naturally present foliage. Preliminary classifier results are then presented including spectrogram and color mapped images of the data, region feature tables, process flow charts and image examples of the vector codebook members that result. This paper is of interest to researchers involved in analyzing any kind of multidimensional time-varying scenes.","doi":"10.1109/THS.2012.6459870","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449393/6459807/06459870.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2012.6459870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The statistical identification of motion anomalies in ground moving target radar imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459870/","displayDocTitle":"The statistical identification of motion anomalies in ground moving target radar imagery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13309871","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459870/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The statistical identification of motion anomalies in ground moving target radar imagery","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"057250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053572S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449393","isNumber":"6459807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449393","xplore-issue":"6459807","articleId":"6459870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6459891,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Feng","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Feng","id":"38467924500"},{"name":"Ziyi Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Ziyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"38547812800"},{"name":"Kyeong-An Kwon","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong-An","lastName":"Kwon","id":"38547587600"},{"name":"Weidong Shi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Houston, USA"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37537057100"},{"name":"Bogdan Carbunar","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, USA","Computer Science Department, University of Houston"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Carbunar","id":"37273242500"},{"name":"Yifei Jiang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Houston"],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38239490600"},{"name":"Nhung Nguyen","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Houston, USA","School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University"],"firstName":"Nhung","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085942252"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2709-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2708-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6459891","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":165,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":2228},"abstract":"Securing the sensitive data stored and accessed from mobile devices makes user authentication a problem of paramount importance.

Besides extracting touch data from touchscreen equipped smartphones, FAST complements and validates this data using a digital sensor glove that we have built using off-the-shelf components. FAST leverages state-of-the-art classification algorithms to provide transparent and continuous mobile system protection. A notable feature is FAST 's continuous, user transparent post-login authentication. We use touch data collected from 40 users to show that FAST achieves a False Accept Rate (FAR) of 4.66% and False Reject Rate of 0.13% for the continuous post-login user authentication. The low FAR and FRR values indicate that FAST provides excellent post-login access security, without disturbing the honest mobile users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449393/6459807/06459891.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","doi":"10.1109/THS.2012.6459891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2012.6459891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous mobile authentication using touchscreen gestures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Smart phones","Mobile communication","Feature extraction","Decision trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","data gloves","gesture recognition","information retrieval","mobile computing","mobile handsets","pattern classification","touch sensitive screens"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["honest mobile users","post-login access security","FAR values","FRR values","continuous post-login user authentication","false reject rate","false accept rate","FAST continuous user transparent post-login authentication","transparent mobile system protection","continuous mobile system protection","state-of-the-art classification algorithms","off-the-shelf components","digital sensor glove","data validation","FAST complements","touchscreen equipped smart phones","touchscreen-based user authentication approach","finger-gestures authentication system using touchscreen","sensitive data access","sensitive data storage","touchscreen gestures","continuous mobile authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hand-held device","touch-screen","user-authentication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Continuous mobile authentication using touchscreen gestures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459891/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13309889","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous mobile authentication using touchscreen gestures","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"079178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109381S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449393","isNumber":"6459807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449393","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"6459807","articleId":"6459891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6459914,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Y.

UAVs can easily be controlled from a remote location. They are being used for critical operations, including offensive, reconnaissance, surveillance and other civilian missions. The need to secure these channels in a UAV system is one of the most important aspects of the security of this system because all information critical to the mission is sent through wireless communication channels. It is well understood that loss of control over these systems to adversaries due to lack of security is a potential threat to national security. In this paper various security threats to a UAV system is analyzed and a cyber-security threat model showing possible attack paths has been proposed. This model will help designers and users of the UAV systems to understand the threat profile of the system so as to allow them to address various system vulnerabilities, identify high priority threats, and select mitigation techniques for these threats.","doi":"10.1109/THS.2012.6459914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2012.6459914","startPage":"585","endPage":"590","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6449393/6459807/06459914.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyber security threat analysis and modeling of an unmanned aerial vehicle system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459914/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cyber security threat analysis and modeling of an unmanned aerial vehicle system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13309907","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6459914/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyber security threat analysis and modeling of an unmanned aerial vehicle system","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"104121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106798S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6449393","isNumber":"6459807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6449393","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6459807","articleId":"6459914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6459946,"authors":[{"name":"Seungwon Shin","affiliation":["SUCCESS Laboratory, Texas A and M University, USA"],"lastName":"Seungwon Shin","id":"38238907300"},{"name":"Guofei Gu","affiliation":["SUCCESS Laboratory, Texas A and M University, USA"],"lastName":"Guofei Gu","id":"37278628300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2447-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2445-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2446-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6459946","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2488},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Monitoring","Algorithm design and analysis","Routing","Virtual machining","Cloud computing","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CloudWatcher framework","network security monitoring","OpenFlow","dynamic cloud network","cloud computing","cloud environment","network security device","network packet","policy script","cloud network administrator","security monitoring-as-a-service"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is becoming a popular paradigm. Many recent new services are based on cloud environments, and a lot of people are using cloud networks. Since many diverse hosts and network configurations coexist in a cloud network, it is essential to protect each of them in the cloud network from threats. To do this, basically, we can employ existing network security devices, but applying them to a cloud network requires more considerations for its complexity, dynamism, and diversity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices. In addition, all these operations can be implemented by writing a simple policy script, thus, a cloud network administrator is able to protect his cloud network easily. We have implemented the proposed framework, and evaluated it on different test network environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459946","publicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424016/6459930/06459946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459930","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CloudWatcher: Network security monitoring using OpenFlow in dynamic cloud networks (or: How to provide security monitoring as a service in clouds?)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CloudWatcher: Network security monitoring using OpenFlow in dynamic cloud networks (or: How to provide security monitoring as a service in clouds?)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459946/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13309791","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6459946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CloudWatcher: Network security monitoring using OpenFlow in dynamic cloud networks (or: How to provide security monitoring as a service in clouds?)","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"JNPSec12Final1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052646S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424016","isNumber":"6459930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424016","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6459930","articleId":"6459946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6459948,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Weekly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Weekly","id":"37947217000"},{"name":"Kristofer Pister","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kristofer","lastName":"Pister","id":"37074713900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2447-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2445-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2446-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6459948","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":796},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Noise","Uncertainty","Authentication","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sinkhole defense technique","RPL network","detrimental effect","wireless sensor network","WSN","routing protocol","low-power network","lossy network","end-to-end delivery performance","parent fail-over technique","rank authentication technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication system security","Ad hoc networks","Routing protocols"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we present the results of a study on the detrimental effects of sinkhole attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) which employ the Routing Protocol for LLNs (Low-power and Lossy Networks). A sinkhole is a compromised node which attempts to capture traffic with the intent to drop messages, thus degrading the end-to-end delivery performance, that is, reducing the number of messages successfully delivered to their destination. The mechanism by which the sinkhole captures traffic is by advertising an attractive route to its neighbors. We evaluate two countermeasures addressing the sinkhole problem: a parent fail-over and a rank authentication technique. We show via simulation that while each technique, applied alone, does not work all that well, the combination of the two techniques significantly improves the performance of a network under attack. We also demonstrate that, with the defenses described, increasing the density of the network can combat a penetration of sinkholes nodes, without needing to identify the sinkholes.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459948","publicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424016/6459930/06459948.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating sinkhole defense techniques in RPL networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459948/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating sinkhole defense techniques in RPL networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13309792","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459948/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating sinkhole defense techniques in RPL networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"JNPSec12Final3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045307S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424016","isNumber":"6459930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424016","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6459930","articleId":"6459948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":6459964,"authors":[{"name":"Suchul Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suchul","lastName":"Lee","id":"38559829100"},{"name":"Chong-Kwon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chong-Kwon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292323000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2447-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2445-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2446-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6459964","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"abstract":"To exploit frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, instantaneous channel quality must be estimated. However, there is a trade-off between acquiring channel quality information and improving protocol efficiency because channel estimation consumes time and frequency resource that ideally should be used for data transfer. In this paper, we present D-Fi (Diversity-aware Wi-Fi), a novel Wi-Fi PHY/MAC protocol, that capitalizes on frequency diversity gains while sustaining protocol efficiency. The D-Fi design allows to estimate channel quality while D-Fi is performing channel contention using an OFDM-based Bloom filter. To resolve the ambiguity caused by the Bloom filter, we adopt two methods: (i) An analysis-based multi channel backoff method enables to explore/exploit frequency diversity while reducing the occurrence of the ambiguity. (ii) Applying machine learning (ML) methods to the D-Fi PHY/MAC protocol corrects the ambiguity taken place already and makes our protocol reliable. We have shown the feasibility of D-Fi by implementing it on the USRP/GNURadio platform. Experiments and trace-driven simulations show that D-Fi successfully achieves frequency diversity gains without losing improved protocol efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424016/6459930/06459964.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D-Fi: A diversity-aware Wi-Fi using an OFDM-based Bloom filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Channel estimation","Estimation","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel estimation","diversity reception","learning (artificial intelligence)","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["USRP/GNURadio platform","ML method","machine learning","analysis-based multichannel backoff method","channel contention","D-Fi design","frequency diversity gain","Wi-Fi PHY/MAC protocol","data transfer","protocol efficiency","channel quality information","instantaneous channel quality estimation","Wi-Fi channel","OFDM-based Bloom filter","diversity-aware Wi-Fi"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6459964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","displayDocTitle":"D-Fi: A diversity-aware Wi-Fi using an OFDM-based Bloom filter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6459964/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13309805","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D-Fi: A diversity-aware Wi-Fi using an OFDM-based Bloom filter","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"hicnp12final132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112845S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424016","isNumber":"6459930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424016","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6459930","articleId":"6459964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6459967,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Schier","affiliation":["University of Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schier","id":"37303752100"},{"name":"Michael Welzl","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Welzl","id":"37297256200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2447-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2445-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2446-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-1648"}],"articleNumber":"6459967","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6459967","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Linux","History","Loss measurement","Equations","Kernel","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCCP","datagram congestion control protocol","RFC","Linux implementation","network traversal problems","API","TFRC equation","CCID-3","live video streaming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459967","publicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424016/6459930/06459967.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using DCCP: Issues and improvements","abstract":"The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is no longer too young to be usable: the first RFCs were published in 2006, and a stable and quite complete Linux implementation exists.

This paper identifies some deficiencies of the current implementation - the lack of transparency in the API with regard to packet loss, the coarse granularity of the lookup table used to calculate the TFRC equation, and the lack of history discounting in CCID-3 - and demonstrates that they can significantly impair the performance of typical DCCP use cases such as live video streaming.
