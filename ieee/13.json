Since all bank addresses generated by these methods are random, constrained only by the bijective property, more conflicts tend to occur than in the more common MODULO method. Also LINEAR lacks the capability of MODULO to move several conflicting vector streams to a conflict-free steady state. To correct these deficiencies, a new class of random interleaving schemes called RANDOM-H that hash only the higher-order address bits is proposed. Unlike LINEAR, the RANDOM-H schemes randomize selectively, while retaining some of the advantages of MODULO. It is shown that RANDOM-H has a higher probability of accessing a vector without conflict than LINEAR. An an example of RANDOM-H, a method called MASH is presented that combines module interleaving with a multiplicative hashing function for randomization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '90:Proceedings of the 1990 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/297/3622/00130001.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '90:Proceedings of the 1990 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1990.130001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1990.130001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=130001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On randomly interleaved memories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interleaved codes","Random access memory","Bandwidth","Hardware","Delay","Computer architecture","Laboratories","Vector processors","Performance analysis","Multi-stage noise shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","memory architecture","parallel architectures","storage allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory address interleaving","vector processors","memory contention","randomly interleaved memories","random interleaving schemes","linear transformation","bank addresses","bijective property","conflicting vector streams","conflict-free steady state","RANDOM-H","MASH","module interleaving","multiplicative hashing function","randomization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"On randomly interleaved memories","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4012042","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On randomly interleaved memories","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00130001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050106S","chronDate":"12-16 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"297","citationCount":"32","articleId":"130001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":130017,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The MPC is a microprogrammable processor which offloads from the CPU the burden of communication and speeds up the software processing by directly executing message passing instructions in microcode. It supports process scheduling, message buffer management, and fast buffer copying. The most unique feature of the MPC is that it performs software caching for expected message destinations and buffers. The MPC works closely with a virtual channel router which is a smart routing controller and supports virtual channels and cached circuits. The software and hardware overhead of communication can be reduced significantly by these two processors. The performance is confirmed by trace-driven simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1990.130092","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '90:Proceedings of the 1990 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '90:Proceedings of the 1990 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/297/3622/00130092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1990.130092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3622","startPage":"720","endPage":"729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A message passing coprocessor for distributed memory multicomputers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=130092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A message passing coprocessor for distributed memory multicomputers","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130092/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Nov. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4012099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A message passing coprocessor for distributed memory multicomputers","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00130092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035906S","chronDate":"12-16 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"297","citationCount":"16","articleId":"130092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":130185,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Circuits constructed mainly from simple carry save adders and based on most-significant-bit (MSB) first arithmetic are described. Two methods resulting in systems which are 100% efficient in that they are capable of sampling data every cycle are presented. In the first approach the basic circuit is modified so that the level of pipelining used is compatible with the small, but fixed, latency associated with the computation in question. This is achieved through insertion of pipeline delays (half latches) one every second row of cells. This produces an area-efficient solution in which the throughput rate is determined by a critical path of 76 gate delays. A second approach combines the MSB first arithmetic methods with the scattered look-ahead methods. Important design issues are addressed, including wordlength truncation, overflow detection, and saturation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1990.130234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., 1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., 1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/308/3623/00130234.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"306","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1990.130234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized bit level architectures for IIR filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sep 1990","displayDocTitle":"Optimized bit level architectures for IIR filtering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4097041","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130234/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized bit level architectures for IIR filtering","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00130234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028296S","chronDate":"17-19 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"308","citationCount":"7","articleId":"130234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":130240,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

In COSINE-1, 36 transputer-accommodated boards are connected by optical links comprised of collimated optical beams and optical fibers. The 144*144 crossbar interconnections are manually rearranged by operating beam couplers which couple the fiber ends to the optical beams. The system was tested for a computer graphic machine, and no degradation of performance was observed in spite of mechanical tremors. COSINE-2 uses an optical Benes switch which can electrically control the interconnection network topology. Since the interconnection state is electrically changed during the system operation, the processor can be used more efficiently.

Genetic algorithms have been advocated for these kinds of problems where domain knowledge is either limited or hard to represent and formalize. The authors describe some initial experiments on the use of genetic algorithms to discover maximal distance codes, and discuss the potential advantage of genetic algorithms in this problem domain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4081972","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 1990","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discovery of maximal distance codes using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovery of maximal distance codes using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00130442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060887S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"312","citationCount":"15","articleId":"130442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":130473,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

There are four possible classification categories: normal, stenosis of the nondominant circumflex coronary artery, stenosis of the left anterior descending, or stenosis of the right coronary artery, including the posterior descending. Two different neural network algorithms are applied to the scintigraphic data: the backpropagation method and the Kohonen algorithm. The backpropagation network consists of three layers of neurodes and utilizes the Delta rule as the learning rule. The Kohonen method involves a single layer of neurodes which uses an unsupervised learning rule to cluster the different classes of data. Both networks are trained using 70% of the scintigraphic data, with the remainder of the data used for testing. The results obtained by using backpropagation are fair with an accuracy of 66.6%. The results from the Kohonen algorithm are better, especially in terms of specificities for both abnormal and normal patients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1989.130473","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"[1989] Proceedings.

Since it is now recognized that ST-T changes are highly relevant for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, it was agreed that the project should concentrate on setting up a standard for annotating ST-T changes. The pilot study, completed at the end of 1986, set up a small prototype database. After the project ended, it was decided that the interest shown by research groups and manufacturers warranted developing the full database. Thirteen groups from eight countries agreed to provide AECG tapes and to contribute to the annotations. So far, 106 AECG records, out of 175 submitted, have been admitted to the database and 96 have each been annotated by two different groups. Disagreements between the annotations have been analyzed for estimation of reliability. The first release of the database comprises 50 annotated records stored on CD-ROM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1989.130497","publicationTitle":"[1989] Proceedings.

Using a five-term KL expansion of a 200-ms interval, which includes the QRS complex and part of the ST segment, one can represent morphology on two simultaneous ECG (electrocardiographic) leads with sufficient fidelity for beat classification. The residual error of the representation is an ideal estimate of the instantaneous noise content of the signal and permits identification of events for which the morphologic information is unreliable. The authors have compared the performance of the current KL-based arrhythmia analysis program with its predecessor (which uses a set of time-domain features for morphology representation but is otherwise identical to the newer program). In evaluations using the MIT-BIH and AHA (American Heart Association) databases, and a newly developed database containing approximately 2.5 million annotated beats (including over 80000 premature ventricular contractions) from 27 long-term ECG recordings, it was found that beat classification errors using the KL transform were as little as one-fourth of those for the older program.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130540/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"4012855","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"QRS morphology representation and noise estimation using the Karhunen-Loeve transform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QRS morphology representation and noise estimation using the Karhunen-Loeve transform","confLoc":"Jerusalem, Israel","sourcePdf":"00130540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027717S","chronDate":"19-22 Sep 1989","isNumber":"3625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"324","citationCount":"29","articleId":"130540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":130626,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

The author questions this categorization, and discusses channels that cannot be clearly identified as either storage or timing channels, but have aspects of both. A new model of timing channels is presented, which allows for channels that have characteristics of both storage channels and timing channels, and a method is given for constructing all channels in a computer system that have timing channel characteristics. Since R.A. Kemmerer's (1982) shared resource matrix methodology has the potential to detect all channels that have storage characteristics, the two methods jointly have the capability to construct all channels in a computer system. The approach to timing channels provides a justification of specific mechanisms for reducing their bandwidth which were employed in the VAX Virtual Machine Monitor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RISP.1991.130767","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/349/3628/00130767.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RISP.1991.130767","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy","startPage":"2","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of covert timing channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=130767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of covert timing channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130767/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4050369","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of covert timing channels","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00130767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040831S","chronDate":"20-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"349","citationCount":"72","articleId":"130767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":130768,"authors":[{"name":"W.-M.

In order to allow for the most general patterns of program sharing, a standard epidemiological model is extended by placing it on a directed graph and a combination of analysis and simulation is used to study its behavior. The conditions under which epidemics are likely to occur are determined, and, in cases where they do, the dynamics of the expected number of infected individuals are examined as a function of time. It is concluded that an imperfect defense against computer viruses can still be highly effective in preventing their widespread proliferation, provided that the infection rate does not exceed a well-defined critical epidemic threshold.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/130801/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4050394","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Directed-graph epidemiological models of computer viruses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directed-graph epidemiological models of computer viruses","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00130801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045381S","chronDate":"20-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"349","citationCount":"336","articleId":"130801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":130964,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

A fast method is proposed and used to evaluate the generating units and transmission capability of a power system and calculate the optimal reserve of each demand side, based on a two-step linear programming technique. A new support tool for power system planning is described by using the parametric linear programming. This support tool quickly gives an optimal reserve curve of the system and also provides some diagnosis information of the systems weak location for the expansion planning and maintenance scheduling of transmission lines or generating units. The outages of generators and transmission lines are considered, and a method of estimating the reliability (LOLP) of a multiarea power system by making use of linear programming is presented. Several examples are used to verify the proposed methodology and illustrate the application. The results show that the approaches are simple, fast, and efficient support tools for generation and transmission capability evaluation or for the contingency testing of a power system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.131045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3635/00131045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.131045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3635","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power arrival evaluation of bulk system including network constraints based on linear programming approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power arrival evaluation of bulk system including network constraints based on linear programming approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3893376","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power arrival evaluation of bulk system including network constraints based on linear programming approach","sourcePdf":"00131045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027548S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"3635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"12","articleId":"131045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131054,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

This margin is aimed at assessing the system robustness with respect to voltage collapse. The corresponding collapse point is directly obtained as the solution of an optimization problem with the load increase as the objective, the nonoptimized loads as equality constraints, and the generator reactive limits as inequality constraints. The CRIC electrical decoupling yields a voltage-only problem. The latter is solved using the Newton approach and a procedure is given to deal with the inequality constraints efficiently.

Staged fault tests were extensively carried out in Korean electric power systems. From the analysis of the staged fault test data, it was found that there exists an intermittent arcing phenomenon in most high-impedance faults and that the waveforms of this arcing fault current have an asymmetrical shape in each cycle. Based on these facts, three criteria, (even-order power, even-order ratio, and even-order incremental variance) for fault detection are presented, all of which are based on the changes of normalized even-order harmonic power in fault currents. These criteria are compared through the analysis of staged fault data and normal switching event data. It is shown that the even-order incremental variance criterion is superior to the other two criteria and that, with this criterion, high-impedance faults can be distinguished from normal switching events, including special loads such as electric furnaces and subways. Microprocessor-based protective relays, which can detect high-impedance faults by using the proposed methods, have been constructed, installed in Korea Electric Power Corporation substations, and tested during the last two years. Details of these field tests are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.131112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/3636/00131112.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.131112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High impedance fault detection utilizing incremental variance of normalized even order harmonic power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131112/","displayDocTitle":"High impedance fault detection utilizing incremental variance of normalized even order harmonic power","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3932536","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High impedance fault detection utilizing incremental variance of normalized even order harmonic power","sourcePdf":"00131112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047886S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"3636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"52","articleId":"131112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131115,"authors":[{"name":"V.C.

The basic idea behind this system is to provide a nonexpert with the necessary information and interaction in order to make a fault diagnosis through the substation alarms in a very friendly environment. The main task of the system is to replace the troubleshooting manuals of substation equipment and human expertise in substation fault diagnosis and alarm processing with a user-friendly computer environment and to take advantage of the user's accumulated experience to expand and modify the knowledge base of the expert system.

Model results are compared with measured turn-on and turn-off waveforms for different drive, load, and feedback circuits and for different IGBT base lifetimes. The effective output capacitance of the IGBT at turn-off is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the structurally equivalent power MOSFET and depends upon the device base lifetime because the base charge at turn-off depends upon the device base lifetime.

A three-loop control strategy for the multimodule converter system with a secondary output filter is developed. Significant improvements of small-signal performance and module-failure response are achieved using additional feedback from the intermediate filter stage. The small-signal analysis of the three-loop controlled converter is performed, focusing on the effects of the local voltage feedback on the closed-loop performance of the system.

The describing function of an ideal comparator (no time delays or slew rate limits) has no phase shift and is independent of frequency. It is found that turn-on delay and turn-off delay have different effects on gain and phase and cannot be combined. Comparator hysteresis affects both gain and phase; likewise, time delays generally affect both gain and phase. It is found that the effective time delay around the feedback loop is one half the sum of turn-on and turn-off delays, regardless of whether the delays are caused by storage time or slew rate limits.

The new model for DCM operation does not have RHP zeros in the current feedback loop, but the buck converter exhibits an instability for higher conversion ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1990.131213","publicationTitle":"21st Annual IEEE Conference on Power Electronics Specialists","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Annual IEEE Conference on Power Electronics Specialists","pdfPath":"/iel2/146/3637/00131213.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1990.131213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new continuous-time model for current-mode control with constant frequency, constant on-time, and constant off-time, in CCM and DCM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131213/","displayDocTitle":"A new continuous-time model for current-mode control with constant frequency, constant on-time, and constant off-time, in CCM and DCM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3809565","conferenceDate":" 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new continuous-time model for current-mode control with constant frequency, constant on-time, and constant off-time, in CCM and DCM","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00131213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022974S","chronDate":"0-0  1990","isNumber":"3637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"146","citationCount":"90","articleId":"131213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131214,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

Switching between the voltage vectors is achieved on the basis of a desired trajectory for the state flux vector, which determines the airgap torque of the AC machine. This strategy with constant switching periods and duty cycles proportional to the voltage amplitude makes it possible to operate with a one-dimensional look-up table, conventional digital control schemes with constant sampling periods, and full synchronization between controllers and the switching process in the PWM-inverter. The fundamental current component can be obtained directly by sampling twice in each switching period without filtering, and the controller sampling period can be half the switching period, which makes it possible to exploit the maximum torque bandwidth of the AC drive.

Although Ferrite (PC40) is lossier than Permalloy80 (0.5 mil) at the frequencies of interest (25-50 kHz) the use of the former is justified on the basis of cost, weight, and wide ranges of shapes. The influence of the leakage flux distribution in the window region on the copper losses has been demonstrated for various conventional winding arrangements. However, it is seen that in conventionally wound transformers a considerable amount of leakage flux enters the core, resulting in localized core saturation and hot-spots. This becomes a very critical issue for high-power, high-frequency transformers. Coaxially wound transformers are seen to be a viable alternative, in that the leakage flux is contained with the interwinding space, with very little or none of it permeating the core. Such transformers can also realize multiple benefits of a low distributed and controllable leakage inductance, robust construction, low electromechanical forces, and low core and copper losses. Test results on two coaxially wound transformers with different tube geometries, designed for 50 kW, 50 kHz, primary voltage of 200 V, and secondary voltage of 1000 V (two windings), are presented. Finally the concept of coaxial winding technique for three-phase transformers is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1990.131262","publicationTitle":"21st Annual IEEE Conference on Power Electronics Specialists","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Annual IEEE Conference on Power Electronics Specialists","pdfPath":"/iel2/146/3637/00131262.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1990.131262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for high power high frequency transformers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131262/","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for high power high frequency transformers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3809605","conferenceDate":" 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for high power high frequency transformers","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00131262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047252S","chronDate":"0-0  1990","isNumber":"3637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"146","citationCount":"58","articleId":"131262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131264,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The proposed UPS consists of a high-frequency inverter, a high-frequency transformer, and a cycloconverter with a new voltage clamper. The clamper effectively reduces the power loss of the conversion system. The voltage clamper gave an improved DC-AC conversion efficiency of about 10% more than when a conventional RC snubber was used. When source-commutation was used, DC-AC conversion efficiency was improved by about 5%. When the voltage clamper was used both DC-AC conversion efficiency and the output voltage characteristic without the automatic voltage regulator were improved to source commutation. Fabrication of a 10 kVA high-frequency-link DC-AC power converter is described and its loss reduction effect is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1990.131264","publicationTitle":"21st Annual IEEE Conference on Power Electronics Specialists","displayPublicationTitle":"21st Annual IEEE Conference on Power Electronics Specialists","pdfPath":"/iel2/146/3637/00131264.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"756","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1990.131264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frequency link DC-AC converter for UPS with a new voltage clamper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1990","displayDocTitle":"High frequency link DC-AC converter for UPS with a new voltage clamper","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":" 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3809607","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131264/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frequency link DC-AC converter for UPS with a new voltage clamper","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00131264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023119S","chronDate":"0-0  1990","isNumber":"3637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"146","citationCount":"52","articleId":"131264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":131270,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

A three-phase 3 kW IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) based 60 kHz resonant link inverter has been constructed and successfully tested with an induction motor drive.

Criteria are derived to determine the allowable range of variation in DC output voltage for a power module operating in a multiple-source, multiple-load system with a backplane interconnect. These criteria impose constraints on output voltage as a consequence of load voltage specifications, and of current-sharing accuracy required of the sources. An algorithm for implementing the solution of these criteria is presented. Computational results for two examples of power distribution systems using this algorithm are presented. The advantage of the system model is that a complete description is provided for a generalized power bus system, which may include ground and power planes of arbitrary geometry. The advantages of the algorithm are that the constraints determined for source voltage are valid under all combinations of load variation and source voltage variation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3809623","conferenceDate":" 1990","displayDocTitle":"Determining current sharing criterion for parallel operation of power converters in multi-module bus systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining current sharing criterion for parallel operation of power converters in multi-module bus systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00131280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025202S","chronDate":"0-0  1990","isNumber":"3637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"146","citationCount":"15","articleId":"131280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131371,"authors":[{"name":"S.-S.

It is shown how a monotone query-processing strategy can be implemented, making effective use of semantic information presented by the object-oriented view.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Apr 1991","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4012734","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An object-oriented query processor that produces monotonically improving approximate answers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An object-oriented query processor that produces monotonically improving approximate answers","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00131496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033868S","chronDate":"8-12 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"333","citationCount":"9","articleId":"131496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":131499,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The repeating history paradigm of ARIES is analyzed to propose a more efficient handling of redos, especially when the smallest granularity of locking is not less than a page, by combining the paradigm of selective redo from DB2 V1. Even with fine-granularity locking, it is not always the case that all the unapplied but logged changes needed to be redone. ARIES-RRH, which incorporates these changes, still retains all the good properties of ARIES-avoiding undo of undos, single-pass media recovery, nested top actions, etc. The fundamentals behind why DB2 V1's selective redo works, in spite of failures during restart recovery, are also explained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131521/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4012759","conferenceDate":"8-12 April 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ARIES-RRH: restricted repeating of history in the ARIES transaction recovery method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARIES-RRH: restricted repeating of history in the ARIES transaction recovery method","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00131521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06426S","chronDate":"8-12 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"333","citationCount":"11","articleId":"131521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131545,"authors":[{"name":"C.

With respect to the authors' previous work, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system resulting from the approach presented is not conditioned by a particular type of inertia matrix variations. On the other hand, the introduction of an adaptation loop may also be motivated by a reduction of chattering at control law level since the control law only depends on the estimated state and parameter vectors, and hence contains no terms proportional to discontinuities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Robots","Manipulators","Proportional control","Robust control","State feedback","Velocity measurement","Observers","Asymptotic stability","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","parameter estimation","robots","stability","state estimation","state-space methods","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","parameter estimation","state estimation","controller design","robot","manipulators","velocity estimated feedback","parameter adaptation","observer gains","reduced-order manifold","invariance","asymptotic stability","closed-loop system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131545","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131545.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"21 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of robot manipulators via velocity estimated feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of robot manipulators via velocity estimated feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131545/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4076675","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of robot manipulators via velocity estimated feedback","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133983S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"3","articleId":"131545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":131556,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The main idea of task-level learning is that a given task can be viewed as an input-output system driven by a vector of input variables or commands and responding with a vector of output variables or performance indicators. This formulation allows the application of powerful numerical methods to problems at a high-level of performance measurement: the task level. Task-level learning is studied as a paradigm than may help to program machines to learn from experience in order to: (1) perform a task better over time, (2) optimize task performance, and (3) generalize knowledge over tasks. Some extensions to the paradigm are explored. A refined model learning scheme is presented. Simulation experiments are performed to test the effects of different inverse models, different learning schemes, and different learning intervals.

Obstacles are modeled as nonconducting solids in a conducting medium. The starting point is modeled as a current source and the goal as an equal and opposite current sink. It is shown that this formulation is considerably more powerful than the recent potential-field algorithm of C.I. Connolly et al. (1990), particularly when navigating long, narrow corridors. Feasible paths for navigation are current streamlines, as demonstrated by the results of software simulations in a 2D Euclidean plane. One of the principal advantages of the method is that it can be implemented with parallel analog hardware in the form of a resistive grid. With analog VLSI chips, it will be possible to plan paths for realistic environments in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131636","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131636.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"545 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analogue computation of collision-free paths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analogue computation of collision-free paths","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4081988","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analogue computation of collision-free paths","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030181S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"54","articleId":"131636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":131651,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The hyper-redundant manipulators are broken nonredundant segments which have closed form inverse kinematic solutions. The kinematic constraints for each segment are specified independently by the backbone curve, and the kinematics of the total manipulator can therefore be solved in parallel.

Force control is implemented to insure that the maximum normal force applied to the object at the contacts is set to a prespecified level whenever possible.

An interesting aspect is that apparent tendon stiffness changes when the tendon is pulled or loosened, while tendon stiffness itself keeps constant under the absence of friction. This unexpected behavior is confirmed by simulations as well as experiments. The authors also consider the effect of apparent tendon stiffness on force control and show that the direction-dependent behavior of apparent tendon stiffness eventually brings about a direction-dependent response in the force control system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131727/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4091227","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A new consideration on tendon-tension control system of robot hands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new consideration on tendon-tension control system of robot hands","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048388S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"52","articleId":"131727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":131747,"authors":[{"name":"B. d'Andrea-Novel","affiliation":["Centre d'Automatique, Ecole des Mines de Paris, Fontainebleau, France"],"firstName":"B.","lastName":"d'Andrea-Novel","id":"38275543700"},{"name":"G.

The procedure starts by computing a control that steers the given initial point to the desired target point for an extended system, in which a number of Lie brackets of the system vector fields are added. Using formal calculations with a product expansion relative to P. Hall basis, another control is produced that achieves the desired result on the formal level. This provides an exact solution of the original problem if the given system is nilpotent. For a general system, an iterative algorithm is derived that converges very quickly to a solution. For nonnilpotent systems which are feedback nilpotentizable, the algorithm, in cascade with a precompensator, produces an exact solution.

This problem was initially observed and analyzed by C.A. Klein and C.H. Huang (1983). T. Shamir and Y. Yomdin (1988) recently analyzed this problem using a differential geometric approach. The above papers arrived at conditions under which a cyclic path in the work space does not result in a cyclic path in the joint space. However, it was not clear that these conditions were equivalent. It is presently shown that these two criteria are indeed equivalent. A measure for the drift motion is presented. The mathematical analysis given in the present paper can determine these predictable properties of drift motion. It is shown that the Lyapunov analysis and phase portrait techniques can be used to predict the stability behavior of drift utilizing the drift density measure described here. Information about how much drift will occur and which configurations are stable can be obtained from the analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131766.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1168 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measure of joint path drift for kinematically redundant robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Motion control","Jacobian matrices","Motion measurement","Mathematical analysis","Motion analysis","Stability analysis","Density measurement","Phase measurement","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","Lyapunov methods","position control","robots","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","joint path drift","kinematically redundant robots","Jacobian pseudo-inverses","drift motion","Lyapunov analysis","phase portrait","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Measure of joint path drift for kinematically redundant robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4091247","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measure of joint path drift for kinematically redundant robots","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031794S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"4","articleId":"131766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":131786,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By applying constraint control to the robot body so that it moves on a particular straight line and rotates at a constant angular velocity, the dynamics of the center of mass of the body becomes completely linear. Such motion of the ideal model is called the linear inverted pendulum mode, and it is used to develop the control scheme of the biped walking on rugged terrain. Under the control method in the linear inverted pendulum mode, walking on a particular rugged ground is shown to be equivalent to walking on a level ground. It is also shown that the additional use of the ankle torque makes the proposed control scheme robust and applicable to a real biped robot with mass legs.

A key component of this approach is the measurement of the distance between the desired and the achieved response through the use of H/sub infinity / norm. The design process attempts to minimize this distance, subject to other constraints such as control authority limitations. This scheme allows for the independent design of mechanical admittance, sensitivity, and tracking bandwidth provided an output torque sensor is available on the actuator. In the absence of such a sensor, this methodology allows either the sensitivity requirements or the admittance requirements to be met, but generally not both. It is shown that both the torque-based and the position-based impedance control design approaches can be formulated within this three-part design methodology. The design methodology was demonstrated by applying it to a fourth-order harmonic drive actuator model with inner torque-loop control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131825","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1487 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131825.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attaining impedance control objectives using H/sub infinity / design methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","H infinity control","Design methodology","Admittance","Mechanical sensors","Actuators","Minimization methods","Process design","Bandwidth","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","mechanical variables control","minimisation","optimal control","position control","robots","sensitivity analysis","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","position control","torque control","design","manipulator","impedance control","H/sub infinity / minimization","mechanical admittance","sensitivity","tracking bandwidth","fourth-order harmonic drive actuator model","inner torque-loop control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Attaining impedance control objectives using H/sub infinity / design methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","accessionNumber":"4097105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attaining impedance control objectives using H/sub infinity / design methods","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031639S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"15","articleId":"131825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":131833,"authors":[{"name":"F.C.

The results of the experimental evaluation show that the relationship between the input and the output of the machining process can be effectively simulated with neural networks and that an adaptive optimal control system based on the neural network works reasonably well. The perceptron neural network technique is more favorable than conventional techniques in the sense that it assumes minimal a priori knowledge about the structure due to the self-organizing property of the neural network, and the nonlinearities of the system can be effectively modeled.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131840","startPage":"1567","endPage":"1572 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131840.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive optimal control of machining process using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131840/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive optimal control of machining process using neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4097117","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive optimal control of machining process using neural networks","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084015S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"2","articleId":"131840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":131850,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The construction is of fiber-reinforced rubber, and the mechanism is very simple. Gentle miniature robots with no conventional links can be designed using this design. The FMA's basic characteristics and its applications to certain robot mechanisms are presented. Serially connected FMAs act as a miniature robot manipulator.

Further, the control is seen to have a number of highly desirable features, making it attractive for use in industrial manufacturing settings. The constrained motion controller of N.H. McClamroch and D. Wang (1988) has also been implemented. Tests with this control indicate that its performance is as predicted from theory.

Extensive experimental results confirm the correctness of the model, the equivalence of the controllers, and the efficacy of this impact control strategy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131895","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131895.pdf","startPage":"1854","endPage":"1860 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=131895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental verification of a strategy for impact control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental verification of a strategy for impact control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4106524","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental verification of a strategy for impact control","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02778S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"44","articleId":"131895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":131932,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

To accomplish specific tasks in unstructured environments, it is essential to have capabilities of recognizing the object position with respect to the manipulator hand. Using the Jacobian matrix relating the camera motion to the object position change in the acquired image, a state space formulation of a visual feedback system is established. On the basis of the task defined in the image plane, the desired motion of the hand is achieved by time-variant state feedback. The image-based scheme is applied to a task of tracking a moving object by the camera (and the hand). Simulations show that the control scheme is stable even under noisy conditions, while the conventional position-based servo tends to be unstable. Experiments on a PUMA 560 show the validity and the effectiveness of the image-based visual servo.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131968/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4111945","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Manipulator control with image-based visual servo","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manipulator control with image-based visual servo","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044814S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"185","articleId":"131968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":131973,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Previous work where estimation of the parameters of a plant was incorporated through exploratory schedules (ESs) which are reference input trajectories designed to enhance the learning of system parameters, is extended. In that work, ESs were generated offline and used in an open-loop fashion. Moreover, these ESs were used in between actual control tasks, therefore limiting the process of estimation during idle time. In this work the authors present an approach for generating ESs in a closed-loop manner. Such trajectories in general may not be the desired trajectories, since they result in larger tracking errors. However, ESs offer faster convergence to the system parameters and therefore yield smaller long-term tracking errors. The automation for the design of ESs requires online modification of the desired trajectory to enhance learning at the expense of poorer initial tracking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131988","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"2434","endPage":"2435 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00131988.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Trajectory","Adaptive control","Programmable control","Robot control","Design optimization","Design engineering","Parameter estimation","Processor scheduling","Open loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","learning systems","parameter estimation","position control","robots","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","learning control","multiobjective optimization","exploratory schedules","learning of system","tracking errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to learning control via multiobjective optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/131988/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4102049","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to learning control via multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00131988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076532S","chronDate":"9-11 April 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","articleId":"131988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":131990,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Conditions for a given data sample to satisfy in order to generate a consistent mapping are obtained by using Lipschitz's condition, which is known as a condition for the continuity of functions. Prior to the training of neural networks, sample data are examined and validated with Lipschitz's condition, which guarantees the consistency.

These conditions cause many road following systems to fail. The authors have build a system, UNSCARF, which is based on pattern recognition techniques, for successfully navigating on a variety of unstructured roads. UNSCARF does not need a road location prediction to find the location of the road; therefore, UNSCARF can be used as a bootstrapping system. It uses a clustering technique to group pixels with similar colors and locations. It then matches models of road shape to locate the roads in the image. These methods are more robust in noisy conditions than other road interpretation techniques. UNSCARF has been integrated into a navigation system that has successfully driven a test vehicle in may types of weather conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.132000","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00132000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.132000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","startPage":"2496","endPage":"2501 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UNSCARF-a color vision system for the detection of unstructured roads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=132000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"UNSCARF-a color vision system for the detection of unstructured roads","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/132000/","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4102059","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UNSCARF-a color vision system for the detection of unstructured roads","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00132000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035213S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"92","articleId":"132000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":132012,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It is also an example of a polynomial neural network (PNN). The PNN can be trained to interpolate an unknown function by observing few samples. The PNN, a major type of neural network used in airborne combat applications is used to interpolate robot forward and inverse kinematics computations (FKC and IKC). The FKC and IKC are used, respectively, to find the mapping from the joint space to the Cartesian space and to find the mapping from the Cartesian space to joint space. A PPN simulation software package has been developed for solving both FKC and IKC. The simulation is performed in a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator. The solutions of the FKC and IKC networks are compared with the analytic equations. The PNN learns successfully the indicated path. The simulation results show that the PNN can interpolate the indicated path with better than 99.87% accuracy when the PNN network has been trained on 361 data pairs. The approach can be expanded to six-degree-of-freedom manipulators. Detailed GMDH algorithms for constructing the PNN kinematics models are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1991.132027","pdfPath":"/iel2/347/3640/00132027.pdf","startPage":"2638","endPage":"2643 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1991.132027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot kinematics learning computations using polynomial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/132027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Robot kinematics learning computations using polynomial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4102080","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot kinematics learning computations using polynomial neural networks","confLoc":"Sacramento, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00132027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031933S","chronDate":"9-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"347","citationCount":"5","articleId":"132027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":132028,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Although this may be possible using intensity images, the authors use range images which directly provide access to three-dimensional information. The first problem that needs to be solved is to find the transformation between the different views. Previous approaches have either assumed this transformation to be known (which is extremely difficult for a complete model) or computed it with feature matching (which is not accurate enough for integration. The authors propose an approach that works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views. This is performed by minimizing a functional that does not require point-to-point matches.

The system was initially developed as part of a clinical image data base project and although the VAX processors are well suited for the storage, retrieval and display of two dimensional tomographic images they are not sufficiently powerful to extend the applications to modern image processing techniques such as dynamic studies, three dimensional (3D) shaded surface display and artificial intelligence (AI) based image interpretation. Although they can handle the data for specific signal processing requirements such as the three dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processing required for volume data now being collected from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scanning techniques the processing time required would be prohibitive.

For instance in areas of image processing, as multiresolution representations or high definition television, one has to modify sampling structures. For these types of processing finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters offer two main advantages, firstly a strictly linear phase, or a zero-phase, characteristic can be easily obtained, secondly they avoid the stability problem inherent to infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. In this paper, the design problem is stated for two-dimensional (2-D FIR) digital filters in the context of a transformation, defined by two integer parameters, which allows the conversion, in both directions, from an orthogonal to a quincunx sampling structure, which will be called (L,K) structure. The filter coefficients are obtained after a minimisation of the maximum error in the frequency domain where some constraints, depending on the parameters L and K, are added. Finally, a test picture is used to illustrate two conversion schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","startPage":"275","endPage":"279","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Image Processing and its Applications, 1989.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1229/3641/00132134.pdf","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Image Processing and its Applications, 1989.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling pattern conversion with 2-D FIR filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"Sampling pattern conversion with 2-D FIR filters","conferenceDate":"18-20 July 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3545020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/132134/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling pattern conversion with 2-D FIR filters","confLoc":"Warwick, UK","sourcePdf":"00132134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018951S","chronDate":"18-20 Jul 1989","isNumber":"3641","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1229","citationCount":"6","articleId":"132134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":132137,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Most of these approaches calculate the motion vectors either by evaluating spatio-temporal gradients in a differential approach, or comparing shifted image parts in a block matching approach. The aim of this contribution is to show the gain which can be obtained by additional compensation of rotational motion in comparison with the compensation of translational motion alone.

Two types of undesirable equilibria are described along with strategies for avoiding or escaping them. The first strategy, introducing symmetry breaking noise, is a technique which is sufficient to escape from unstable equilibria. Other techniques must be used to prevent a network from settling in undesirable but stable states. Modifying the initial state of an amplifier and reducing its gain are two techniques which are capable of enabling certain networks to escape unfeasible but stable states. If the gain of an amplifier is reduced to escape an unfeasible state, it is important to return the gain to the minimum value which will enable it to reach a digital final state.

Finally, analysis of the FFT beamformer performance by simulation is compared with the beamformer performance predicted by the statistical analysis technique. The theoretical results, which were derived as worst-case analysis, were shown to be consistent with the simulation results.

The authors implement the algorithm using the Prolog interpreter POPLOG in a Sun 3/160. However, the algorithm is slow since a large number of rules have to be generated, even for the best predefined orderings. If the algorithm is extended to handle conditional equations, then it is even slower. However, the most time-consuming steps can be done in parallel. The authors investigate the use of the parallel architecture of the connection machine and of Sequent Balance 8000 to speed up the algorithm. They use Lisp on the connection machine and Prolog on the Sequent and compare the two architectures as well as the languages as far as the efficiency is concerned.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

To measure the bit error probability, it is necessary to know the statistics of the data, jammer, and noise signals at the output of the correlator. If the power of jammer signal is much higher than that of noise signal at the output of the integrator, then the noise can be ignored. Coherent synchronization is assumed throughout. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the analytical results. According to the resulting curves, BPSK/BPSK and OQPSK/BPSK have the same performance, This result is not surprising because it has been shown previously; however, the authors' technique for computing the performance is much simpler than the previous methods and is computationally inexpensive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The codes used for the CDMA systems are Gold codes, which are obtained from preferred pairs of maximal-length sequences. Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the degradation of CDMA systems as the number of users increases, with fixed-length sequences, and the improvement of system performance with increased sequence length. In addition to the interference of the other users, the performance of the CDMA systems is evaluated in terms of the background noise.

The object recognition subsystem exhibits aspects of both structural/relational and decision-theoretic pattern recognition. Two key aspects of the architecture are: (1) the ability to extract and aggregate features in a hierarchical manner, such that a large number of object classes and subclasses can be recognized; and (2) the ability to transition from location-dependent feature information to location-independent feature information, such that rotational-, scale-, and translational-invariant classification is possible.

The interleaving technique is shown to be applicable to all filter structures; however, it decreases the speedup of processing rate due to zero-interleaving of input and output sequences. The speedup can be improved by interleaving several sequences. The delay technique has a linear increase in speedup; however, it introduces latency and is not applicable to all filter structures, especially IIR (infinite impulse response) filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1989.132610","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

This avoids the necessity of making floating point calculations and realizes the benefits of lookup-table methods. The frame times for the CC memory solutions are dependent on the number of bits needed to accurately represent variables and coefficients, and only a slight increase in frame time occurs as system order is increased. Assembly language programs for a two-input two-output second-order system, a three-input three-output second-order system and a two-input two-output fourth-order system have been written. The simplicity of these programs shows the usefulness of CC memory for modeling multivariable systems.

Experience with many silicon-cochlea chips has allowed the identification of a number of important design issues, namely dynamic range, stability, device mismatch, and compactness. In this, paper, the original design is discussed in light of these issues, and circuit and layout techniques are described which significantly improve its performance, robustness, and efficiency.

In wave pipelining, multiple coherent waves of data are sent through a block of combinational logic by applying new inputs faster than the delay through the logic. The throughput of a 63-b CML (current mode logic) population counter was increased from 97 to 250 MHz using wave pipelining. The internal circuit is flow-through combinational logic. Novel CAD methods have balanced all input-to-output paths to about the same delay. This allows multiple data waves to propagate in sequence when the circuit is clocked faster than its propagation delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3652/00133161.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.133161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.133161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=133161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bipolar population counter using wave pipelining to achieve 2.5* normal clock frequency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Counting circuits","Pipeline processing","Clocks","Frequency","Propagation delay","Registers","Logic","Design automation","Algorithm design and analysis","Combinational circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar integrated circuits","combinatorial circuits","counting circuits","emitter-coupled logic","integrated logic circuits","large scale integration","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar LSI chip","bipolar population counter","wave pipelining","digital systems","combinational logic","CML","current mode logic","250 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"A bipolar population counter using wave pipelining to achieve 2.5* normal clock frequency","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4175504","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bipolar population counter using wave pipelining to achieve 2.5* normal clock frequency","sourcePdf":"00133161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043581S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"26","articleId":"133161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":133165,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

The internal numbers are represented in radix-2 redundant digit form, and the inputs and the output of the adder are represented in two's-complement binary form. The adder operands are added first in a radix-2 redundant adder to produce the result in radix-2 digit (-1, 0, 1) form. This result is converted to two's-complement binary form using the parallel conversion scheme. The high-speed conversion for long words is achieved through the use of a novel sign-select operation. The proposed adder, referred to as the sign-select conversion adder, is faster than all previous high-speed two's-complement binary adders for large word lengths. The implementation is highly regular with repeated modules and is very well suited for VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3652/00133165.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.133165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.133165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=133165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast VLSI adder architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Fixed-point arithmetic","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","integrated logic circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast adder","CMOS IC","VLSI adder architecture","bit-parallel addition","carry-free property","redundant arithmetic","parallel redundant-to-binary conversion","radix-2 redundant digit form","two's-complement binary form","parallel conversion scheme","high-speed conversion","sign-select operation","sign-select conversion adder","VLSI implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"A fast VLSI adder architecture","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4175506","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast VLSI adder architecture","sourcePdf":"00133165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033661S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"45","articleId":"133165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":133166,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

By virtue of being self-contained, having few input and output pins, and processing stack elements once each clock cycle, the system should be capable of high-speed decoding. For constraint length 21, rate 1/2 codes, and 3-b soft decision detection, it is found that a system containing approximately 25000 stack cells reduces errors in a 3-dB signal-to-noise level environment, corresponding to 7.8% hard decision error rate, by two orders of magnitude. Higher decoding gain is obtained at lower noise levels through the use of a relatively long constraint length. The constraint length is not limited by the architecture. Chip area estimates needed to obtain prescribed decoded error rates and average decoding rates are also described and indicate that an effective system is potentially achievable with current technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.133166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3652/00133166.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.133166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3652","startPage":"768","endPage":"775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-chip design of bit-error-correcting stack decoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=133166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-chip design of bit-error-correcting stack decoders","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4175507","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-chip design of bit-error-correcting stack decoders","sourcePdf":"00133166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053398S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"3","articleId":"133166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":133168,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The key circuit of the pulse sequence block is the ATD pulse generator circuit. The authors use a newly modified Schmitt trigger delay circuit. To reduce supply line noise in the chip, they needed to lower the peak of bit-line charge-up current. This was done by applying a divided word-line technique and a newly adopted staggered bit-line equalizing pulse technique.

A sample rate of 100 sps and a quantization level of 35 mu V are selected to minimize the mean-square-error distortion while maintaining a data rate that allows 24 h of two-channel ECG data to be stored in less than 4 MB of memory. With this method, sample rate, and quantization level, the ambulatory ECG is compressed and stored in real time with an average data rate of 174 b/s per channel. It is demonstrated that, for the low sample rate and coarse quantization required for ambulatory recording, without sufficient temporal resolution in beat location, beat subtraction does not significantly improve compression, and may even worsen compression performance. It is also shown that with average beat subtraction, compression is improved if multiple beat averages maintained. Improvement is most significant for ECG signals that exhibit frequent ectopic beats.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3971077","pubMedId":"2066138","displayDocTitle":"Compression of the ambulatory ECG by average beat subtraction and residual differencing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of the ambulatory ECG by average beat subtraction and residual differencing","sourcePdf":"00133206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034308S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"3654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"87","articleId":"133206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":133210,"authors":[{"name":"L.N.

The group method of data handling (GMDH) correction method reported previously by the authors (1984, 1986) can be adapted to a measurement environment in which kinesiographic signals are subject to ferromagnetic interferences, but it was restricted to kinesiographic signals representing lattice points in space. The sensitivity method for GMDH correction modeling is explored. This provides for nonlinear interpolation of kinesiographic signals for lattice points. Nominals, i.e., true values, of 3-D coordinates of the interlattice points were determined by means of a mandibular jaw movement simulator together with simultaneous recording of distorted kinesiographic signals which correspond to the nominals. Distorted signals were corrected by the new method of correction modeling. A mean estimation error of 0.16 mm (SD 0.19 mm) was determined for 24 interlattice coordinates. Thus, nonlinear interpolation by the sensitivity method is confirmed to be effective.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear interpolation of mandibular kinesiographic signals by applying sensitivity method to a GMDH correction model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.133225","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/3655/00133225.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.133225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=133225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear interpolation of mandibular kinesiographic signals by applying sensitivity method to a GMDH correction model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3971082","pubMedId":"1855792","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear interpolation of mandibular kinesiographic signals by applying sensitivity method to a GMDH correction model","sourcePdf":"00133225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040222S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"3655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"10","articleId":"133225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":133234,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The hard constraint, problem is equivalent to packing N points in an ellipsoid in min(K,N-1) dimensions to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance between pairs of points.

This analysis, although asymptotic in nature, helps to demonstrate the performance advantages of the VQ. Implementation issues of the VQ are discussed. Nonasymptotic results are considered. In particular, the author presents an approximate design algorithm for finite bit rate and demonstrates the usefulness of this VQ through several example designs with Monte Carlo simulations of performance.

The presence of the hard limiter in the algorithm makes a rigorous analysis difficult. Therefore, there are few results available. Such results normally include restrictive assumptions such as the assumptions that successive observation vectors are independent and the new error signal of the adaptive filter has a time invariant probability density function. The former assumption is not valid in the context of adaptive filtering since two successive observation vectors share most of their components, while the latter assumption is a restriction on the adaptive weights whose evolution is a priori unknown. In lieu of using these assumptions, an almost-sure convergence of the SA is proved under the assumption that the sequence of observation vectors is M-dependent.

It is assumed that the FS machine determines the fraction of the capital wagered at each time instance i on the outcome at the next time instance, i+1, and that wagers are paid at even odds. The maximal capital achieved by any FS machine is found and its dependence on an empirical entropy measure, H/sup FS/(x), defined as the finite state complexity of x, is shown. A specific gambling scheme is then proposed based on the Lempel-Ziv method for universal compression. The capital gained by this method is found and it is observed that, asymptotically, its exponential growth rate dominates the experimental growth rate achieved by gambling using any FS machine. Furthermore, this specific scheme suggests a class of gambling methods, based on a class of variable-to-variable length lossless compression methods, in which the capital is doubled for every bit compressed. These results emphasize the relation between gambling and data compression.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4033966","displayDocTitle":"Gambling using a finite state machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gambling using a finite state machine","sourcePdf":"00133269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031322S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","articleId":"133269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":133274,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In conventional metallic superconductors, the energy relaxation rate of electrons is used to determine the electron-phonon coupling constant lambda . The agreement between the lambda values measured and those obtained by other techniques is excellent, confirming the theoretical predictions of P.B. Allen (1987). A novel Cu overlayer technique was developed in order to measure certain metals which do not have a strong optical transition to states near the Fermi level at a laser energy, of 1.98 eV. The effect of different Cu overlayer thicknesses has been studied. In the new copper-oxide high-T/sub c/ superconducting materials, electronic energy relaxation is monitored by measuring changes epsilon /sub 2/. The observed changes in epsilon /sub 2/ are related to the dynamics of the Cu d to O p band charge transfer excitation occurring in the CuO/sub 2/ planes. By depleting a YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7- delta / sample of oxygen, one can simultaneously vary the Fermi level and the T/sub c/ and make dramatic changes in the pump-probe signal. An estimate of lambda , in several high-T/sub c/ materials, is also made using Allen's theory to fit the relaxation behavior of epsilon /sub 2/.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3657/00133480.pdf","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.133480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.133480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=133480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond thermomodulation studies of low and high-T/sub c/ superconductors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Ultrafast optics","Energy measurement","Ultrafast electronics","Superconductivity","Electrons","Optical pumping","Laser theory","Laser transitions","Superconducting materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["barium compounds","Fermi level","high-temperature superconductors","stoichiometry","thermo-optical effects","yttrium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high temperature superconductor","thermomodulation","femtosecond pump-probe measurements","electronic energy relaxation","metallic superconductors","Cu overlayer technique","strong optical transition","Fermi level","Cu d to O p band charge transfer excitation","CuO/sub 2/ planes","YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7- delta /"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond thermomodulation studies of low and high-T/sub c/ superconductors","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3948977","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond thermomodulation studies of low and high-T/sub c/ superconductors","sourcePdf":"00133480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055441S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"3657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","articleId":"133480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":133514,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A superconducting field rotor was constructed and mounted into the previous stator to form a fully superconducting machine. The rotating part is rather simple: a helium vessel rotates into a low-pressure vessel to avoid thermal losses by turbulence. There is no thermal shielding due to the cryogenic environment of the stator, and the electromagnetic shield, present in classical superconducting generators, has been avoided with the low loss superconductors used. The combined 900-mm-long, 320-mm-diameter, rotor-stator cryostat uses fiberglass composites in the central parts due to the rotating fields under permanent or transient operations.

With an artificial neural network scheme, Josephson devices will be expected to develop a new paradigm for future computer systems. Circuit configurations for a neuron with Josephson devices are described. A combination of a variable bias source and Josephson devices is proposed for a synapse circuit. The bias source signal is steered by the Josephson device input signal and becomes the synapse output signal. These output signals are summed up at the specific resistor or inductor to produce the weighted sum of Josephson devices input signals. According to the error signal, the bias source value is corrected. This corresponds to the learning procedure.

Unlike its predecessors, SPICE3 is written in the C programming language, and is designed for interactive use under a modern multitasking operating system. The Berkeley distribution of SPICE3 lacks support for Josephson junctions. As a consequence, the author has developed a customized version of SPICE3b.1 which incorporates a Josephson junction model. The model supports control current modulation, as well as fifth-order polynomial description of the quasiparticle current suitable for NbN junctions. In addition, a margin analysis command has been added, allowing operating ranges to be determined for an arbitrary circuit with a minimum of simulation. Further enhancements include the addition of a second graphics post-processor with new features and display, as well as debugging and streamlining of the original code. The program is currently configured to run on an IBM/Intel 386 compatible computer with Weitek coprocessor, under DOS extender software. The modifications to SPICE3 are described, and some of the issues involved in simulating Josephson circuits are also addressed. The features and philosophy of the SPICE3 program are discussed, and sample results presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/7960774/00133816.pdf","startPage":"2902","endPage":"2905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.133816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.133816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7960774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=133816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Josephson junctions in SPICE3","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Josephson junctions","Circuit simulation","Computational modeling","SPICE","Computer languages","Multitasking","Operating systems","Polynomials","Analytical models","Computer graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","digital simulation","electronic engineering computing","Josephson effect","superconducting junction devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Josephson circuit simulation","Josephson junctions","SPICE3","circuit simulator","C programming language","multitasking operating system","SPICE3b.1","junction model","control current modulation","fifth-order polynomial description","quasiparticle current","margin analysis command","graphics post-processor","debugging","IBM/Intel 386 compatible computer","Weitek coprocessor","DOS extender software","NbN junctions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/133816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Josephson junctions in SPICE3","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3960526","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Josephson junctions in SPICE3","sourcePdf":"00133816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022621S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"7960774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"71","articleId":"133816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":133821,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

The PECVD equipment yields a high deposition rate at moderate substrate temperatures. No degradation of the junction characteristics due to these depositions is seen. The measured loss tangent of this dielectric at 10 GHz using a parallel plate technique is 4.44*10/sup -4/. The dielectric constant of this material is 5.1 in the range of 50 to 400 GHz, measured using an on-chip resonator capacitively coupled to a single shunted Josephson junction. The physical quality of the oxide has been investigated using a variety of tests and has proven to be excellent.

The relation between variance of the multiplicative noise, characteristics of the nonlinear quantizer, and impulse response of the pulse shaping filters used in the modems is derived. Effects of multiplicative noise on the performance of QAM and TCM modems are analyzed. A method for the design of QAM and TCM signal constellations is introduced which counteracts the harmful effects of nonlinear quantizers.

The authors formulate the flow and wavelength assignment problem, when minimizing the maximum flow in the network, as a mixed integer optimization problem subject to linear constraints. The problem is decomposed into two independent subproblems, the wavelength assignment (or connectivity problem) and the flow assignment (or routing problem). A simple heuristic provides a meaningful formulation to the connectivity problem, in a form similar to a transportation problem. An algorithm is then proposed which finds a heuristic initial logical connectivity diagram and the corresponding routing, and then iterates from that solution by applying branch-exchange operations to the connectivity diagram. The algorithm was tested on illustrative traffic matrices for an 8 node network with two transmitters and two receivers per node, and an improvement in achievable throughput over the Perfect Shuffle interconnection pattern was shown in all cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.134012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3658/00134012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.134012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3658","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logically rearrangeable multihop lightwave networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Logically rearrangeable multihop lightwave networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4041267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logically rearrangeable multihop lightwave networks","sourcePdf":"00134012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12551S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"146","articleId":"134012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":134015,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The characteristics of the underwater channel relevant to spread-spectrum system design are discussed, and a channel model for short-range communications (less than 10 km) is defined. The receiver considered uses a digital coherent RAKE combiner, coupled with an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based estimator for channel parameters and pseudonoise code delay. Receiver performance is evaluated by computing average bit-error rate (BER) versus iterations of the EKF joint estimator, using both fixed and time-varying channels. It is shown that the BER obtained using the EKF joint estimator closely tracks the optimum BER obtained when the channel, delay, and Doppler parameters are known exactly. Finally, the Cramer-Rao lower bound for time-invariant joint channel, delay, and Doppler estimation is derived, and compared with the ensemble averaged mean-squared error of the EKF estimator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.134015","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3658/00134015.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.134015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital DS spread-spectrum receiver with joint channel and Doppler shift estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Doppler shift","Delay estimation","Bit error rate","Underwater acoustics","Mobile communication","Frequency","RAKE receivers","Fading","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio systems","Doppler effect","parameter estimation","radio receivers","signal processing","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","Doppler shift estimation","digital spread-spectrum receiver design","multipath channels","underwater channel","channel model","short-range communications","digital coherent RAKE combiner","extended Kalman filter","pseudonoise code delay","average bit-error rate","joint estimator","time-varying channels","Cramer-Rao lower bound","time-invariant joint channel","mean-squared error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"A digital DS spread-spectrum receiver with joint channel and Doppler shift estimation","volume":"39","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4041270","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134015/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital DS spread-spectrum receiver with joint channel and Doppler shift estimation","sourcePdf":"00134015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034672S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"80","articleId":"134015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":134040,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters.

The only explicit assumption made is that the intensity data can be modeled by a Gauss Markov random field (GMRF). The image is divided into a number of nonoverlapping regions and the GMRF parameters are computed from each of these regions. A simple clustering method is used to merge these regions. The parameters of the model estimated from the clustered segments are then used in two different schemes, one being all approximation to the maximum a posterior estimate of the labels and the other minimizing the percentage misclassification error. The proposed approach is contrasted with the algorithm of S. Lakshamanan and H. Derin (1989), which uses a simultaneous parameter estimation and segmentation scheme.

Using techniques similar to those developed by J. Canny (1983, 1986) and L.A. Spacek (1986), optimal filters are derived for ramp edges of various slopes. The optimal nonrecursive filter for ideal step edges is then derived as a limiting case of the filters for ramp edges. Because there are no step edges in images, edge detection is improved when the ramp filter is used instead of the filters developed for step edges.

Two retrieval algorithms that were previously developed for Landsat are modified for the AVHRR. The methods determine the aerosol optical thickness over land surfaces from AVHRR band one data independently of ancillary information. The first method retrieves aerosols based on the atmospheric effect on the path radiance. This method requires the surface reflectance to be 0.02+or-0.01, which is found over forests in the red channel. Two techniques are used to screen an AVHRR scene for pixels that have this low reflectance. The qualifying requirements for these techniques are discussed, and the method is demonstrated to retrieve aerosol optical thicknesses to approximately +or-0.1. The second method uses the change in contrast for several scenes to determine the change in the optical thickness between the scenes. A reference scene allows absolute determination. The method has an rms error of approximately 0.1.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aerosol retrieval over land from AVHRR data-application for atmospheric correction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.134072","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134072.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Aerosol retrieval over land from AVHRR data-application for atmospheric correction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180454","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aerosol retrieval over land from AVHRR data-application for atmospheric correction","sourcePdf":"00134072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046981S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"151","articleId":"134072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":134073,"authors":[{"name":"J.V.

A comparison of the angular shape of the retrieved functions is then used to establish whether the initial guess for the aerosol parameters was correct. Other than the need to define a relationship between the angular variation of the Fourier transform of the intrinsic surface angular reflectance at the zero and nonzero frequencies, the method assumes no prior knowledge about the aerosols or surface characteristics.

The same index can be used for remote sensing from Landsat TM and the EOS-HIRIS sensor. The index takes advantage of the presence of the blue channel (0.47.+or-0.01 mu m) in the MODIS sensor, in addition to the red (0.66+or-0.025 mu m) and the near-IR (0.865+or-0.02 mu m) channels that compose the present normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The resistance of the ARVI to atmospheric effects (in comparison to the NDVI) is accomplished by a self-correction process for the atmospheric effect on the red channel, using the difference in the radiance between the blue and the red channels to correct the radiance in the red channel. Simulations using radiative transfer computations on arithmetic and natural surface spectra, for various atmospheric conditions, show that ARVI has a similar dynamic range to the NDVI, but is, on average, four times less sensitive to atmospheric effects than the NDVI.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.134076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134076.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134076/","displayDocTitle":"Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS","volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180458","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS","sourcePdf":"00134076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041546S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"616","articleId":"134076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":134078,"authors":[{"name":"X.

An asymmetric hotspot, in which the shape of the hotspot is related to the shape of the plant crowns in the scene, is created. At large zenith angles illumination shadows will preferentially shadow the lower portions of adjacent crowns. Further, these shadows will be preferentially obscured since adjacent crowns will also tend to obscure the lower portions of other crowns. This effect produces a 'bowl-shaped' bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) in which the scene brightness increases at the function's edges. Formulas describing the hotspot and mutual-shadowing effects are derived, and examples that show how the shape of the BRDF is dependent on the shape of the crowns, their density, their brightness relative to the background, and the thickness of the layer throughout which the crown centers are distributed are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.134078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","startPage":"276","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance modeling of the discrete crown vegetation canopy: effect of crown shape and mutual shadowing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance modeling of the discrete crown vegetation canopy: effect of crown shape and mutual shadowing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180460","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance modeling of the discrete crown vegetation canopy: effect of crown shape and mutual shadowing","sourcePdf":"00134078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035597S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"565","articleId":"134078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":134082,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Both like- and cross-polarized scattering coefficients are obtained. The like-polarized scattering coefficients contain single scattering terms and multiple scattering terms. The single scattering terms are shown to reduce to the first-order solutions derived from the small perturbation method when the roughness parameters satisfy the slightly rough conditions. When surface roughnesses are large but the surface slope is small, only a single scattering term corresponding to the standard Kirchhoff model is significant. If the surface slope is large, the multiple scattering term will also be significant. The cross-polarized backscattering coefficients satisfy reciprocity and contain only multiple scattering terms. The difference between vertical and horizontal scattering coefficients increases with the dielectric constant and is generally smaller than that predicted by the first-order small perturbation model. Good agreements are obtained between this model and measurements from statistically known surfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.134085","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"356","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backscattering from a randomly rough dielectric surface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backscatter","Dielectrics","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Polarization","Scattering parameters","Magnetic fields","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM waves","randomly rough dielectric surface","backscattering model","scattering coefficients","single scattering","multiple scattering","small perturbation method","roughness parameters","surface slope","reciprocity","dielectric constant"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Backscattering from a randomly rough dielectric surface","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4180467","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134085/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backscattering from a randomly rough dielectric surface","sourcePdf":"00134085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035425S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"793","articleId":"134085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":134086,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Using a laser profiler and dielectric probes, a complete and accurate set of ground truth data was collected for each surface condition, from which accurate measurements were made of the rms height, correlation length, and dielectric constant. Based on knowledge of the scattering behavior in limiting cases and the experimental observations, an empirical model was developed for sigma degrees /sub hh/, sigma degrees /sub vv/, and sigma degrees /sub hv/ in terms of ks (where k=2 pi / lambda is the wave number and s is the rms height) and the relative dielectric constant of the soil surface. The model, which was found to yield very good agreement with the backscattering measurements of the present study as well as with measurements reported in other investigations, was used to develop an inversion technique for predicting the rms height of the surface and its moisture content from multipolarized radar observations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.134086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","startPage":"370","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical model and an inversion technique for radar scattering from bare soil surfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An empirical model and an inversion technique for radar scattering from bare soil surfaces","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180468","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical model and an inversion technique for radar scattering from bare soil surfaces","sourcePdf":"00134086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039982S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"863","articleId":"134086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":134088,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The frequency and angular responses of a two-scale cylinder cluster are calculated to demonstrate the significance of vegetation architecture. The results indicate that the architecture of vegetation plays an important role in determining the observed coherent effects. A two-scale branching model is implemented for soybean with its internal structure and the resulting clustering effects considered. At the scale of soybean fields, the relative location of soybean plants is described by a pair distribution function. The polarimetric backscattering coefficients are obtained in terms of the scattering properties of soybean plants and the pair distribution function. Theoretical backscattering coefficients evaluated using the hole-correction pair distribution are in good agreement with extensive data from soybean fields. The hole-correction approximation, which prevents two soybean plants from overlapping each other, is more realistic and improves the agreement between the model calculation and experimental data near normal incidence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134088.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.134088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Branching model for vegetation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical scattering","Rayleigh scattering","Backscatter","Vegetation mapping","Electromagnetic scattering","Distribution functions","Laboratories","Engine cylinders","Remote sensing","Geophysical measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ecology","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["branching model","remote sensing","angular responses","two-scale cylinder cluster","vegetation architecture","coherent effects","soybean","internal structure","fields","plants","pair distribution function","polarimetric backscattering coefficients","scattering properties","hole-correction pair distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Branching model for vegetation","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180470","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Branching model for vegetation","sourcePdf":"00134088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041402S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"101","articleId":"134088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":134089,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The dynamic range of the radar backscatter intensity from forest was found to be greatest at P-band and decreased with increasing frequencies. Cross-polarized backscatter intensity yielded the best sensitivities to variations of forest biomass. L-band data confirmed past results on good correlation with forest parameters.

Plantations of maritime pines near Landes, France, range in age from 8 to 46 years with above-ground biomass between 5 and 105 tons/ha. Loblolly pine stands established on abandoned agricultural fields near Duke, NC, range in age from 4 to 90 years and extend the range of above-ground biomass to 560 tons/ha for the older stands. These two experimental forests are largely complementary with respect to biomass. Radar backscatter is found to increase approximately linearly with increasing biomass until it saturates at a biomass level that depends on the radar frequency. The biomass saturation level is about 200 tons/ha at P-band and 100 tons/ha at L-band, and the C-band backscattering coefficient shows much less sensitivity to total above-ground biomass.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.134090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3662/00134090.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.134090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Dependence of radar backscatter on coniferous forest biomass","volume":"30","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4180472","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134090/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependence of radar backscatter on coniferous forest biomass","sourcePdf":"00134090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043762S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"465","articleId":"134090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":134196,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

In general, the performance of optical FM signal amplification by a laser amplifier is affected by the value of the injection power, by the performance of the injecting laser (the master laser), and by the difference between the emission frequencies of the master and slave optical cavities. In particular, when the modulation frequency is very low, the output frequency deviation (FD) of the laser amplifier turns out to coincide with that of the master laser.

One application of the network uses multiple functionally disjoint stages to provide pattern recognition that is invariant to translations of the object in the image plane. The general form of the network uses three stages that perform the functionally disjoint tasks of preprocessing, invariance, and recognition. The preprocessing stage is a single layer of processing elements that performs dynamic thresholding and intensity scaling. The invariance stage is a multilayered connectionist implementation of a modified Walsh-Hadamard transform used for generating an invariant representation of the image. The recognition stage is a multilayered self-organizing neural network that learns to recognize the representation of the input image generated by the invariance stage. The network can successfully self-organize to recognize objects without regard to the location of the object in the image field and has some resistance to noise and distortions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.134253","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.134253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3667","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/3667/00134253.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilayered self-organizing artificial neural network for invariant pattern recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134253/","displayDocTitle":"A multilayered self-organizing artificial neural network for invariant pattern recognition","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4176892","publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilayered self-organizing artificial neural network for invariant pattern recognition","sourcePdf":"00134253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047375S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"12","articleId":"134253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":134256,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Its mounting position and orientation must be identified, resulting in an extrinsic calibration problem. The author presents three classes of extrinsic calibration procedures. All use closed-form solutions. The class A calibration procedure requires a reference object at a recalibrated location. The class B calibration procedure takes advantage of robot mobility. It requires a reference frame, but not precalibration. The class C procedure, by taking full advantage of both robot mobility and dexterity, requires no reference object but the simplest one-a visible point. In simulation studies, the class A, B, and C calibration procedures have produced estimates successfully converging to true extrinsic parameter values. Results of field experiments carried out for class B and C calibration procedures are presented. For comparison, two existing B-type calibration methods have also been tested with real data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134271/","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4181817","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Extrinsic calibration of a vision sensor mounted on a robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extrinsic calibration of a vision sensor mounted on a robot","sourcePdf":"00134271.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039381S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"115","articleId":"134271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":134272,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.

With this system the authors have investigated the effect of time delay on human telemanipulation task performance. Time delays of between 2 and 4096 ms were introduced between master and slave arms, and high-precision peg-in-hole tasks were performed by six test operators with two modes of control: kinesthetic force feedback (KFF) and shared compliant control (SCC). Task performance was quantified in terms of the completion time (CT) and the sum of square forces (SOSF). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SCC over KFF for time-delayed telemanipulation. SCC has significantly lower rates of increase than KFF in both CT and SOSF with time delay. Only SCC enabled task performance at delays above 1 s. Constant force maintenance tasks were also performed to investigate the effect of time delay on the stability of force reflection. SCC also has beneficial effects on telemanipulation without time delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.134272","startPage":"176","endPage":"185","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3668/00134272.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.134272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force-reflection and shared compliant control in operating telemanipulators with time delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Delay effects","Control systems","Humans","Master-slave","Arm","Performance evaluation","Testing","Force feedback","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","force control","position control","robots","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["master-slave systems","force reflection control","shared compliant control","telemanipulators","time delay","peg-in-hole tasks","kinesthetic force feedback","completion time","sum of square forces","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Force-reflection and shared compliant control in operating telemanipulators with time delay","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4181818","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force-reflection and shared compliant control in operating telemanipulators with time delay","sourcePdf":"00134272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032942S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"252","articleId":"134272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":134273,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In analogy to the term early vision, the authors call the first level of processing required in tactile sensing early taction. The problem of deblurring or deconvolution of data provided by an array of tactile sensors that is also assumed to be corrupted by noise is addressed. It is noted that this inverse problem is ill posed and that the technique of regularization may be used to obtain solutions. The theory of nonlinear electrical networks is utilized to describe energy functions for a class of nonlinear networks and to show that the equilibrium states of the proposed network correspond to regularized solutions of the deblurring problem. An entropy regularizer is incorporated into the energy function of the network for the recovery of normal stress distributions.

Its computational efficiency and robustness against singularity are discussed. Two applications are examined. The first is determining the design coordinate system with respect to a machine coordinate system. The second is comparative analysis for precision measurement. For determining the design coordinate system, a sensitivity measure is proposed and confirmed experimentally. For error comparative analysis, a statistical model is developed to determine the minimum number of required measurement points so that the sampled points can closely represent the entire population.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.134279","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3668/00134279.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.134279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated precision measurement of surface profile in CAD-directed inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Automated precision measurement of surface profile in CAD-directed inspection","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4181825","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated precision measurement of surface profile in CAD-directed inspection","sourcePdf":"00134279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035168S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"151","articleId":"134279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":134285,"authors":[{"name":"C.-M.

This includes continuous and discrete formulations of unsupervised, supervised, and differential competitive learning systems. These systems estimate an unknown probability density function from random pattern samples and behave as adaptive vector quantizers. Synaptic vectors, in feedforward competitive neural networks, quantize the pattern space and converge to pattern class centroids or local probability maxima. A stochastic Lyapunov argument shows that competitive synaptic vectors converge to centroids exponentially quickly and reduces competitive learning to stochastic gradient descent. Convergence does not depend on a specific dynamical model of how neuronal activations change. These results extend to competitive estimation of local covariances and higher order statistics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Neurons","Learning systems","Probability density function","Multi-layer neural network","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Convergence","Higher order statistics","Fans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","probability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive learning","stochastic dynamical systems","probability density","adaptive vector quantizers","neural networks","pattern space","Lyapunov argument","competitive synaptic vectors","centroids"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.134289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/3669/00134289.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.134289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic competitive learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic competitive learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134289/","volume":"2","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4008278","pubMedId":"18282865","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic competitive learning","sourcePdf":"00134289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057103S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"3669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"64","articleId":"134289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":134290,"authors":[{"name":"C.-S.

Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift, the space grid in the propagation direction is reduced to half its normal size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.134342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/3671/00134342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.134342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3671","startPage":"165","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-wave analysis of guided wave structures using a novel 2-D FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Full-wave analysis of guided wave structures using a novel 2-D FDTD","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4192807","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-wave analysis of guided wave structures using a novel 2-D FDTD","sourcePdf":"00134342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047078S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"111","articleId":"134342","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":134353,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

When unbiased, the antenna operates in its usual fashion, with relatively large RCS peaks at frequencies corresponding to the resonances of the patch element. When the ferrite substrate is properly biased, the antenna element becomes effectively short-circuited, resulting in the elimination of the resonant behavior of the scattering response of the patch and in a reduction of 20-40 dB in its RCS. This mechanism allows the implementation of a microstrip antenna or array system that can be switched to an 'off' state, where it will be much less visible to an interrogating radar. Calculated results are obtained from a full-wave moment method solution for the RCS of a microstrip antenna on a normally biased ferrite substrate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/3671/00134353.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","doi":"10.1109/75.134353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.134353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RCS reduction for a microstrip antenna using a normally biased ferrite substrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Ferrites","Radar antennas","Radar cross section","Frequency","Resonance","Radar scattering","Microwave antennas","Microstrip antenna arrays","Magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferrite applications","microstrip antennas","radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave antennas","patch element resonance elimination","RCS reduction","microstrip antenna","normally biased ferrite substrate","radar cross section","cutoff state","scattering response","full-wave moment method solution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","displayDocTitle":"RCS reduction for a microstrip antenna using a normally biased ferrite substrate","volume":"2","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4192818","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RCS reduction for a microstrip antenna using a normally biased ferrite substrate","sourcePdf":"00134353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029385S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"58","articleId":"134353","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":134369,"authors":[{"name":"C.-T.

Moreover, the resulting 2D DCT architectures are modular, regular, and locally connected and require only two 1D DCT blocks that are extended directly from the 1D DCT structure without transposition. It is therefore suitable for VLSI implementation for high-speed HDTV systems. A parallel 2D DCT architecture and a scanning pattern for HDTV systems to achieve higher performance is proposed.

It is found that traffic periodicity can cause different sources with identical statistical characteristics to experience differing cell-loss rates. For a single-stage multiplexer model, some of this source-periodicity effect can be mitigated by appropriate buffer scheduling and one effective scheduling policy is presented. For the sequence analyzed, the number of cells per frame follows a gamma (or negative binomial) distribution. The number of cells per frame is a stationary stochastic process. For traffic studies, neither an autoregressive model of order two nor a two-state Markov chain model is good because they do not model correctly the occurrence of frames with a large number of cells, which are a primary factor in determining cell-loss rates. The order two autoregressive model, however, fits the data well in a statistical sense. A multistate Markov chain model that can be derived from three traffic parameters is sufficiently accurate for use in traffic studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","volume":"2","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4172900","publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis and simulation study of video teleconference traffic in ATM networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis and simulation study of video teleconference traffic in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00134371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044778S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"353","articleId":"134371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":134374,"authors":[{"name":"Ja-Ling Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ja-Ling Wu","id":"37279164700"},{"name":"Y.M.

BTFRs are first grouped into two basic domains, namely, the energy density domain (E-domain) with energetic interpretation, and the correlation domain (C-domain) with correlative interpretation. It is shown that these domains are related by a Fourier transform duality: to any BTFR, BTFR relation, or BTFR property of the E-domain, there corresponds a dual BTFR, BTFR relation, or BTFR properties of the C-domain, and vice versa. With this duality principle as a background, a classification of BTFRs is given. This classification is based on two dual shift-invariance properties and a self-dual scale-invariance property of BTFRs. The mathematical description of BTFRs by means of kernel functions is simplified, inside the respective BTFR classes. It is shown that BTFRs which are both shift and scale invariant can be represented as superpositions of generalized Wigner distributions (E-domain) or generalized ambiguity function (C-domain).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3996250","displayDocTitle":"Duality and classification of bilinear time-frequency signal representations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duality and classification of bilinear time-frequency signal representations","sourcePdf":"00134395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036408S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"134395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":134397,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated directions of arrival. The resolving power of the array is evaluated by analyzing the performance of a likelihood ratio detector designed to determine whether the signals observed by the array originate from a single source or from two closely spaced sources. Numerical examples and analysis of some special cases provide insights into the improvement in direction finding accuracy and in the resolving power of the array due to polarization diversity. The case of a signal in the presence of an interferer is studied in some detail. The CRB and the probability of detection are evaluated as functions of the spatial separation and the polarization difference between signal and interferer, signal-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-interference ratio. Performance comparisons are made between uniformly polarized and diversity polarized arrays. It is shown that improved direction finding performance can be obtained by using polarization diversity, with no increase in hardware complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3673/00134397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3673","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of diversely polarized antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of diversely polarized antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3996251","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of diversely polarized antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00134397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026691S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","articleId":"134397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":134399,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

A large number of candidate trajectories, organized into a tree structure, are hypothesized at each pixel in the sequence and tested sequentially for a shift in mean intensity. The practicality of the algorithm is facilitated by the use of multistage hypothesis testing (MHT) for simultaneous inference, as well as the existence of exact, closed-form expressions for MHT test performance in Gaussian white noise (GWN). These expressions predict the algorithm's computation and memory requirements, where it is shown theoretically that several orders of magnitude of processing are saved over a brute-force approach based on fixed sample-size tests. The algorithm is applied to real data by using a robust preprocessing procedure to eliminate background structure and transform the image sequence into a residual representation, modeled as GWN. Results are verified experimentally on a variety of video image sequences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1611","endPage":"1629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3673","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3673/00134399.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Image sequences","Testing","Inference algorithms","Multidimensional systems","Digital images","Tree data structures","Sequential analysis","Closed-form solution","White noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","picture processing","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving objects detection","picture processing","computation requirements","using sequential hypothesis testing","algorithm","multidimensional detection problems","position","velocity","digital images","trajectories","tree structure","mean intensity","multistage hypothesis testing","inference","Gaussian white noise","memory requirements","preprocessing procedure","residual representation","video image sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detecting small, moving objects in image sequences using sequential hypothesis testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134399/","volume":"39","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4008646","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting small, moving objects in image sequences using sequential hypothesis testing","sourcePdf":"00134399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039707S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"143","articleId":"134399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":134400,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

The authors describe how a wide range of probabilistic information pertaining to the noise process can be used in a general set theoretic estimation framework. The basic principle is to constrain the sample statistics of the estimation residual to be consistent with those probabilistic properties of the noise which are available and to construct sets accordingly in the solution space. Adding these sets to the collection of sets describing the solution will yield a smaller feasibility set and, hence, more reliable estimates. Pieces of information relative to quantities such as range, moments, absolute moments, and second and higher order probabilistic attributes are considered, and properties of the corresponding sets are established.

Speech recognition experiments show that for almost any reasonable amount of training data, recognizers using mixture HMMs consistently outperform those employing unimodal Gaussian HMMs. With a sufficiently large training set (e.g. more than 2500 words), use of HMMs with 25-component mixture distributions typically reduces recognition errors by about 40%. It is also found that the mixture HMMs outperform a set of unimodal generalized triphone models having the same number of parameters. Previous attempts to employ mixture HMMs for speech recognition proved discouraging because of the high complexity and computational cost in implementing the Baum-Welch training algorithm. It is shown how mixture HMMs can be implemented very simply in unimodal transition-based frameworks by allowing multiple transitions from one state to another.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3673/00134406.pdf","startPage":"1677","endPage":"1681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phonemic hidden Markov models with continuous mixture output densities for large vocabulary word recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134406/","displayDocTitle":"Phonemic hidden Markov models with continuous mixture output densities for large vocabulary word recognition","volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4008653","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phonemic hidden Markov models with continuous mixture output densities for large vocabulary word recognition","sourcePdf":"00134406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03741S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"134406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":134411,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Distinguishing different objectives for heavy and light noise interference, two related algorithms are developed. For speech degraded by heavy noise, the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is as high as 12 dB; for lightly noisy speech, the improvement is modest and decreases as the SNR of the noisy speech increases. Quantizing noise is used to assess the capacity for reducing nonstationary noise using these algorithms; a significant reduction of such noise and an improvement in speech quality are achieved. The advantages of the proposed algorithms for speech enhancement include no need for prior knowledge of the noise and only a modest computational requirement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Signal to noise ratio","Noise reduction","Noise level","Noise cancellation","Degradation","Military computing","Military aircraft","Signal processing","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","speech analysis and processing","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stationary additive white noise","quantising noise","auditory evidence","nonstationary additive white noise","light noise interference","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","noisy speech","speech quality","speech enhancement"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134427","startPage":"1943","endPage":"1954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3674/00134427.pdf","doi":"10.1109/78.134427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement based conceptually on auditory evidence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement based conceptually on auditory evidence","accessionNumber":"4028736","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","volume":"39","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement based conceptually on auditory evidence","sourcePdf":"00134427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027482S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"58","articleId":"134427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":134429,"authors":[{"name":"B.D. van Veen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"B.D.","lastName":"van Veen","id":"37273441600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"134429","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference constraints","Nonlinear distortion","Interference cancellation","White noise","Spectral shape","Distortion measurement","Signal generators","Speech","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array processing","soft response constraints","beamformer response","minimum variance beamforming","quadratic constraint","mean-squared error","signal direction","interference cancellation","spectral shape","mean-square distortion"]}],"abstract":"Soft constraints on the beamformer response to the signal are examined in the context of minimum variance beamforming.

Under the assumptions of known signal direction and spectral shape the signal-to-noise ratio is shown to be a nondecreasing function of the mean-square distortion.

For first-order sampling, the acceptable and unacceptable sample rates are presented, with specific discussion of the practical rates which are nonminimum. It is shown that the minimum sampling rate is pathological in that any imperfection in the implementation will cause aliasing. In applying bandpass sampling to relocate signals to a base-band position, the signal-to-noise ratio is not preserved owing to the out-of-band noise being aliased. The degradation in signal-to-noise ratio is quantified in terms of the position of the bandpass signal. For the construction of a bandpass signal from second-order samples, the cost of implementing the interpolant (dynamic range and length) depends on Kohlenberg's sampling factor (1953) k, the relative delay between the uniform sampling streams. An elaboration on the disallowed discrete values of k shows that some allowed values are better than others for implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134430","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1984","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3674/00134430.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The theory of bandpass sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"The theory of bandpass sampling","volume":"39","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4028739","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The theory of bandpass sampling","sourcePdf":"00134430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050703S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"549","articleId":"134430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":134432,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The bistatic SAR inversion is also utilized to formulate an inversion for multistatic measurements made along a physical linear array due to a single transmission to image a dynamic object.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3674/00134436.pdf","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bistatic synthetic aperture radar inversion with application in dynamic object imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134436/","displayDocTitle":"Bistatic synthetic aperture radar inversion with application in dynamic object imaging","volume":"39","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4028745","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bistatic synthetic aperture radar inversion with application in dynamic object imaging","sourcePdf":"00134436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023932S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"155","articleId":"134436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":134437,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This architecture is based on the concept of content-addressable memory (CAM), where the data is accessed simultaneously and in parallel on the basis of its content. VQ essentially involves, for each input vector, a search operation to obtain the best match codeword. A speedup results if a CAM-based implementation is used. This speedup, coupled with the gains in execution time for the basic distortion operation, implies that even codebook generation is possible in real time (<32 ms). In using the CAM, the conventional mean square error measure is replaced by the absolute difference measure. This measure results in little degradation and in fact limits large errors. The regular and iterable architecture is particularly well suited for VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3674/00134438.pdf","doi":"10.1109/78.134438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134438","startPage":"2066","endPage":"2078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A content-addressable memory architecture for image coding using vector quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134438/","displayDocTitle":"A content-addressable memory architecture for image coding using vector quantization","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4028747","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A content-addressable memory architecture for image coding using vector quantization","sourcePdf":"00134438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035957S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","articleId":"134438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":134446,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The internal structure is based on planar rotators, ensuring reliable numerical behaviour and high processing rates in CORDIC environments. A simple update law allows a simpler implementation than previously proposed designs. Rather than minimizing an output error cost function, the algorithm is designed to achieve a stable associated differential equation, resulting in a globally convergent unbiased frequency estimator in the single sinusoid case, independent of the notch filter bandwidth. Using a second-order structure in the multiple sinusoid case, unbiased estimation of one of the input frequencies is achieved by thinning the notch bandwidth. The tracking behavior is superior to conventional output error designs, and the estimation of extremal frequencies is less prone to overflow instability than previously reported structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","volume":"39","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4036879","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An improved lattice-based adaptive IIR notch filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved lattice-based adaptive IIR notch filter","sourcePdf":"00134453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033793S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"235","articleId":"134453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":134455,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

A series of experiments over all Mandarin syllables (about 1300) is demonstrated in the speaker-dependent mode. Comparisons with the decoder timer waveform algorithm are evaluated to show that the performance is satisfactory. An overall recognition rate of 90.14% is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134458","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3674/00134458.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical neural network model based on a C/V segmentation algorithm for isolated Mandarin speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134458/","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical neural network model based on a C/V segmentation algorithm for isolated Mandarin speech recognition","volume":"39","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4036884","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical neural network model based on a C/V segmentation algorithm for isolated Mandarin speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00134458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039227S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","articleId":"134458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":134460,"authors":[{"name":"Ja-Ling Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ja-Ling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279164700"},{"name":"Yuh-Ming Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Ming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37349903700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"134460","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Symmetric matrices","Equations","Jacobian matrices","Multidimensional signal processing","Matrix decomposition","Speech processing","Polynomials","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Butler matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPT algorithm","modularized structure","two-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms","architecture"]}],"abstract":"The fast polynomial transform (FPT) for computing two-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms is modularized into identical modules.

This adjusts the outputs of a number of secondary sources to minimize a cost function comprising a combination of the sum of mean-square signals from a number of error sensors (the control error) and the sum of the mean-square signals fed to the secondary sources (the control effect). A steepest descent algorithm which performs this function is derived and analyzed. It is shown that some modes not only converge slowly but also require an excessive control effort for complete convergence. This ill-conditioned behavior can be controlled by the proper choice of the cost function minimized. Laboratory experiments using a 16-loudspeaker 32-microphone control system to control the harmonic sound in an enclosure are presented. The behavior of the practical system is accurately predicted from the theoretical analysis of the adaptive algorithm. The effect of errors in the assumed transfer matrix used by the steepest descent algorithm is briefly discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.134467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3675/00134467.pdf","startPage":"1041","endPage":"1052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.134467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The behavior of a multiple channel active control system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134467/","displayDocTitle":"The behavior of a multiple channel active control system","volume":"40","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4177262","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The behavior of a multiple channel active control system","sourcePdf":"00134467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056847S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"105","articleId":"134467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":134468,"authors":[{"name":"J.-J.

In sensor array processing, this amounts to assuming that the noise field is locally correlated spatially. Since spatial stationarity of the noise is not necessary, it also applies, for instance, to white noise with different power along the array.

It is shown that when minimum noise variance at the filter output is required, the optimization problem leads to set of familiar Wiener-Hopf or Yule-Walker equations, demonstrating that the optimal error feedback can be interpreted as a special case of Wiener filtering. As an alternative to the optimal solution, the formulas for suboptimal error feedback with symmetric or antisymmetric coefficients are derived. In addition, the design of error feedback using power-of-two coefficients is discussed. The efficiency of high order error feedback is examined by test implementations of the set of standard filters. It is concluded that error feedback is a very powerful and versatile method for cutting down the quantization noise in any classical infinite impulse response (IIR) filter implemented as a cascade of second-order direct form sections.

Compared to other approaches, the authors' derivation is simpler and unified, and may be useful to readers for better understanding the algorithms and their relationships. Moreover, it enables improvements of some algorithms in the literature in both the computational and the numerical issues. All algorithms derived in this work are based on Givens rotations. They offer superior numerical properties as shown by computer simulations. They are computationally efficient and highly concurrent.

The authors give an algorithm for the computation of the running order statistic. A highly parallel architecture suitable for VLSI implementation is presented. The architecture is very versatile, with programmable window size and rank order. An expansion algorithm and its VLSI architecture, which permit the usage of two r-bit OSFs to implement an (r+1)-bit OSF, where r is the resolution of the input signal samples, are given. In a special case where one is satisfied with at most one LSB error, the hardware complexity of the proposed architecture can be reduced by almost one half. It is further shown how a VLSI chip incorporating the proposed architecture can be used as the basic building block in the real-time implementation of other forms of nonlinear filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4182165","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"On the VLSI implementation of real-time order statistic filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the VLSI implementation of real-time order statistic filters","sourcePdf":"00134486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030448S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"134486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":134493,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Each physical channel is associated with several small queues, virtual channels, rather than a single deep queue. The virtual channels associated with one physical channel are allocated independently but compete with each other for physical bandwidth. Virtual channels decouple buffer resources from transmission resources. This decoupling allows active messages to pass blocked messages using network bandwidth that would otherwise be left idle. Simulation studies show that, given a fixed amount of buffer storage per link, virtual-channel flow control increases throughput by a factor of 3.5, approaching the capacity of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1990.134508","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

A description is given of the rationale, architecture, and implementation for the iWarp communication system. Memory communication is flexible and well suited for general computing, whereas systolic communication is efficient and well suited for speed-critical applications. The iWarp design is made possible by two important innovations in communication: (1) program access to communication and (2) logical channels. The former allows programs to access data as they are transmitted and to redirect portions of messages to different destinations efficiently. The latter increases the connectivity between the processors and guarantees communication bandwidth for classes of messages. These innovations have provided a focus for the iWarp architecture. The result is a communication system that provides a total bandwidth of 320 MBytes/sec and that is integrated on a single VLSI component with a 20 MFLOPS plus 20 MIPS long instruction work computation engine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1990.134510","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

However, the proposed mechanisms are complex and introduce new mapping complications. A greatly simplified approach to data-flow execution, called the explicit token store (ETS) architecture, and its current realization in Monsoon are presented. The essence of dynamic data-flow execution is captured by a simple transition on state bits associated with storage local to a processor. Low-level storage management is performed by the compiler in assigning nodes to slots in an activation frame, rather than dynamically in hardware. The processor is simple, highly pipelined, and quite general. It may be viewed as a generalization of a fairly primitive von Neumann architecture. Although the addressing capability is restrictive, there is exactly one instruction executed for each action on the data-flow graph. Thus, the machine-originated ETS model provides new understanding of the merits and the real cost of direct execution of data-flow graphs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

Both directory methods are modifications of a scheme proposed by L.M. Censier and P. Feautrier (1978) that does not rely on a specific interconnection network and can be readily distributed across interleaved main memory. The schemes considered here overcome the large amount of memory required for tags in the original scheme in two different ways. In the first scheme each main memory block is sectored into sub-blocks for which the large tag overhead is shared. In the second scheme a limited number of large tags are stored in an associative cache and shared among a much larger number of main memory blocks. Simulations show that in terms of access time and network traffic both directory methods provide significant performance improvements over a memory system in which shared-writable data are not cached. The large block sizes required for the sectored scheme, however, promote sufficient false sharing for its performance to be markedly worse than when a tag cache is used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical evaluation of two memory-efficient directory methods","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

A key feature of DASH is its distributed direction-based cache coherence protocol. Unlike traditional snoopy coherence protocols, the DASH protocol does not rely on broadcast; instead it uses point-to-point messages sent between the processors and memories to keep caches consistent. Furthermore, the DASH system does not contain any single serialization or control point. While these features provide the basis for scalability, they also force a reevaluation of many fundamental issues involved in the design of a protocol. These include the issues of correctness, performance, and protocol complexity. The design of the DASH coherence protocol is presented and discussed from the viewpoint of how it addresses the above issues. Also discussed is a strategy for verifying the correctness of the protocol.

It has been previously noted that, given a simple fetch strategy, the performance optimal block size is almost always four or eight words. If there is even a small cycle time penalty associated with either longer blocks or fetches, then the performance optimal size is noticeably reduced. In split cache organizations, where the fetch and block sizes of instruction and data caches are all independent design variables, instruction cache block size and fetch size should be the same. For the workload and write-back write policy used in this trace-driven simulation study, the instruction cache block size should be about a factor of 2 greater than the data cache fetch size, which in turn should be equal to or double the data cache block size. The simplest fetch strategy of fetching only on a miss and stalling the CPU until the fetch is complete works well. Complicated fetch strategies do not produce the performance improvements indicated by the accompanying reductions in miss ratios because of limited memory resources and a strong temporal clustering of cache misses. For the environments simulated, the most effective fetch strategy improved performance by between 1.7% and 4.5% over the simplest strategy described above.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

Accurate performance data for large second-level caches can be obtained by on-the-fly analysis of the traces. A comparison is made of the performance of systems with 512 K to 16 M second-level caches, and it is show that, for today's large programs, second-level caches of more than 4 MB may be unnecessary. It is also shown that set associativity in second-level caches of more than 1 MB does not significantly improve system performance.

Specifically, they examine how to choose the striping unit, that is, the amount of logically contiguous data on each disk. Rules for determining the best striping unit for a given range of workloads are synthesized. It is shown how the choice of striping unit depends on only two parameters: (1) the number of outstanding requests in the disk system at any given time, and (2) the average positioning time*data transfer rate of the disks. The authors derive an equation for the optimal striping unit as a function of these two parameters; they also show how to choose the striping unit without prior knowledge about the workload.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1990.134542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3676","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

Miss caching places a small, fully associative cache between a cache and its refill path. Misses in the cache that hit in the miss cache have only a 1-cycle miss penalty. Small miss caches of 2 to 5 entries are shown to be very effective in removing mapping conflict misses in first-level direct-mapped caches. Victim caching is an improvement to miss caching in that it loads the small fully associative cache with the victim of a miss and not the requested line. Small victim caches of 1 to 5 entries are even more effective at removing conflict misses than miss caching. Stream buffers prefetch cache lines starting at a cache miss address. The prefetched data are placed in the buffer and not in the cache. Stream buffers are useful in removing capacity and compulsory cache misses, as well as some instruction cache conflict misses. An extension to the basic stream buffer, called a multiway stream buffer, is introduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1990.134547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1990.134547","endPage":"373","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

However, it is found that the introduction of the nonuniformity in the grid gives rise to at least two difficulties in the implementation of the finite-difference time-domain algorithm. The first is the loss of accuracy in the computation of finite-difference derivatives when the field points are distributed nonuniformly. The second is implementation of the appropriate boundary conditions at the material interfaces. The authors address these problems and suggest some means for eradicating them. A scheme is presented that has the attractive feature that it reduces to the conventional finite-difference time-domain method if a uniform grid is used. To illustrate the proposed algorithm the authors consider a parallel plate waveguide which supports a single propagating mode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1989.134605","publicationTitle":"Digest on Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest on Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/798/3678/00134605.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"41 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1989.134605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of conformal grids for propagation and scattering problems in finite-difference time-domain computations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134605/","displayDocTitle":"On the use of conformal grids for propagation and scattering problems in finite-difference time-domain computations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3568171","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of conformal grids for propagation and scattering problems in finite-difference time-domain computations","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00134605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035283S","chronDate":"26-30 June 1989","isNumber":"3678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"798","citationCount":"3","articleId":"134605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":134608,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

However, for many real materials of interest these parameters vary significantly with frequency. The effects of constitutive parameters which vary with frequency are included in a frequency dependent FDTD formulation, (FD)/sup 2/TD, by extending the traditional Yee formulation to include discrete time-domain convolution. To apply (FD)/sup 2/TD all of the frequency domain information (in the complex permittivity function) is Fourier-transformed to a time-domain susceptibility function. To demonstrate (FD)/sup 2/TD computation of wideband reflections at an air-water interface the authors consider a one-dimensional problem space consisting of 1000 cells: 499 cells were used to model free space (air) and 501 cells were used for water. They compare (FD)/sup 2/TD results after 1200 time steps and FDTD results (with 20-GHz permittivity and conductivity values constant) after 8000 time steps with the exact analytical frequency domain result. The (FD)/sup 2/TD formulation is clearly much more accurate than traditional FDTD.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest on Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/798/3678/00134608.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"53 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Digest on Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.1989.134608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1989.134608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3678","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=134608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD formulation for frequency dependent permittivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Frequency dependence","Permittivity","Conductivity","Frequency domain analysis","Permeability","Conducting materials","Convolution","Computer interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["difference equations","permittivity","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD formulations","SHF","Fourier transform","frequency dependent permittivity","finite-difference time-domain","permeability","conductivity","discrete time-domain convolution","complex permittivity function","time-domain susceptibility function","wideband reflections","air-water interface","one-dimensional problem space","20 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/134608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"FDTD formulation for frequency dependent permittivity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3568174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD formulation for frequency dependent permittivity","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00134608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077259S","chronDate":"26-30 June 1989","isNumber":"3678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"798","citationCount":"4","articleId":"134608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":134609,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Since an array with quantized amplitudes may produce high sidelobes, the goal of this study was to use statistical thinning to smooth the average amplitude illumination and reduce peak sidelobe levels. The resulting changes in average sidelobe level, gain, and effective isotropic radiated power due to this design procedure were then evaluated.

The theory is based on a generalized method of solution of the FEL Helmholtz equation in the high-gain small-signal regime. The method consists basically of expanding the optical field in terms of Hermite-Gaussian modes, taken at the entrance to the undulator. The coefficients of that expansion are expressed in the form of a superposition of plane waves with complex frequencies. As a result, one gets a set of recursive relations, partly reproducing those obtained within the context of the single-mode evolution and partly displaying the effect (revealed by a coupling among the modes) of both the diffraction and the interaction with the e-beam.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.135208","startPage":"901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/3682/00135208.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.135208","endPage":"907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional analysis of an FEL amplifier operating with a continuous e beam","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional analysis of an FEL amplifier operating with a continuous e beam","volume":"28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4170964","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional analysis of an FEL amplifier operating with a continuous e beam","sourcePdf":"00135208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047463S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"4","articleId":"135208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":135209,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

This formalism is used to describe the carrier and power dynamics in semiconductor lasers above and below threshold in the static and transient regimes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4205338","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The gain and carrier density in semiconductor lasers under steady-state and transient conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The gain and carrier density in semiconductor lasers under steady-state and transient conditions","sourcePdf":"00135300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06609S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"17","articleId":"135300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135308,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

RPM has this pre-access feature integrated into its circuit design in order to minimize access time and increase organizational flexibility. A technique for implementing RPMs of practical size is described, and the characteristics of the memory are examined. Integrating its pre-access function in a CMOS SRAM results in no significant access time penalty, and an area cost of 2% to 8%, depending on the memory organization and size. This architecture is well suited to integrated memory whose requirements necessitate unaligned, multiword access with minimal delay penalty and no power-of-two access restrictions. In particular, such memory finds application in the instruction caches of high-performance superscalar processors, since these require multiple instruction prefetches in a single cycle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.135334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.135334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3685/00135334.pdf","startPage":"901","endPage":"907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"An integrated pre-access architecture for CMOS SRAM","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4195986","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated pre-access architecture for CMOS SRAM","sourcePdf":"00135334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035196S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1","articleId":"135334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135335,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

This is accomplished by means of control of the excitation or emission process or by feedback, using a copy of the photon point processes when the emissions occur in parts. Possible advantages of communication by photon-number-squeezed light are discussed. For receivers in which the photon arrival times are observed, the channel capacity cannot be improved by modifying an initially Poisson photon stream and making it sub-Poisson. For photon-counting receivers, however, improvement of the channel capacity is possible. The bit-error-rate of an on-off keying communication system using sub-Poisson photons created by introducing anticorrelation into an initially Poisson beam may or may not be smaller than the error rates of the Poisson channel, depending on where the maximum power constraint is placed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.135360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3686","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/3686/00135360.pdf","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information transmission with photon-number-squeezed light","doi":"10.1109/5.135360","startPage":"451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135360","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Information transmission with photon-number-squeezed light","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135360/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4163916","publicationDate":"March 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"80","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information transmission with photon-number-squeezed light","sourcePdf":"00135360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063159S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"14","articleId":"135360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":135372,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.F.

Experimental results measured for a 50-W convertor above the resonance at different load resistances and input voltages show excellent agreement with the theoretical performance predicted by the equations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.135431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.135431","startPage":"35","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/3689/00135431.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of parallel resonant convertor at high Q/sub L/","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of parallel resonant convertor at high Q/sub L/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4185268","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135431/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of parallel resonant convertor at high Q/sub L/","sourcePdf":"00135431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036338S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"34","articleId":"135431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":135435,"authors":[{"name":"Yeon Fuh Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yeon Fuh Jiang","id":"37087295510"},{"name":"Yu Ping Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu Ping Lin","id":"37087295375"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"135435","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1081},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error estimation of INS ground alignment through observability analysis","abstract":"A systematic analysis of the observability of an inertial navigation system (INS) in ground alignment with Bar-Itzhack and Berman's error model is presented.

It is shown that conventional CFAR procedures, which compensate only for alpha , degrade intolerably as beta deviates from beta =2, namely, as the Rayleigh distributional assumption is violated. A biparametric CFAR procedure is shown to be suited to such situations. The authors introduce a logarithmic transformation to reduce the Weibull probability density function (pdf) to a Gumbel pdf, i.e., to the location-scale type, and then exploit the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) of location-scale parameters to adjust the detection threshold. True CFAR is thus achieved when the clutter is locally homogeneous. Resilience against local inhomogeneities can also be conferred since BLUE lends itself to censoring. Through a performance analysis, the influence of various system and distributional parameters is elicited.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.135440","startPage":"138","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/3689/00135440.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.135440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biparametric linear estimation for CFAR against Weibull clutter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Degradation","Probability density function","Testing","Shape","Resilience","Statistical distributions","Maintenance engineering","Reliability engineering","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","probability","radar clutter","signal detection","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biparametric linear estimation","radar clutter","signal processing","Weibull clutter","constant false alarm rate","nonstationary clutter","Weibull distributed process","scale parameter","shape parameter","Rayleigh distributional assumption","biparametric CFAR","logarithmic transformation","Weibull probability density function","Gumbel","best linear unbiased estimation","location-scale parameters","detection threshold","local inhomogeneities","censoring","performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Biparametric linear estimation for CFAR against Weibull clutter","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4185277","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biparametric linear estimation for CFAR against Weibull clutter","sourcePdf":"00135440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030457S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"48","articleId":"135440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":135445,"authors":[{"name":"S.Z.

This algorithm is a simple modification of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) detector (or test) for detecting a signal in zero mean Gaussian noise with unknown correlation matrix. Specifically, the adaptive detection algorithm is obtained by introducing an arbitrary positive scalar, which is called the sensitivity parameter, into the GLR detector as a multiplier of an already existing quadratic term. The GLR detector then becomes a special case of this detector for the unity sensitivity parameter. It is shown that the sensitivity parameter controls the degree to which unwanted signals are rejected. From numerical examples, it is demonstrated how the sensitivity parameter can be chosen such that unwanted signals, can be rejected while maintaining acceptable detection loss for slightly mismatched signals.

The authors propose that the entire weight calculation (both QR decomposition, previously discussed by W.M. Gentleman and H.T.

This has the highly desirable property of graceful degradation: the loss of one or more component processors does not cause the computed weights to degrade catastrophically. The loss of a processor in the systolic array merely reduces the number of available degrees of freedom. Moreover, the processing array does not need to be globally reconfigured; the functions of all the remaining processors are unaffected and their interconnections are undisturbed. The authors describe the processing flow in the systolic array, show how its degradation is inherently graceful, and present a realistic example of graceful degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.135455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/3689/00135455.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.135455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"305","endPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graceful degradation of an adaptive beamforming processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"Graceful degradation of an adaptive beamforming processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135455/","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4190831","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graceful degradation of an adaptive beamforming processor","sourcePdf":"00135455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033829S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","articleId":"135455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":135467,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

In this algorithm, the sources are separated by using an adaptive beamformer whose outputs are processed by using the LMS algorithm to track distinct sources individually. From the LMS weights used, the source locations can be estimated. Whenever significant changes in these are detected, the beamformer is updated so that its outputs will be due to different sources in the steady state. With this algorithm, the problems of look-direction errors in look-direction constrained arrays and of large signal power in power inversion arrays are eliminated, and the enhancement of multiple moving sources becomes a natural process. Furthermore, because the sources are individually tracked and the beamformer is only updated occasionally, the algorithm possesses fast tracking behavior, and its implementation complexity is comparable to that of beamformer-based adaptive arrays using the LMS algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive algorithm","Adaptive arrays","Least squares approximation","Signal processing","Radar tracking","Interference constraints","Interference cancellation","Filtering algorithms","Phased arrays","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","interference suppression","signal processing","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array processing","adaptive algorithm","multiple directional sources","linear arrays","tracking","adaptive beamformer","LMS algorithm","source locations","look-direction errors","look-direction constrained arrays","power inversion arrays","multiple moving sources"]}],"doi":"10.1109/8.135467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3690/00135467.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.135467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive algorithm for separating and tracking multiple directional sources in linear arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive algorithm for separating and tracking multiple directional sources in linear arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135467/","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4195998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive algorithm for separating and tracking multiple directional sources in linear arrays","sourcePdf":"00135467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088504S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","articleId":"135467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":135471,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

Efficient algorithms are derived for the implementation of these constraints. In contrast to conventional derivative constraint methods which constrain both the magnitude (power) and phase responses of the beamformer, the method only constrains the magnitude response. The unnecessary constraint on the phase is a major drawback to the conventional methods since it causes the beamformer performance to vary with the particular spatial reference point used to define the array element positions. This phenomenon is clearly undesirable because the choice of a reference point is generally made for notational convenience. As a direct sequence of the phase constraint, an inappropriately chosen reference point can easily result in a beamformer response which has undesirably high sidelobes. The problem is avoided through the use of phase-independent derivative constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1992","volume":"40","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4196002","publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimum variance beamforming with phase-independent derivative constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum variance beamforming with phase-independent derivative constraints","sourcePdf":"00135471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049801S","chronDate":"Mar 1992","isNumber":"3690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"50","articleId":"135471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":135473,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

The adjustment of settings is required to respond to a rapid time-varying environment.

The master problem is easily solved by a one-dimensional gradient method, and the slave problem is solved by a parallel computing method which combines recursive quadratic programming with the dual method.

The sensor uses an absorptive indicator compound with a long wavelength absorption peak near 625 nm; change in absorption over the pH range 6.8 to 7.8 is reasonably linear. The sensor is interrogated by a pulsed, red LED. The return light signal is split into short- and long-wavelength components with a dichroic mirror; the respective signals are detected by photodiodes, and their photocurrents are used to form a radiometric output signal. In laboratory tests, the sensor system provided resolution of 0.01 pH, accuracy of +or-0.01 pH, and response time of 30-40 s. Following gamma sterilization, laboratory sensor testing with heparinized human blood yielded excellent agreement with a clinical blood gas analyzer. Excellent sensor performance and low cost, solid-state instrumentation are hallmarks of this sensor-system design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.135548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.135548","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/3692/00135548.pdf","startPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a medical fiber-optic pH sensor based on optical absorption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135548/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a medical fiber-optic pH sensor based on optical absorption","volume":"39","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4175546","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"1526644","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a medical fiber-optic pH sensor based on optical absorption","sourcePdf":"00135548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058256S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"46","articleId":"135548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135553,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The pertinent equations for determining the excitation electric field along the cable are summarized, along with the expressions which relate the line current to the excitation field. For the transmission line case, the cable current can be expressed in terms of per-unit-length impedance and admittance parameters which are functions of only the line geometry and the frequency. For the scattering case, similar line parameters can be inferred from the form of the solution for the current, but with the line parameters depending on the angles of incidence.

Based on this theorem, constructions are given for four classes of binary constant-weight codes. The first two classes are shown to achieve the Johnson upper bound on minimum distance asymptotically for long block lengths. The other two classes are shown similarly to meet asymptotically the low-rate Plotkin upper bound on minimum distance. A simple method is given for selecting virtually the maximum number of cyclically distinct codewords with full cyclic order from Reed-Solomon codes and from Berlekamp-Justesen maximum-distance-separable codes. Two correspondingly optimum classes of constant-weight cyclically permutable codes are constructed. It is shown that cyclically permutable codes provide a natural solution to the problem of constructing protocol-sequence sets for the M-active-out-of-T-users collision channel without feedback.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","volume":"38","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4226458","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constructions of binary constant-weight cyclic codes and cyclically permutable codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructions of binary constant-weight cyclic codes and cyclically permutable codes","sourcePdf":"00135636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024101S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"131","articleId":"135636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135637,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

It is shown that if the outer code is a suitably chosen constacyclic code the overall concatenated code is always cyclic regardless of the length of the outer code. Moreover, it follows that any cyclic code of composite length is a direct sum of cyclic concatenated codes with inner cyclic minimal codes and outer constacyclic codes. This description of cyclic codes of composite length leads to the introduction of the concept of a poor-code length (PCL). All but low-rate codes of this length have a poor minimum distance. A PCL is directly related to the existence of irreducible binomials. In the binary case, the first few PCLs are 9, 25, 27, 45, 49, 75, 81 and 99. Arbitrarily long binary cyclic codes that are better than binary BCH codes of primitive length are constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.135637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3697/00135637.pdf","startPage":"950","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.135637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic concatenated codes with constacyclic outer codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic concatenated codes with constacyclic outer codes","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4226459","volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic concatenated codes with constacyclic outer codes","sourcePdf":"00135637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041411S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","articleId":"135637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135638,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A BCH code with designed distance delta is denoted B(n, delta ). A BCH code is always a narrow-sense BCH code. A codeword is identified with its locator polynomial, whose coefficients are the symmetric functions of the locators. The definition of the code by its zeros-set involves some properties for the power sums of the locators. Moreover, the symmetric functions and the power sums of the locators are related to Newton's identities. An algebraic point of view is presented in order to prove or disprove the existence of words of a given weight in a code. The principal result is the true minimum distance of some BCH codes of length 255 and 511. which were not known. The minimum weight codewords of the codes B(n2/sup h/-1) are studied.

The logarithms developed for Zech's logarithms save a substantial amount of computer memory by storing only a table of Zech's logarithms. These algorithms are suitable for implementation in a programmable microprocessor or special-purpose VLSI chip.

The error criterion implies a bounded tree or trellis search region: the shape of this is calculated for the case of a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability P and random tree codes of rate R. Since the search region is finite at all combinations of p and R below capacity, there is no cutoff rate phenomenon for any P/sub e/>0. The decoder delay (search depth), the path storage size, and the number of algorithm steps for several tree search methods are calculated. These include searches without backtracking and backtracking searches that are depth- and metric-first. The search depth of the non-backtracking decoders satisfies the Gallager reliability exponent for block codes. In average paths searched, the backtracking decoders are much more efficient, but all types require the same peak storage allocation.

This behavior is exploited to obtain trade-offs between asymptotic system performances and oversampling ratios, for several sigma-delta modulator/decoding filter pairs. For an L-loop modulator with a simple sinc/sup L+1/ decoding filter, it is shown that doubling the oversampling ratio can result in an improvement of 3.01(2L+1) dB in the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3697/00135642.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.135642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.135642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiloop sigma-delta quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Quantization","Nonlinear filters","Feedback loop","Noise shaping","Decoding","Timing","System performance","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","delta modulation","error statistics","filtering and prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiloop sigma-delta modulator","DC input","statistical behavior","error process","sinusoidal inputs","asymptotic system performances","oversampling ratios","decoding filter","L-loop modulator","signal-to-quantization-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Multiloop sigma-delta quantization","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4226464","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiloop sigma-delta quantization","sourcePdf":"00135642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041703S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"39","articleId":"135642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":135644,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

It is shown that a necessary condition for an input mu to be optimal, assuming a unity amplitude constraint is that it satisfy the fixed-point equation=sgn (F( mu )), where the functional F is the convolution of mu with the autocorrelation function of the channel impulse response. It is also shown that all solutions to this equation for which mod mu mod =1 almost everywhere correspond to local maxima of the output energy. Iteratively recomputing mu from the fixed-point equation leads to an algorithm for finding local optima. Numerical results are given for the cases where the transfer function is ideal low-pass and has two poles.

Family A has period L=2/sup r/-1. size L+2. and maximum nontrivial correlation magnitude C/sub max/<or=1+ square root (L+1), where r is a positive integer. Family B has period L=2(2/sup r/-1). size (L+2)/4. and C/sub max/ for complex-valued sequences. Of particular interest, family A has the same size and period as the family of binary Gold sequences. but its maximum nontrivial correlation is smaller by a factor of square root 2. Since the Gold family for r odd is optimal with respect to the Welch bound restricted to binary sequences, family A is thus superior to the best possible binary design of the same family size. Unlike the Gold design, families A and B are asymptotically optimal whether r is odd or even. Both families are suitable for achieving code-division multiple-access and are easily, implemented using shift registers. The exact distribution of correlation values is given for both families.<<ETX>>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","volume":"38","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4226471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"4-phase sequences with near-optimum correlation properties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"4-phase sequences with near-optimum correlation properties","sourcePdf":"00135649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046522S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"201","articleId":"135649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":135651,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The signal constellation consists of all points from some translate of a lattice Lambda that lie within a region R. The signal constellation is partitioned into T annular subconstellations Omega /sub o/,..., Omega /sub T-1/, by scaling the region R. Signal points in the same subconstellation are used equiprobably, and a shaping code selects region Omega /sub i/ with frequency f/sub i/. If the signal constellation is partitioned into annular subconstellations of unequal size. then the transmission rate should vary with the choice of codeword in the shaping code. and it will be necessary to queue the data in buffers. It is described how the balanced binary codes constructed by D. E. Knuth (1986) can be used to avoid a data rate that is probabilistic. The basic idea is that if symbols 0 and 1 represent constellations of unequal size. and if all shaping codewords have equally many 0's and 1's, then the data rate will be deterministic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.135651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3697/00135651.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.135651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balanced codes and nonequiprobable signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135651/","displayDocTitle":"Balanced codes and nonequiprobable signaling","volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4226473","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balanced codes and nonequiprobable signaling","sourcePdf":"00135651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082658S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","articleId":"135651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":135652,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

Conflict resolution expertise consists of a taxonomy of design conflict classes and associated general advice suitable for resolving conflicts in these classes. The abstract nature of conflict resolution expertise makes it applicable to a wide variety of design domains. The author describes this conflict resolution model and provides examples of its operation from an implemented cooperative design system for local area network design that uses machine-based design agents.

A cooperative feature-matching technique is proposed that is implemented by a Hopfield neural network. The proposed matching technique uses the parallelism of the neural network to globally match all the objects in the input scene against all the object models in the model-database at the same time. A global model graph representing all the object models is constructed where each node in the graph represents a feature that has a numerical feature value and is connected to other nodes by an arc representing the relationship or compatibility between them. Object recognition is formulated as matching this global model with an input scene graph representing a single object or several overlapping objects. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with that of a relaxation technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.135694","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1535","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3698/00135694.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.135694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object recognition by a Hopfield neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Hopfield neural networks","Layout","Service robots","Robot kinematics","Two dimensional displays","Neural networks","Computer vision","Neurons","Lapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","graph theory","neural nets","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D model based object recognition","pattern recognition","Hopfield neural network","cooperative feature-matching","global model graph","input scene graph","overlapping objects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Object recognition by a Hopfield neural network","volume":"21","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4205376","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object recognition by a Hopfield neural network","sourcePdf":"00135694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060817S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","isNumber":"3698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"88","articleId":"135694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":135695,"authors":[{"name":"E.C.-K.

A three-stage form of the system is proposed. It comprises three basic functional components realizing matching, nonlinear transformation, and inverse matching. The proposed scheme has a referential structure which shows that the fuzzy set of a decision is not determined by the objectives themselves, but by the levels of the matching with some prototype decision situations. Both matching and inverse matching procedures involve some logic-based mechanisms (equality indices). Neural nets are used to realize the nonlinear mapping indicated in the general scheme. Several advantages of the referential model, including exhaustive usage of knowledge about the decision problem conveyed by prototype situations, and an introduction of mechanisms of evaluation of the relevancy of fuzzy decisions, are highlighted. Additional indices expressing consistency of decision scenarios are developed. Detailed numerical studies demonstrate the performance of the method and provide some additional background concerning an evaluation of the results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.135702","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1604","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3698/00135702.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.135702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A referential scheme of fuzzy decision making and its neural network structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Decision making","Neural networks","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy logic","Prototypes","Councils","Research and development","Equations","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","fuzzy logic","fuzzy set theory","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","fuzzy logic","fuzzy decision making","neural network structure","imprecise objectives","nonlinear transformation","inverse matching","equality indices","nonlinear mapping","referential model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"A referential scheme of fuzzy decision making and its neural network structure","volume":"21","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4205384","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A referential scheme of fuzzy decision making and its neural network structure","sourcePdf":"00135702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042762S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1991","isNumber":"3698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"14","articleId":"135702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":135711,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The use of the new representations is demonstrated by some examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.135743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3700/00135743.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.135743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","startPage":"711","endPage":"719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the representation of infinite-length distributed RC one-ports","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=135743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"On the representation of infinite-length distributed RC one-ports","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135743/","volume":"38","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3991628","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the representation of infinite-length distributed RC one-ports","sourcePdf":"00135743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043932S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"119","articleId":"135743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":135746,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The internal feedback or recursion in these algorithms makes it difficult to implement recursive systems concurrently using either pipelining or parallelism. In the past, look-ahead computation techniques were successfully applied to create necessary concurrency in linear recursive and some nonlinear recursive operations (such as the add-compare-select operation). Novel computation approaches are proposed, and the look-ahead technique is extended to pipeline the feedback loops containing finite-level quantizers. Approaches to pipeline piecewise-linear recursive systems are presented.

A formal analysis of the signal propagation delay in VLSI circuits is presented. It is shown that, depending on the circuit parameters, there are basically two delay domains: the RC delay domain and the transmission-line-delay domain. The results derived from the more traditional lumped-RC model mainly capture the properties of the RC delay domain. However, in the transmission-line-delay domain the wire inductance becomes an important factor, and hence RC modeling is no longer adequate to estimate the delay. Two delay formulas are derived in this paper for the RC delay domain and the transmission-line-delay domain. The effect of feature size scaling on VLSI circuit performance is evaluated, and the inherent limitation on scaling due to interconnection delay is discussed. Finally, the relationship between delay and technology parameters such as wire resistance, capacitance, inductance, wire width and length, and load capacitance is investigated to provide design guidelines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","volume":"38","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3991633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Interconnection delay in very high-speed VLSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnection delay in very high-speed VLSI","sourcePdf":"00135749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038824S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"51","articleId":"135749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135751,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Liang Wang","id":"37068528500"},{"name":"Jung-Lung Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Lung Lin","id":"37383829700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-4094"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1276"}],"articleNumber":"135751","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","Galois fields","Digital filters","Signal processing algorithms","Circuits","Finite impulse response filter","IIR filters","Speech processing","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplying circuits","parallel architectures","systolic arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipliers","finite fields","parallel-in-parallel-out systolic array","serial-in-serial-out systolic array","standard basis representation","regularity","modularity","concurrency","unidirectional data flow","throughput rates","fault-tolerant design","fault-tolerant design","control signal"]}],"abstract":"A parallel-in-parallel-out systolic array and a serial-in-serial-out systolic array are proposed for fast multiplication in finite fields GF(2/sup m/) with the standard basis representation.

The experiment used 34 LISP and 48 PASCAL computer science students in two repeated measures designs. Findings of the study are reported and analyzed. The results strongly suggest that investigation of programming constructs should take place in the context of specific programming languages. Since a number of languages provide similar kinds of programming constructs, it is difficult for programmers to choose those implementations that best suit their needs. One way of encouraging the use of desirable constructs would be to develop languages adapted to certain types of tasks. Such an approach would inherently lead to cognitive fit and the attendant performance benefits would be realized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4175716","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive fit: an empirical study of recursion and iteration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive fit: an empirical study of recursion and iteration","sourcePdf":"00135770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047003S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"31","articleId":"135770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135775,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

A principal-components procedure was employed to reduce simple multicollinear complexity metrics to uncorrelated measures on orthogonal complexity domains. These uncorrelated measures were then used to classify programs into alternate groups, depending on the metric values of the program. The criterion variable for group determination was a quality measure of faults or changes made to the programs. The discriminant analysis was conducted on two distinct data sets from large commercial systems. The basic discriminant model was constructed from deliberately biased data to magnify differences in metric values between the discriminant groups. The technique was successful in classifying programs with a relatively low error rate. While the use of linear regression models has produced models of limited value, this procedure shows great promise for use in the detection of program modules with potential for faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.135775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.135775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/3701/00135775.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The detection of fault-prone programs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"The detection of fault-prone programs","volume":"18","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4175721","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The detection of fault-prone programs","sourcePdf":"00135775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042397S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"278","articleId":"135775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":135813,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A hybrid decision tree classifier design procedure that produces efficient and accurate classifiers for this situation is proposed. In doing so, several key questions are addressed, among them the question of the feature extraction techniques to be used and the mathematical relationship between sample size, dimensionality, and risk value. Empirical tests comparing the hybrid design classifier with a conventional single layered one are presented. They suggest that the hybrid design produces higher accuracy with fewer features. The need for fewer features is an important advantage, because it reflects favorably on both the size of the training set needed and the amount of computation time that will be needed in analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.135813","startPage":"518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3703/00135813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.135813","endPage":"528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical classifier design in high-dimensional numerous class cases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/135813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical classifier design in high-dimensional numerous class cases","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4004504","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical classifier design in high-dimensional numerous class cases","sourcePdf":"00135813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042454S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"58","articleId":"135813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":135815,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

The coupling between polarization channels is minimized by using local intensity ratios. The degree of speckle reduction is similar to two-look or three-look processing. The same algorithm can also be used to process multifrequency polarimetric SAR. For three-frequency aircraft SAR data speckle reduction equivalent to six-look processing can be achieved. Further speckle reduction is possible by applying speckle filters in the spatial domain. In addition, a vector speckle filter which operates simultaneously in the polarization and spatial domains is tested. Experimental results with simulated polarimetric SAR as well as one-look and multilook parametric SAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of these speckle reductions, with minimum resolution broadening and coupling between polarimetric and frequency channels.

The effects of imperfect power control are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.136063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3709/00136063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.136063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3709","startPage":"680","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation for cellular CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation for cellular CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4184719","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation for cellular CDMA","sourcePdf":"00136063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034224S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"104","articleId":"136063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":136064,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

User signals may arrive in a code-asynchronous fashion at the receiver, however, it is shown that by using the scheme the average code cross-correlation is minimal compared to the classic code division multiple access (CDMA) system. Both the chip-synchronous and asynchronous cases are investigated and the uniform and optimal cases of dividing the users into orthogonal groups are analyzed. The superior bit error and network data throughput results in the different fading and forward error correction environments make the system a strong candidate for competitive domestic applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.136064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3709/00136064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.136064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3709","startPage":"690","endPage":"704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified SUGAR/DS: a new CDMA scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified SUGAR/DS: a new CDMA scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4184720","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified SUGAR/DS: a new CDMA scheme","sourcePdf":"00136064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043225S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","articleId":"136064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":136065,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The authors consider a sliding correlator-type structure for the acquisition scheme, which the mean acquisition time is proportional to the average number of samples used for a synchronization test. Sequential acquisition requires the knowledge of the partial correlation of the pseudonoise (PN) sequence, however, as the partial correlation of an m sequence is difficult to model the authors propose an approximate upper bound. This is then piecewise linearized and used for designing the SPRT which is then compared to the fixed-dwell time technique, a scheme using the fixed sample size test. Numerical results show that the saving of acquisition time by the SPRT increases as the desired probabilities of errors and/or the input SNR decrease.

An improved condition for the peak locations is given, that allows for the wavefront curvature of the leaky mode in the bent fiber, since it is derived by wave optics. Simple explicit relations for both the peak spacings and the peak-to-trough ratio are given. Their asymptotic forms for small bend radii are independent of the fundamental-mode parameters. An interpretation of oscillations in the bend-loss curves in terms of a thin-film filter effect of the triple-layer structure on the lateral leaky-mode radiation fully explains the behavior, especially the loss increase in the peaks compared to the case of an infinite cladding. The agreement with numerical and experimental results of other authors is excellent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.136086","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3710/00136086.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.136086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bending losses of coated single-mode fibers: a simple approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136086/","displayDocTitle":"Bending losses of coated single-mode fibers: a simple approach","volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4200280","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bending losses of coated single-mode fibers: a simple approach","sourcePdf":"00136086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045397S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"93","articleId":"136086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":136087,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Design requirements for a 128-line photonic switching system suitable for a small-sized private branch exchange requirement are presented along with experimental results. It has been shown that a five-stage switch cascade, suitable for such a high-capacity switching system with a power margin of greater than 5 dB in the highest switch loss situation is possible, using low-facet-reflection TWAs. Such TWA devices have been developed in the 1.3- mu m wavelength region with maximum fiber-to-fiber gain values of 15 dB.

The analysis quantifies in particular how optical image rejection receiver configurations reduce the influence of optical amplifier noise on system performance. Two types of optical image rejection receivers are investigated: a novel, all-optical configuration and the conventional, microwave-based configuration. The analysis shows that local oscillator-spontaneous emission beat noise (LO-SP), signal-spontaneous emission beat noise (S-SP), and spontaneous-spontaneous beat noise (SP-SP) can all be reduced by 3 dB, thereby doubling the dynamic range of the optical amplifier. A 2.5-dB improvement in dynamic range has been demonstrated experimentally with the all-optical image rejection configuration. The implications of the increased dynamic range thus obtained are also discussed from a systems point of view.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of optical amplifier noise in coherent optical communication systems with optical image rejection receivers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.136102","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3710/00136102.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.136102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of optical amplifier noise in coherent optical communication systems with optical image rejection receivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4200296","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of optical amplifier noise in coherent optical communication systems with optical image rejection receivers","sourcePdf":"00136102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045988S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"10","articleId":"136102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":136104,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Combining the QPSK microwave modulation format with the subcarrier multiplexing technique results in a total of 20 video channels at 50 Mb/s being transmitted on 10 microwave subcarriers. Using a differential encoding approach, this system provides good receiver sensitivity and bandwidth efficiency, while maintaining a simple receiver design. No carrier recovery circuit or phase-locked loop is required for demodulation, which greatly reduces the receiver complexity. It is demonstrated that only a standard delay and multiply demodulator are necessary. With optical heterodyne detection, a receiver sensitivity of -37.5 dBm is achieved for the 20 channel system. The extension of this technique to intensity modulated direct detection subcarrier systems along with migration scenarios for digital video and broadband services is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3710/00136104.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"685","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.136104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.136104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterodyne video transmission with differentially encoded quadrature phase shift keying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Quadrature phase shift keying","Microwave theory and techniques","Demodulation","Modulation","Bandwidth","Circuits","Phase locked loops","Delay","Optical mixing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","demodulation","encoding","multiplexing","optical links","optical modulation","phase shift keying","receivers","sensitivity","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterodyne transmission experiments","digital video systems","video transmission","differentially encoded quadrature phase shift keying","multiple video channels","QPSK","QPSK microwave modulation format","subcarrier multiplexing technique","microwave subcarriers","receiver sensitivity","bandwidth efficiency","receiver design","demodulation","receiver complexity","standard delay and multiply demodulator","optical heterodyne detection","20 channel system","intensity modulated","direct detection subcarrier systems","broadband services","50 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Heterodyne video transmission with differentially encoded quadrature phase shift keying","volume":"10","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4200298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterodyne video transmission with differentially encoded quadrature phase shift keying","sourcePdf":"00136104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052118S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","articleId":"136104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":136217,"authors":[{"name":"P.D.

The technology has the capability of reducing fuel consumption, which can in turn reduce emissions. In a regional setting it can potentially shift emissions both in volumes and in physical areas to avoid problem situations. With its capability to strategically shift generation and significantly affect emissions and air quality it can 'stretch' clean energy generation options.

Simple analytical design equations are derived for the basic performance parameters of the converter operating in the continuous conduction mode (CCM) using Fourier series techniques and a high-Q/sub L/ assumption. Three types of class-D current-driven rectifiers are considered. The diode threshold voltage and forward resistance as well as the ESR of the output filter capacitor are taken into account.

The topology is based on the series connection of three four-valve single-phase bridges, which allows the conventional two-stage logic SPWM strategy to be used without interphase interference. The problems of stability and low harmonic waveform distortion are identified. Solutions are found by using a simple local notch filter feedback circuit that fulfils the dual function of stabilizing and active filtering. From the clarification given by this more expensive but less constrained topology, the stage is set for the next step in incorporating the lessons learned to the more economical topology based on the six-valve, three phase parallel bridge, which requires a tristate logic for PWM control when operating in the current-source configuration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.136250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3714","startPage":"356","endPage":"363","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/3714/00136250.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.136250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unity power factor current-regulated SPWM rectifier with a notch feedback for stabilization and active filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Rectifiers","Circuit topology","Bridge circuits","Logic","Active filters","Pulse width modulation","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","control system analysis","electric current control","feedback","harmonics","notch filters","power factor","pulse width modulation","rectifiers","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM","stability","current control","bridge circuits","unity power factor","rectifier","notch feedback","stabilization","active filtering","sinusoidal pulsewidth modulated","harmonic waveform distortion","notch filter","topology","three phase","tristate logic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"A unity power factor current-regulated SPWM rectifier with a notch feedback for stabilization and active filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4181251","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unity power factor current-regulated SPWM rectifier with a notch feedback for stabilization and active filtering","sourcePdf":"00136250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033512S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"25","articleId":"136250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":136251,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

A quantitative analysis of single and three-phase rectifier line current harmonics and power factor as a function of the output filter inductance is presented. For the single phase rectifier, one value of finite output filter inductance produces maximum power factor and a different value of finite output filter inductance produces minimum line current harmonics. For the three phase rectifier, a near-infinite output filter inductance produces minimum line current harmonics and maximum power factor, and the smallest inductance that approximates a near-infinite inductance is determined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.136251","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/3714/00136251.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.136251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rectifier for minimum line-current harmonics and maximum power factor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"Rectifier for minimum line-current harmonics and maximum power factor","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4181248","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rectifier for minimum line-current harmonics and maximum power factor","sourcePdf":"00136251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212795S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"59","articleId":"136251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":136254,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Seong Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Seong Oh","id":"37087849826"},{"name":"Kwan Yuhl Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwan Yuhl Cho","id":"37087193177"},{"name":"Myong Joong Youn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myong Joong Youn","id":"37088169651"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"136254","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136254","abstract":"A current control technique for a voltage-fed PWM inverter is presented.

The discretized current controller is proposed to reduce the current error as fast as possible using the deadbeat control strategy and to stabilize the closed loop system asymptotically when the variations of load parameters are given in the predetermined stabilized region. This proposed control scheme is realized by the symmetrical uniform sampling method and is easily implemented using a microprocessor-based system.

In conventional PWMs the pulse frequency is kept constant. In the proposed PFM, however, the pulse frequency is adjusted. The PFM technique is intended to not only reduce the magnetic acoustic noises of driven motors but also to improve the performance of sinusoidal inverters. The PWM pulse patterns are basically controlled so that the time-integral function of the voltage vectors in the space vector notation may draw a circular locus. In addition to this, the pulse frequency, of PWM is also controlled so that the performance index (PI), which represents the degree of achieved objectives, may be minimized. Two PIs, one for minimizing the distortion of output currents and the other for minimizing the torque pulsation of driven motors, are employed. The method is implemented using a single-chip microprocessor, and the experimental results demonstrate its validity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pulse frequency modulated PWM inverter for induction motor drives","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.136258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/3714/00136258.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.136258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"A pulse frequency modulated PWM inverter for induction motor drives","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4181256","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pulse frequency modulated PWM inverter for induction motor drives","sourcePdf":"00136258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027737S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","articleId":"136258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":136275,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Optimization techniques such as the branch and bound algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm are used to systematically design pre-distorted masks under incoherent and partially coherent illumination. Computer simulations are used to show that the intensity contour shapes and developed resist shapes of their designed mask patterns are sharper than those of conventional masks. The designed phase-shifting masks are shown to result in higher contrast as well as sharper contours than binary masks. An example of phase conflicting masks designed with the algorithm is shown to outperform a simple intuitive design. This example indicates that a fairly general design procedure consisting of alternating phase shifts and their optimized phase-shift masks is a viable candidate for future phase-shifting mask design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4176786","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Binary and phase shifting mask design for optical lithography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary and phase shifting mask design for optical lithography","sourcePdf":"00136275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051507S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"68","articleId":"136275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":136478,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The probabilities of the hidden state sequences of HMMs are modeled by GDs in place of the transition probabilities. The GDs offer a general way in modeling neighbor interactions of Markov random fields where the Markov chains in HMMs are special cases. An algorithm for estimating the model parameters is developed based on Baum reestimation, and an algorithm for computing the probability terms is developed using a lattice structure. The GD models were used for experiments in speech recognition on the TI speaker-independent, isolated digit database. The observation sequences of the speech signals were modeled by mixture Gaussian autoregressive densities. The energy functions of the GDs were developed using very few parameters and proved adequate in hidden layer modeling. The results of the experiments showed that the GD models performed at least as well as the HMM models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3728/00136535.pdf","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.136535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.136535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Gibbs distribution to hidden Markov modeling in speaker independent isolated word recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Lattices","Parameter estimation","Databases","Interactive systems","Signal processing algorithms","Markov random fields","Image texture","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","parameter estimation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model parameter estimation","TI speaker independent isolated digit database","Gibbs distribution","hidden Markov modeling","speaker independent isolated word recognition","hidden state sequences","neighbor interactions","Markov random fields","Baum reestimation","algorithm","mixture Gaussian autoregressive densities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Gibbs distribution to hidden Markov modeling in speaker independent isolated word recognition","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3983877","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Gibbs distribution to hidden Markov modeling in speaker independent isolated word recognition","sourcePdf":"00136535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05373S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"3728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","articleId":"136535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":136537,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In addition to giving examples of the phenomenon, it is explained why and how disconnected decision regions are formed. Through the hypothesization of the existence of additional virtual cells formed by the first layer, it is shown how the decision regions formed by the second layer can indeed be disconnected. It is shown that the number of such disconnected regions can be very large.

Theoretical results on roundoff and coefficient quantization errors in these filters are presented.

Moreover, it is shown that while ESPRIT performs poorly for signals propagating in parallel (or close to parallel) with the array displacement vector, the advocated technique does not exhibit such weakness. Finally, using two subarrays, ESPRIT cannot resolve azimuth and elevation even when the sensors are not collinear. However, the interpolated ESPRIT procedure resolves azimuth and elevation using only a single array.

One uses the notion of the finite fields, and the other uses the notion of the difference sets. In general, the conventional algorithms are only able to solve the problems that satisfy an affine plane or a finite projective plane. The proposed algorithm is able to solve BIBD problems regardless of the condition of an affine plane or a finite projective plane. The proposed algorithm was verified by simulation runs. The simulation results demonstrated that the number of iteration steps for the system to converge to the solution increases slightly with the problem size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.136575","startPage":"243","endPage":"247","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/3729/00136575.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.136575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network parallel computing for BIBD problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Parallel processing","Neurons","Signal processing algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Design for experiments","Codes","Switches","Galois fields","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematics computing","neural nets","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["McCulloch-Pitts binary neurons","BIBD problems","balanced incomplete block design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural network parallel computing for BIBD problems","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4182325","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network parallel computing for BIBD problems","sourcePdf":"00136575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045079S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"4","articleId":"136575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":136578,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Two FSVQ designs, namely side match vector quantizers (SMVQs) and overlap match vector quantizers (OMVQs), are introduced. These designs take advantage of the 2-D spatial contiguity of pixel vectors as well as the high spatial correlation of pixels in typical gray-level images. SMVQ and OMVQ try to minimize the granular noise that causes visible pixel block boundaries in ordinary VQ. For 512 by 512 gray-level images, SMVQ and OMVQ can achieve communication quality reproduction at an average of 1/2 b/pixel per image frame, and acceptable quality reproduction. Because block boundaries are less visible, the perceived improvement in quality over ordinary VQ is even greater. Owing to the structure of SMVQ and OMVQ, simple variable length noiseless codes can achieve as much as 60% bit rate reduction over fixed-length noiseless codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3730/00136594.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"185","doi":"10.1109/83.136594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.136594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Side match and overlap match vector quantizers for images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"Side match and overlap match vector quantizers for images","publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4192957","pubMedId":"18296152","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Side match and overlap match vector quantizers for images","sourcePdf":"00136594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026104S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"207","articleId":"136594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":136595,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

Applying well-developed decomposition properties of mathematical morphology, one can significantly reduce the tremendous cost of global operations to that of small neighborhood operations suitable for parallel pipelined computers. First, the distance transformation using mathematical morphology is developed. Then several approximations of the Euclidean distance are discussed. The decomposition of the Euclidean distance structuring element is presented. The decomposition technique employs a set of 3 by 3 gray scale morphological erosions with suitable weighted structuring elements and combines the outputs using the minimum operator. Real-valued distance transformations are considered during the processes and the result is approximated to the closest integer in the final output image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.136596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"197","endPage":"204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3730/00136596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.136596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mathematical morphology approach to Euclidean distance transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Morphology","Euclidean distance","Pixel","Shape measurement","Iterative algorithms","Digital images","Costs","Concurrent computing","Image processing","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","parallel processing","pipeline processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structuring element decomposition","mathematical morphology","Euclidean distance transformation","binary digital image","global operations","neighborhood operations","parallel pipelined computers","approximations","gray scale morphological erosions","weighted structuring elements","minimum operator","output image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical morphology approach to Euclidean distance transformation","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4192959","pubMedId":"18296154","publicationDate":"April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136596/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical morphology approach to Euclidean distance transformation","sourcePdf":"00136596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049981S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"79","articleId":"136596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":136597,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This method involves two steps. First, a wavelet transform used in order to obtain a set of biorthogonal subclasses of images: the original image is decomposed at different scales using a pyramidal algorithm architecture. The decomposition is along the vertical and horizontal directions and maintains constant the number of pixels required to describe the image. Second, according to Shannon's rate distortion theory, the wavelet coefficients are vector quantized using a multiresolution codebook. To encode the wavelet coefficients, a noise shaping bit allocation procedure which assumes that details at high resolution are less visible to the human eye is proposed. In order to allow the receiver to recognize a picture as quickly as possible at minimum cost, a progressive transmission scheme is presented. It is shown that the wavelet transform is particularly well adapted to progressive transmission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.136597","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3730/00136597.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.136597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding using wavelet transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136597/","displayDocTitle":"Image coding using wavelet transform","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4192960","pubMedId":"18296155","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding using wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00136597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042806S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"2318","articleId":"136597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":136599,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The authors consider a multiplicative noise with a real phase (i.e. the SAR signal's phase is contaminated but its amplitude is uncorrupted) that possesses unknown functional characteristics with respect to the radar signal's temporal frequencies. A perturbation solution for phase reconstruction from amplitude is developed from a wave equation governing the SAR signal and a Riccati equation that relates the amplitude and phase functions of the SAR signal. This solution is converted into a noniterative analytical solution in terms of the moments and powers of the log amplitude function. Next, the authors consider a multiplicative noise with a complex phase (i.e. both the amplitude and phase of the SAR signal are contaminated) that varies linearly with respect to the radar signal's temporal frequencies. The two wave equations governing the SAR signal at two temporal frequencies of the radar signal are combined to derive a method to reconstruct the complex phase error function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.136599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3730/00136599.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"242","doi":"10.1109/83.136599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase and amplitude phase restoration in synthetic aperture radar imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1992","displayDocTitle":"Phase and amplitude phase restoration in synthetic aperture radar imaging","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4192962","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18296157","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase and amplitude phase restoration in synthetic aperture radar imaging","sourcePdf":"00136599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022716S","chronDate":"April  1992","isNumber":"3730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"10","articleId":"136599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":136601,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

These provide comparisons with: (i) an expert designer; and (ii) recently published algorithms for pipeline synthesis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1990.136625","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","pdfPath":"/iel2/273/3731/00136625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1990.136625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3731","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to pipeline optimisation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to pipeline optimisation","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136625/","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3985898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to pipeline optimisation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00136625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04285S","chronDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","isNumber":"3731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"273","citationCount":"32","articleId":"136625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":136629,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, both the amount of multiplexing and interconnect are crucial factors to both the delay and the area of a circuit. In this paper it is shown that when variables are grouped into register files and operations are assigned to modules to minimise the interconnections, significant savings (20%) can be obtained in the number of local interconnections and the amount of global interconnect on the expense of only slightly more register area. This can be enhanced by splitting read and write phases of registers and even more by introducing serial (re-) write operations for the same value. The variable grouping is based on edge colouring algorithms that provide a sharp upper bound on the number of colours needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1990.136635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1990.136635","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","pdfPath":"/iel2/273/3731/00136635.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnect optimisation during data path allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect optimisation during data path allocation","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3999740","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect optimisation during data path allocation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00136635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035098S","chronDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","isNumber":"3731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"273","citationCount":"23","articleId":"136635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":136636,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The method is demonstrated by the simulation of an FM receiver architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1990.136652","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","pdfPath":"/iel2/273/3731/00136652.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1990.136652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=136652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136652/","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven behavioural simulation of analogue transfer functions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3999757","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven behavioural simulation of analogue transfer functions","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00136652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023306S","chronDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","isNumber":"3731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"273","citationCount":"14","articleId":"136652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":136693,"authors":[{"name":"P.

As opposed to simulated annealing, which normally uses pairwise interchange for transforming the layout configuration, in a genetic algorithm, the crossover operator is used to combine two current configurations to generate a new configuration (similar to reproduction in living organisms). The traditional genetic crossover operator, as proposed by Holland (1985), cannot be applied to the cell placement problem without modification, because it occasionally results in illegal placement. A great deal of effort has therefore been directed towards finding an efficient crossover operator for this problem domain. Three powerful crossover operators have been implemented, and their performance in reducing the interconnect length has been compared. The results of this comparison were conclusively in favour of Cycle crossover. Besides crossover, two other genetic operators-mutation and inversion-have been used to improve the efficiency of the search process. In order to benchmark the performance of GASP-1, the best possible compromise of the parameters was picked, and the algorithm was run to place five industrial circuits consisting of 100 to 800 cells. The results were very encouraging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDAC.1990.136728","startPage":"660","endPage":"664","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDAC.1990.136728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3731","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the European Design Automation Conference, 1990., EDAC.","pdfPath":"/iel2/273/3731/00136728.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GASP-a genetic algorithm for standard cell placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/136728/","displayDocTitle":"GASP-a genetic algorithm for standard cell placement","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3999809","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GASP-a genetic algorithm for standard cell placement","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00136728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078709S","chronDate":"12-15 Mar 1990","isNumber":"3731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"273","citationCount":"12","articleId":"136728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":137231,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first, including deregulation movements and growing environmental concerns, is acting to increase the complexity of operations. The second, including new computer technologies and emerging knowledge-based agents, provides some means for handling additional complexity. The authors argue that organizational changes will have to be made before the second set of forces can be applied to effectively counter the first. To make this argument, a framework for discussing organizational structures is presented. Then the structures of the two generations of computer-based, multiagent systems that have been developed for operations are reviewed. It is pointed out that these structures are well-suited to the algorithmic tasks involved in operations but not to the knowledge-based tasks. The authors conclude with some suggestions for research into alternative structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137231/","volume":"80","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4197788","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiagent organizations for real-time operations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiagent organizations for real-time operations","sourcePdf":"00137231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156147S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"27","articleId":"137231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":137284,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.M.

This method is evaluated by an error-and-sensitivity analysis using healthy subject data. Of three potential error sources (the reference system, the accelerometers, and the model assumptions) the last is found to be the most important. Model calculations based on data obtained by the Elite video motion analysis system showed the rigid-body assumption error to be dominant for high frequencies (>10 Hz), with vibrations in the order of 1 mm resulting in errors of one radial or more. For low frequencies (<5 Hz), the imperfect fixation of the accelerometers combined with a nonhinge-type knee joint gave an error contribution of +or-0.03 rad. The walking pattern was assumed to be two-dimensional, which was shown to result in an error of +or-0.04 rad. Accelerations due to rotations of the segments could be neglected. The total error computed for low frequencies (+or-0.07 rad) is comparable to the experimental difference between the current and the reference system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","volume":"38","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4108632","pubMedId":"1774080","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Lower extremity angle measurement with accelerometers-error and sensitivity analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower extremity angle measurement with accelerometers-error and sensitivity analysis","sourcePdf":"00137284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027182S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"68","articleId":"137284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":137287,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Two controllers use stimulus pulse width (PW) (or recruitment) modulation to grade muscle force (the fixed-parameter, first-order PW controller and the adaptive controller). The third controller varies both stimulus pulse (SP) width and period simultaneously for muscle force modulation (the PW/SP controller). The three tasks tested were isometric torque control, unloaded position tracking, and control of transitions between isometric and unloaded conditions. The comparative evaluation was carried out in an intact cat ankle joint with stimulation of tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles. The simplest PW controller demonstrated robust control for all tasks. The PW/SP controller improved the performance of the PW controller significantly for control of isometric torque and load transition, but only slightly for control of unloaded joint position. However, the adaptive controller did not consistently achieve a significant improvement in performance compared with the PW controller for any task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.137287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.137287","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/3737/00137287.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback control methods for task regulation by electrical stimulation of muscles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Feedback control methods for task regulation by electrical stimulation of muscles","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4108635","pubMedId":"1774083","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137287/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback control methods for task regulation by electrical stimulation of muscles","sourcePdf":"00137287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04046S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"44","articleId":"137287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":137316,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

Industry-standard digital EEPROM cells can be programmed to any analog value of threshold voltage, but programming characteristics of different devices on the same chip vary. The programming window of a single device also narrows with cycling. These phenomena necessitate the use of a feedback-based programming scheme. Stressing at high temperature suggests that charge retention is good even at 175 degrees C. The linear variation of threshold voltage with temperature implies that temperature compensation of EEPROM is no more complicated than its conventional MOSFET counterpart. The drain current in the saturation region is found to be a quadratic function of drain voltage when the floating-gate-to-drain overlap capacitance is adequately large. A differential circuit that uses this property to generate the multiplication function required of neural net synapses is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.137321","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1419","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3738/00137321.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.137321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEPROM as an analog storage device, with particular applications in neutral networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["EPROM","Intelligent networks","Capacitance","Neural networks","Silicon compounds","Threshold voltage","Equivalent circuits","Temperature","Random access memory","Industrial control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue storage","circuit reliability","EPROM","MOS integrated circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile reconfigurable storage element","high temperature stressing","double polysilicon NMOS technology","reliability","analog storage device","neutral networks","EEPROM","modifiable weight storage","analog multiplication problems","digital EEPROM cells","threshold voltage","programming characteristics","cycling","feedback-based programming scheme","charge retention","temperature compensation","drain current","saturation region","differential circuit","neural net synapses","175 degC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"EEPROM as an analog storage device, with particular applications in neutral networks","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4200608","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEPROM as an analog storage device, with particular applications in neutral networks","sourcePdf":"00137321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03234S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"29","articleId":"137321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":137323,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The functional transistor calculates the weighted sum of all input signals at the gate level, and controls the 'on' and 'off' of the transistor based on the result of such a weighted sum operation. Since the function is quite analogous to that of biological neurons, the device is named a neuron MOSFET, or neuMOS (vMOS). The device is composed of a floating gate and multiples of input gates that capacitively interact with the floating gate. As the gate-level sum operation is performed in a voltage mode utilizing the capacitive coupling effect, essentially no power dissipation occurs in the calculation, making the device ideal for ULSI implementation. The basic characteristics of neuron MOSFETs as well as of simple circuit blocks are analyzed based on a simple transistor model and experiments. Making use of its very powerful function, a number of interesting circuit applications are explored.

A simple model, based on Gaussian statistics, is proposed where the degree of homogeneity between cells is expressed in terms of a technological quality factor k. It turns out that the increase of turn-off current for a gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) with a large number of cells is highly nonlinear. A major issue is the influence of the external load on the maximum turn-off current of a GTO. In the case of a typical inductive load, the turn-off capability of a device with a small number of segments n (n<100) hardly shows a difference between operation without and operation with a snubber. In contrast, for large GTOs (n>1000) snubberless operation imposes severe limitations on turn-off while a snubber with a realistic leakage inductance allows for a substantially larger turn-off current.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance limitations of a GTO with near-perfect technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.137333","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3738/00137333.pdf","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.137333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=137333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance limitations of a GTO with near-perfect technology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4200620","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance limitations of a GTO with near-perfect technology","sourcePdf":"00137333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072514S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"15","articleId":"137333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":137336,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The equations are implemented in a numerical algorithm that is much faster and more efficient than existing particle codes and shows good agreement with experimental results for V-I curves, over a wide parameter regime. Both analysis and simulation show that the hub density controls the RF amplification and saturation mechanisms. Anode current is determined by the difference of the E*B drift at the top of the hub from the RF phase velocity. Secondary production depends on the energy of the impacting electrons, and thus is sensitive to the electrostatic shielding of the cathode.

About 10% of the power is radiated in the cross-polarized component.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3740/00137380.pdf","doi":"10.1109/22.137380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.137380","startPage":"795","endPage":"800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The diagonal horn as a sub-millimeter wave antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137380/","displayDocTitle":"The diagonal horn as a sub-millimeter wave antenna","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4215590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The diagonal horn as a sub-millimeter wave antenna","sourcePdf":"00137380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033075S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"80","articleId":"137380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":137382,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It allows FM noise degradation at large-signal levels to be predicted easily and accurately. The theoretical analysis shows that (1) the nth-order subharmonic injection locking oscillator is primarily locked by the nth harmonic output of an injected signal, which is generated by the nonlinearity of the active device; (2) the minimum FM noise degradation factor of the nth-order subharmonically locked oscillator is n/sup 2/ when the injection power is sufficiently strong; and (3) a subharmonic injection locking LO with low injection power, good FM noise degradation, and large locking range can be designed by determining the optimum injection power level, by selecting the optimal nonlinear multiplication factor, and by decreasing the intrinsic noise level of the active device.

Although this structure constitutes a classical problem, no true wideband equivalent circuit seems to be available, that is, with elements dependent only on post geometry and, at the same time, capable of describing higher-order mode interaction. The availability of such an equivalent circuit is prerequisite for efficient CAD. A rigorous wideband model, including near-neighbor interaction, that is suitable for accurate filter synthesis and CAD by means of a desk-top computer is developed. Three applications to the design of multipost filters are presented with practical results in excellent agreement with computer predictions. Computation times are such that the analysis can be effected in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","volume":"40","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4219401","publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accurate full-band equivalent circuits of inductive posts in rectangular waveguide","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate full-band equivalent circuits of inductive posts in rectangular waveguide","sourcePdf":"00137409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031021S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","articleId":"137409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":137434,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

The switching function approach is utilized to derive relevant analytical expressions for input/output variables. A thorough evaluation of the NPC inverter topology based on the switching function approach is described. Optimal power control strategies for an NPC inverter employing programmed PWM patterns are proposed. For a constant-frequency variable-voltage NPC inverter power supply, the proposed strategy is to maintain a minimum specified total harmonic distortion employing a low-output impedance filter. In the case of an NPC inverter powering an AC motor drive, the proposed strategy is to maintain a minimum specified harmonic current factor. The proposed power control strategies are achieved without substantial increase in inverter switching frequency and are therefore suitable for high-power applications employing gate-turn-off-thyristor (GTO) type devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1992","accessionNumber":"4205396","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power control strategies for neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter topology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power control strategies for neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter topology","sourcePdf":"00137436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025394S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1992","isNumber":"3741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"48","articleId":"137436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":137441,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Application of rotor flux feedforward field orientation control for an induction machine reduces the system equations to contain only three state variables: rotor flux, velocity, and position. Maximum stator current and rotor velocity are set as constraints. Saturation effects are modeled to provide a state-dependent constraint on the rotor flux magnitude. Load is treated as a function of the rotor position, which is appropriate for many mechanical system applications. State trajectories of the system that optimize machine efficiency are found by dynamic programming. Flux trajectories for the optimal solution are found to vary significantly over the machine cycle.

The dependence of these losses on the magnitude and waveform of the excitation current, the switching frequency, and the conduction period per phase is investigated for a peaky and a flat-topped current waveform. The maximum losses are shown to occur in the stator core. SRM core losses are found to be proportional to the excitation magnetomotive force (MMF) and not the applied voltage, particularly under saturation.

The hypothesis on which detection is based is that the apparent rotor resistance of an induction motor will increase when a rotor bar breaks. Here, the apparent rotor resistance is that in the balanced steady-state single-phase electrical model of an induction motor. To detect broken rotor bars, measurements of stator voltage, stator current, stator excitation frequency, and rotor velocity are taken over a small range of velocity. These measurements are processed by a near least square error estimator to produce estimated motor states and parameters. In particular, rotor resistance is estimated and compared with its nominal value to detect broken rotor bars. As part of this estimation process, it is necessary to compensate for the thermal variation in rotor resistance. The broken rotor bar detector is evaluated experimentally using one stator and three rotors, one with a broken bar, from identical 3 hp induction motors. The estimated rotor resistance is clearly greater for the rotor with the broken bar.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.137460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"702","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.137460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3741","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/3741/00137460.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Bars","Induction motors","Stators","Electric resistance","Electrical resistance measurement","State estimation","Thermal resistance","Steady-state","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","electric current measurement","electrical faults","frequency measurement","induction motors","least squares approximations","machine testing","machine theory","parameter estimation","rotors","state estimation","stators","velocity measurement","voltage measurement","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine theory","machine testing","least square methods","compensation","induction motors","parameter estimation","broken rotor bars","detection","apparent rotor resistance","measurements","stator voltage","stator current","stator excitation frequency","rotor velocity","3 hp"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of broken rotor bars in induction motors using state and parameter estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137460/","volume":"28","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4205416","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of broken rotor bars in induction motors using state and parameter estimation","sourcePdf":"00137460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043944S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1992","isNumber":"3741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"69","articleId":"137460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":137498,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.R.

Compiled code implementation techniques using a threaded code organization are applied to the event-driven logic simulation algorithm. Simulation speed is increased by a factor of tip to 10 by this technique compared to conventional event-driven simulation. The technique is then extended to hierarchical simulation, in which a fan-out procedure and simulation procedure are generated for each unique module.

The simulator uses a portable machine model in which an architecture file describes the target machine. The simulator can be quickly ported to new machines by defining the architecture, while still obtaining high performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.137501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3743/00137501.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"737","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00137501.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.137501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical compiled code event-driven logic simulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=137501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137501/","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical compiled code event-driven logic simulator","volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3958982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical compiled code event-driven logic simulator","sourcePdf":"00137501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031178S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"3743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"52","articleId":"137501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":137503,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These methods break down the integer program that formulates the routing problem into small integer programs. These programs are solved exactly by using integer programming methods. Then the exact solutions of the small integer programs are pieced together to form an approximate solution of the original routing problem. The structure of the small integer programs is investigated. A greedy preprocessing method is proposed that, in effect, preroutes easily routable nets and reduces the remaining integer program to a fraction of the size in some cases, and eliminates it altogether in other cases. This yields a substantial reduction of the time required to solve the small integer programs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3743/00137503.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.137503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.137503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=137503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The efficient solution of integer programs for hierarchical global routing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Circuits","Linear programming","Helium","Wires","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","integer programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","circuit layout","integer programs","hierarchical global routing","integer programming methods","greedy preprocessing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"The efficient solution of integer programs for hierarchical global routing","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3958984","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The efficient solution of integer programs for hierarchical global routing","sourcePdf":"00137503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040459S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"3743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"23","articleId":"137503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":137505,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The unique aspect of Fasolt is that it uses information taken from a detailed layout model to choose optimizing transformations of the bus topology and the schedule of operations and transfers of an existing design. Such a system is called a feedback-drive system because it uses information derived at a low level (in this case, that of physical layout) to drive the selection of optimizing transformations at a higher level or levels (in this case, the scheduling and allocation levels). This allows the scheduling and topology synthesis steps to take wiring considerations into account in a way that has hitherto not been demonstrated in an automatic synthesis system. Experiments have shown that improvements in area, cycle time, and overall average delay can often be achieved in the same design using this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4174702","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Fasolt: a program for feedback-driven data-path optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fasolt: a program for feedback-driven data-path optimization","sourcePdf":"00137515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040743S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"25","articleId":"137515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":137516,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The authors present a relative scheduling formulation that supports operations with fixed and unbounded delays. The start time of an operation is specified in terms of offsets from the set of unbounded delay operations called anchors. The authors analyze a property, called well-posedness, of timing constraints. It is used to identify consistency of constraints in the presence of unbounded delay operations. The authors present an algorithm that will transform an ill-posed constraint graph into a minimally serialized well-posed constraint graph, if one exists. The anchors are then checked for redundancy, and they identify the minimum set of anchors that are required in computing the start time. They present an algorithm that schedules the operations relative to the anchors and yields a minimum schedule that satisfies the timing constraints, or detects whether no schedule exists, in polynomial time. They describe the generation of control logic from the resulting relative schedule.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3744/00137516.pdf","startPage":"696","endPage":"718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.137516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.137516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=137516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative scheduling under timing constraints: algorithms for high-level synthesis of digital circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Scheduling algorithm","High level synthesis","Digital circuits","Delay effects","Processor scheduling","Application specific integrated circuits","Hardware","DSL","Integrated circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","circuit CAD","digital integrated circuits","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","timing constraints","high-level synthesis","digital circuits","ASIC design","unbounded delays","relative scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/137516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Relative scheduling under timing constraints: algorithms for high-level synthesis of digital circuits","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4174703","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative scheduling under timing constraints: algorithms for high-level synthesis of digital circuits","sourcePdf":"00137516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083879S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"47","articleId":"137516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":137523,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The simplicity of these objects makes it possible to compute the cost function associated with them accurately and dynamically.

The interference between users is minimized owing to the low cross correlation values of the sequences of the Gold codes. In many cases the number of CDMA users is considerably less than the number of sequences in a Gold code. Thus, not all of the Gold code sequences are used and some reduction in interference between users can be obtained. A more reliable CDMA system is achieved by error correction coding methods that utilize multiple Gold code sequences for individual CDMA users. The sequences considered in the paper are restricted to binary sequences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1990.138141","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

A Kasami set of sequences is a set of 2/sup L/ binary sequences of length N=2/sup L/-1 where L is the degree of the higher order primitive polynomial used to generate the set and is even. The degree of the second primitive polynomial used to generate the Kasami set is L/2. Modified Kasami sequences that are obtained from primitive polynomials of degree L and M are presented. The length of these modified Kasami sequences is the least common multiple of 2/sup L/-1 and 2/sup M/-1 (M<or=L), and when M divides L the length of the modified Kasami sequences is 2/sup L/-1.

It utilizes a basic and proven property of Hopfield neural networks, i.e. the guaranteed convergence to a local minimum of the Lyapunov energy function. Unlike the previous methods, the new method estimates the in-phase and quadratic components separately and in a parallel manner and combines them to estimate the bearings of plane waves to an array. The connection parameters of the neural networks are calculated for both components with a significant reduction in computation in comparison with the previous methods. Furthermore, the new method is able to estimate the actual magnitude of each bearing component, rather than just its presence. This is accomplished by using the 1984 Hopfield model rather than the 1982 model, as opposed to the previous methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1990.138186","startPage":"440","endPage":"443","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

It simultaneously takes into account the shortest path and channel capacity and determines the necessary connections and weights of the neural network, thus providing an optimum transmission path from source node to destination node. The algorithm is based on the Hopfield type of neural network approach, and can be considered as a massively parallel distributed processing system with the ability to improve performance through dynamic learning. The power of neural network algorithms to solve routing problems and provide dynamic response to traffic conditions measured throughout the network system is investigated. No congestion occurs in this network because of the changes in the statistics of the input traffic load. A computer simulation result for a 10-node network shows the efficiency of using the neural network-based algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1990.138187","startPage":"444","endPage":"448","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

Most of these simulators do not take long-term environmental effects into account. These environmental effects on VLSI circuits are specifically more important for performance estimation in hostile environments such as high temperature and space radiation environments. The ICs designed for normal environments fail to function normally in these hostile environments. A study is made of the effects of one such environment, the space-radiation environment, on CMOS digital circuits, and methods for extending the operational life of a part by changing operating parameters, namely, operating frequency, are proposed. Although the study specifically concentrates on the space environment, the concept can be applied to any hostile environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1990.138199","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

This algorithm is based on a recently published fast one-dimensional DCT algorithm. The new algorithm is recursive, fast, and numerically stable. The two-dimensional decomposition in this new algorithm is based on the vector-radix approach. In this approach, the data matrix is partitioned into four subblocks, each of which, after some processing is transformed by a lower order DCT. The results from the lower order transforms are then combined to form the desired two-dimensional DCT. The overall complexity of the new transform is compared in terms of the number of multiplications and additions required to perform the two-dimensional DCT with those of a row/column implementation using the fast one-dimensional transform.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1990.138224","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings.

Thus, the linear span is a measure of the complexity of the sequence structure. A large complexity or linear span is desired for security of the sequence. The binary No sequence requires nonlinear connections in addition to the linear feedback shift registers. Thus, No sequences have a large complexity and are suited for high security systems. The implementation of Gold, Kasami, and No sequences which are directly applicable for CDMA are presented and compared for complexity. An alternative to the nonlinear connection of the linear feedback shift register for the No sequences is also presented.

These mechanisms perform a resource allocation function within such an architecture and are therefore critical to the real-time operation and performance of such an architecture. Dynamic process mapping mechanisms can be realized in hardware or software. It can be shown a hardware process mapping mechanism is faster than a functionally equivalent software process mapper. This paper presents a fast dynamic modular hardware process mapping mechanism for a real-time data-driven multiprocessor architecture, the dynamic pipeline computer architecture (DPCA), its organization and design suitable for VLSI implementation and a performance analysis. The basic process mapper design is modular and therefore may be utilized in parallel data-driven computer architectures. Process mapping time is shown to be proportional to O(log/sub 2/ N) where N represents the number of process mapping modules required within a token controlled data driven multiprocessor system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SSST.1991.138609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.1991.138609","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] The Twenty-Third Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","pdfPath":"/iel2/355/3753/00138609.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] The Twenty-Third Southeastern Symposium on System Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of a modular hardware process mapper (scheduler) for a real-time token controlled data driven multiprocessor architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of a modular hardware process mapper (scheduler) for a real-time token controlled data driven multiprocessor architecture","conferenceDate":"10-12 March 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4060983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/138609/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of a modular hardware process mapper (scheduler) for a real-time token controlled data driven multiprocessor architecture","confLoc":"Columbia, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"00138609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064203S","chronDate":"10-12 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"355","articleId":"138609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":138634,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The CC utilizes samples of distances defined from a major axis to points located on the boundary of the object image (sampled boundary distances, or SBDs). With this approach (CCSBD), the recognition of an object under translation, rotation, and uniform scaling can be achieved. The recognition of an object under stretching may also be achieved under the condition that the major axis of the image is not changed after transformation. The generalization of this approach is discussed. In particular, one of the generalizations is the use of axis of symmetry for symmetric images to measure SBDs. This can achieve recognition invariant under translation, rotation, uniform scaling, and stretching along the axis of symmetry and/or the direction perpendicular to it. The experimental results of using CCSBD to recognize some sampling objects are presented. The capability of recognizing objects under a certain type of nonaffine transformation using CCSBD is also investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Image recognition","Information science","Particle measurements","Image sampling","Length measurement","Neurons","Feature extraction","Cameras","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross correlation","sampled boundary distances","object recognition","sampled boundary distances","translation","rotation","uniform scaling","nonaffine transformation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSI.1990.138687","publicationTitle":"Systems Integration '90.

In this quantization, two different codebooks are used. The encoder selects the channel code pair that generates the smallest distortion between the input and the averaged output vectors.

Coding experiments show that the proposed scheme has almost the same SNR as a conventional vector quantizer for an error-free channel. On the other hand, it has a significantly higher SNR than the conventional one for a 1% error rate. This scheme also has merits in computational complexity and storage requirements.

Compounded images were formed using subapertures of varying size, shape, and overlap, and the speckle and resolution characteristics of the final images were observed. A pointlike scatterer was imaged to determine the resolution, point spread function, and sensitivity of the system along with a new measure called the resolution cell size. The response of the system was also simulated for comparisons. It was found that lateral resolution, and resolution cell sizes only gradually increased with a decrease in subaperture size and system sensitivity was not greatly diminished. Incoherent summation of signals from small groups of elements decreased the speckle noise by a factor of four while maintaining enough resolution to improve the image quality as measured by the CSR/d by a factor of almost two.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","volume":"39","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4191831","pubMedId":"18263133","displayDocTitle":"Speckle reduction in pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging using a two-dimensional receiving array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speckle reduction in pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging using a two-dimensional receiving array","sourcePdf":"00139111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04503S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"9","articleId":"139111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":139112,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

To study the potential effects of the bandwidth-limited behavior, a mathematical model was used. Several parameters of a simulated lithotripsy pulse were compared before and after being filtered by hydrophone and amplifier response functions. Errors were computed for the peak positive and negative pressures, risetime, pulse duration, and pulse intensity integral as functions of hydrophone and amplifier bandwidths. Although most of the energy in a shock wave pulse lies at frequencies below a few megahertz, it is found that significant errors can occur unless measurement bandwidths are much wider.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4191842","pubMedId":"18263144","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lithotripsy pulse measurement errors due to nonideal hydrophone and amplifier frequency responses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lithotripsy pulse measurement errors due to nonideal hydrophone and amplifier frequency responses","sourcePdf":"00139122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026328S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"10","articleId":"139122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":139123,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

To enhance the flaw visibility, a frequency diverse statistical filtering technique known as split-spectrum processing has been developed. This technique splits the received wideband signal into an ensemble of narrowband signals exhibiting different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Using a minimization algorithm, SNR enhancement can be obtained at the output. The nonlinear properties of the frequency diverse statistic filter are characterized based on the spectral histogram, which is the statistical distribution of the spectral windows selected by the minimization algorithm. The theoretical analysis indicates that the spectral histogram is similar in nature to the Wiener filter transfer function. Therefore, the optimal filter frequency region can be determined adaptively based on the spectral histogram without prior knowledge of the signal and noise spectra.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.139126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.139126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3763","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/3763/00139126.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139126","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Minimization methods","Signal to noise ratio","Wiener filter","Frequency diversity","Statistical distributions","Filtering","Wideband","Narrowband","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic filters","acoustic signal processing","adaptive filters","computerised signal processing","filtering and prediction theory","flaw detection","minimisation","spectral analysis","ultrasonic materials testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NDT","minimization algorithm","ultrasonic flaw detection","large grained materials","backscattered grain noise","flaw visibility","statistical filtering technique","split-spectrum processing","SNR enhancement","frequency diverse statistic filter","Wiener filter transfer function","optimal filter frequency region"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectral histogram using the minimization algorithm-theory and applications to flaw detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4191846","pubMedId":"18263148","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139126/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral histogram using the minimization algorithm-theory and applications to flaw detection","sourcePdf":"00139126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028269S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"29","articleId":"139126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":139139,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this approach, hidden Markov models (HMMs) for gain-normalized clean signals are designed using maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the gain contours of the clean training sequences. The models are combined with ML estimates of the gain contours of the clean test signals, obtained from the given clean or noisy signals, in performing recognition using the maximum a posteriori decision rule.

The need for such algorithms arises when the system model assigns an unequal number of delay elements to each input channel. All proposed schemes provide considerable improvements over overparametrization or the zero padding approach. First, a block-structures algorithm is derived. It operates on boxes, or blocks, whose dimensions successively increase until their size equals the number of input channels. As a result, it requires linear system solvers and matrix multiplications. The second algorithm manages to get free of block operations by proper decomposition of each block step involved in the first method into a number of scalar steps equal to the size of the block. The third and the fourth algorithms provide highly concurrent alternatives that reduce processing time by an order magnitude.

In addition to the complete derivation of the time-domain conditions, they also describe the associated filter bank design procedure and a number of design examples are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4212725","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain filter bank analysis: a new design theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain filter bank analysis: a new design theory","sourcePdf":"00139245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045342S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"134","articleId":"139245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":139253,"authors":[{"name":"H.B.

The main results presented are simple analytic expressions for the CR bound in terms of the maximum frequency separation, delta omega , SNR, and the number of data vectors, N, that are valid for small delta omega . The results are applicable to the conditional (deterministic) signal model. The results show that the CR bound on frequency estimates is proportional to ( delta omega )/sup -2(n-1)//N*SNR. Therefore, the bound increases rapidly as the signal separation is reduced. Examples indicate that the expressions closely approximate the exact CR bounds whenever the signal separation is smaller than one resolution cell. Based upon the results, it is argued that the threshold SNR at which an unbiased estimator can resolve n closely spaced signals is at least proportional to ( delta omega )/sup -2n//N. The results are quite general and apply to many different types of temporal and spatial sampling grids.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","volume":"40","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4212735","publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Cramer-Rao bound on frequency estimates of signals closely spaced in frequency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Cramer-Rao bound on frequency estimates of signals closely spaced in frequency","sourcePdf":"00139253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036087S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","articleId":"139253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":139255,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Computationally, the simplest of these is to approximate the desired time series sample by the available sample which is nearest in time. This procedure is variously known as sample-and-hold interpolation, zero-order polynomial interpolation, or selective subsampling. The effect of this approximation on signal-to-noise ratio has already been addressed in the literature. This correspondence extends those previous analyses by deriving the spectral characteristics of the noise generated. It is shown that, because the timing errors involved in zero-order polynomial interpolation are not random, the effect on the input spectrum is not simply to broaden it by the transfer of power from narrowband signal components to broadband noise, from narrowband signals to narrowband noise or distortion components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.139264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3770/00139264.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1579","doi":"10.1109/78.139264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral distortion in sampling rate conversion by zero-order polynomial interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Spectral distortion in sampling rate conversion by zero-order polynomial interpolation","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4212745","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral distortion in sampling rate conversion by zero-order polynomial interpolation","sourcePdf":"00139264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026983S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","articleId":"139264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":139266,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The states are observed via a multivariable probabilistic mapping, again assuming values in a Cartesian product of finite sets of observables. The CHMM can be reduced to an ordinary (i.e., scalar) HMM by conventional nonlinear techniques. The forms of the forward-backward algorithm which gives the fixed-interval smoothed maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of the states and the Viterbi algorithm which gives the MAP fixed-interval sequence are straightforward generalizations of the scalar case. Two applications of CHMMs in the area of frequency tracking are briefly indicated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cartesian hidden Markov models with applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.139272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3770/00139272.pdf","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.139272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Cartesian hidden Markov models with applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4212754","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cartesian hidden Markov models with applications","sourcePdf":"00139272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031659S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","articleId":"139272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":139286,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.H. de Groot","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"firstName":"S.M.H.","lastName":"de Groot","id":"37295581700"},{"name":"S.H.

The method is based on the scheduling-range chart, which contains the information on the range within which each operation in the graph can be scheduled. The scheduling range is determined by considering the intraiteration and interiteration precedence relations. The goal is to find an optimal position within the scheduling range of each operation in such a way that some quality criteria (number of hardware resources, iteration period, latency, register lifetime) are optimized. A formal proof of the NP-completeness of the problem is given and two polynomial-time heuristics are introduced: fixed-rate (rate-optimal as a special case) scheduling where the number of hardware resources is optimized at the same time that a specific iteration period is guaranteed, and maximum-throughput scheduling with limited resources where the iteration period is optimized for a fixed number of processors. The algorithms are able to find optimal solutions for well-known benchmark examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.139286","startPage":"351","endPage":"364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.139286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/3771/00139286.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range-chart-guided iterative data-flow graph scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139286/","displayDocTitle":"Range-chart-guided iterative data-flow graph scheduling","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4217050","publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-chart-guided iterative data-flow graph scheduling","sourcePdf":"00139286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04135S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"66","articleId":"139286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":139341,"authors":[{"name":"X.

These are used to evaluate the performance of a class of multiversion lock-based concurrency control algorithms in maintaining temporal consistency of data in a real-time shared-data environment. It is shown that it is easier for such a concurrency control algorithm to maintain temporal consistency of shared data when the conflicting transactions are close in the lengths of their periods. The conflict pattern of the transactions has a more significant effect on the temporal inconsistency of data than the load level of the system. It is also desirable to have the transactions' periods within a small range. The best case was obtained when the faster transactions have higher utilizations. It was also shown that the use of the priority inheritance principle with the lock-based concurrency control algorithms can reduce transactions' blocking times and the number of transactions that access temporally inconsistent data as well as the worst-case age and dispersion of data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPSAC.1990.139341","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., Fourteenth Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., Fourteenth Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/295/3772/00139341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPSAC.1990.139341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3772","startPage":"132","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multiversion concurrency control algorithms in maintaining temporal consistency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multiversion concurrency control algorithms in maintaining temporal consistency","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139341/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4012320","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multiversion concurrency control algorithms in maintaining temporal consistency","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00139341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026054S","chronDate":"31 Oct-2 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"295","citationCount":"35","articleId":"139341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":139350,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.

Most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed, along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation of each to any desired precision. This permits junctions to be localized without rounding.

A single pair of stereo images can yield surface reconstruction for only a small volume of space. Since the scene may be large, images are obtained dynamically using different camera configurations through the control of focus and camera vergence. For smooth objects, this results in the reconstruction of surface patches that are contiguous and overlapping. These sequentially acquired surface maps are merged into a central. composite representation. During camera reconfiguration, unpredictable calibration errors may arise. Therefore, this method permits small changes in calibration parameter values to achieve agreement between adjacent reconstructed patches in the areas of overlap. To integrate the different sources of depth information, and to balance the effects they have on the resulting surface estimate, the surface reconstruction problem is formulated as one of optimization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings Third International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/298/3773/00139576.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"492","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings Third International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1990.139576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1990.139576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active surface reconstruction by integrating focus, vergence, stereo, and camera calibration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Cameras","Calibration","Image reconstruction","Layout","Focusing","Stereo image processing","Lenses","State estimation","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","computer vision","computerised picture processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active surface reconstruction","surface estimation","focus","vergence","stereo","camera calibration","stereo images","surface patches","depth information","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Active surface reconstruction by integrating focus, vergence, stereo, and camera calibration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4111574","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active surface reconstruction by integrating focus, vergence, stereo, and camera calibration","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00139576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029793S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"298","citationCount":"22","articleId":"139576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":139583,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The first phase of the algorithm calculates three values: (1) the variation of inner product of illuminant direction and surface normal before and after motion, and (2) the variation of shading, as well as (3) the motion field. The second phase uses these values to recover not only object shape but also illuminant direction and reflection coefficients of the surface.

Distinct facial features correspond to convex regions of the range image of the face, which is obtained by a segmentation of the range image based on the sign of the mean and Gaussian curvature at each point. Each convex region is represented by its extended Gaussian image, a 1-1 mapping between points of the region and points on the unit sphere that have the same normal. Several issues are examined that are associated with the difficult problem of interpolation of the values of the extended Gaussian image and its representation. A similarity measure between two regions is obtained by correlating their extended Gaussian images. To establish the optimal correspondence, a graph matching algorithm is applied. It uses the correlation matrix between convex regions of the two faces and incorporates additional relational constraints that account for the relative spatial locations of the convex regions in the domain of the range image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1990.139627","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings Third International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings Third International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/298/3773/00139627.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1990.139627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3773","startPage":"722","endPage":"726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching range images of human faces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Matching range images of human faces","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139627/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4111601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching range images of human faces","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00139627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033735S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"298","citationCount":"116","articleId":"139627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":139628,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The authors consider the estimation of dynamic facial muscle contractions from video sequences of expressive human faces.

The stereo matching method uses multiple stereo pairs with different baselines generated by a lateral displacement of a camera. Matching is performed by computing the sum of squared-difference (SSD) values. The SSD functions for individual stereo pairs are represented with respect to the inverse depth (rather than the disparity, as is usually done), and then are simply added to produce the sum of SSDs. This resulting function is called the SSSD-in-inverse-depth. The authors define a stereo algorithm, based on the SSSD-in-inverse-depth and then present a mathematical analysis to show how the algorithm can remove ambiguity and increase precision.

It features passive sensing of the omnidirectional environment in real-time using a conic mirror. Because the conic mirror is used, its image is under conic projection; where the azimuth of each point in the scene appears in the image as its direction from the image center. The authors describe COPIS and its application to guide the navigation of a mobile robot. The COPIS system acquires an omnidirectional view around the robot in real-time by using a conic mirror. Under the assumption of constant motion of the robot, locations of objects around the robot can be estimated by detecting their azimuth changes in the omnidirectional image. Using this method, the robot generates an environmental map of an indoor scene while it is moving in the environment. A method to avoid collision against objects by detecting their azimuth changes is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1991.139681","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/340/3774/00139681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1991.139681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3774","startPage":"160","endPage":"165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time generation of environmental map and obstacle avoidance using omnidirectional image sensor with conic mirror","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time generation of environmental map and obstacle avoidance using omnidirectional image sensor with conic mirror","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139681/","conferenceDate":"3-6 June 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4132420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time generation of environmental map and obstacle avoidance using omnidirectional image sensor with conic mirror","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00139681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032755S","chronDate":"3-6 Jun 1991","isNumber":"3774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"340","citationCount":"26","articleId":"139681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":139691,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Their use can be seen as a tradeoff between two extreme strategies currently used in shape recognition: (invariant) feature extraction methods, involving high-order derivatives, and invariant coordinate descriptions, leading to the correspondence problem of reference points. The method for the derivation of such invariants, based on Lie group theory and applicable to a wide spectrum of transformation groups, is described. As an example, invariant curve parameterizations are developed for affine and projective transformations. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated with two examples: (1) recognition of a test set of 12 planar objects viewed under conditions allowing affine approximations, and (2) the detection of symmetry in perspective projections of curves.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1991.139735","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/340/3774/00139735.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1991.139735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition and semi-differential invariants","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139735/","displayDocTitle":"Recognition and semi-differential invariants","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4127734","conferenceDate":"3-6 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition and semi-differential invariants","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00139735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03001S","chronDate":"3-6 Jun 1991","isNumber":"3774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"340","citationCount":"37","articleId":"139735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":139750,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses.

A novel technique for the improvement of a given placement is presented which is based on the optimization of the channel densities by refining the cell positions. The authors introduce a distance function for each channel representing the channel width. This width can be altered by shifting adjacent cells along each other by an offset.

The method is based on a genetic algorithm, an iterative improvement procedure.

The I/O pad assignment is then used by placement tools. Experimental data show that as a result of using the I/O pad assignment procedure, the total interconnection length and circuit delay (after placement and routing) are reduced by 8-15% and 3-4%, respectively.

Unlike other symbolic processing architectures, this is based on a tag coprocessor (TC) which is designed to work in parallel with a conventional RISC CPU such as the MIPS R3000. The TC performs almost all the tag manipulation operations independently of the CPU. It can also perform stack height checking, range checking and loop control. This design significantly enhances the execution speed of symbolic languages such as Lisp and Prolog on a RISC processor, yet all existing software for the CPU without the TC will work with minimal modification. The simplicity of the TC architecture provides a cost-effective way of designing systems specifically for artificial intelligence applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tag coprocessor architecture for symbolic languages","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1991.139922","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/367/3775/00139922.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1991.139922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=139922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/139922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"A tag coprocessor architecture for symbolic languages","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4127998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tag coprocessor architecture for symbolic languages","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00139922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04143S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct 1991","isNumber":"3775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"367","articleId":"139922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":139952,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The advantage of such a system is that errors can be caught as soon as they occur, and thus data contamination is prevented. Although much effort has been concentrated on the design of self-checking checkers by previous researchers, very few results have been presented for the design of self-checking functional circuits, and fewer still for the design of self-checking systems.
