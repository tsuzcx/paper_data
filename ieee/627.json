This sensorless method is able to detect occurrence, location, direction, and severity of the eccentricity fault in SRM. First, the theory of the method is presented, and then its background formulation is explored and discussed. In order to model the eccentric SRM and apply the test method, a 3-D transient finite-element method (3-D TFEM) is employed, which takes into account all physical and geometrical characteristics of the motor components. Next, a test rig is established to carry out various measurements on a faulty motor with different degrees of eccentricity. Then, a procedure of diagnosis method with achieved data is described. In this regard, this method investigates how the fault location as well as the faulty phase in the SRM can be detected. Furthermore, the strategy of the fault direction detection based on induced voltage variations is stated. In addition, a proper index will be proposed in order to detect the fault severity. To demonstrate the merits of this indicator in the eccentricity detection and estimation of its severity, the correlation between the index and frequency and voltage variations are evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2012.2213606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6416962/06270004.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2012.2213606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6416962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless Method for Eccentricity Fault Monitoring and Diagnosis in Switched Reluctance Machines Based on Stator Voltage Signature","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270004/","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless Method for Eccentricity Fault Monitoring and Diagnosis in Switched Reluctance Machines Based on Stator Voltage Signature","volume":"49","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270004/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250214","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless Method for Eccentricity Fault Monitoring and Diagnosis in Switched Reluctance Machines Based on Stator Voltage Signature","sourcePdf":"tmag-torkaman-2213606-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063285S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6416962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6416962","articleId":"6270004","onlineDate":"16 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6270260,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Sun","affiliation":["School of Resource and Environmental Science, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ping Sun","id":"38469059200"},{"name":"Lei Deng","affiliation":["School of Resource and Environmental Science, Key Laboratory of Resources Environment and GIS, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Deng","id":"37531523200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1104-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1103-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1102-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-024X"}],"articleNumber":"6270260","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image fusion","image reconstruction","image resolution","image segmentation","remote sensing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region segmentation","wavelet transform","multiscale remote sensing image fusion","multiscale decomposition","area standard deviation","low-frequency coefficients","target information","background information","absolute value operator","gray error value operator","high-frequency coefficients","image definition","fused coefficient reconstruction","spectrum information","multispectral image","image resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["region segmentation","wavelet transform","image fusion","image interpretation"]}],"abstract":"An image fusion method based on region segmentation and wavelet transform for multi-scale remote sensing image fusion is proposed.

Accessing the locations of events or determining the locations of mobile nodes is one of basic functions of wireless sensor networks. Except for normal information, sensor nodes should also provide position information of sensor nodes. So it's necessary to have a reliable algorithm for localization. Using GPS (Global Position System) technology is a good way to fix position in many fields, and high precision and performance could be obtained in outdoor environment. However, high energy consumption and device volume make it not proper for the low cost self-organizing sensor networks. Some researchers used Monte-Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithm in mobile nodes localization, and revealed that better localization effects could be obtained. However, current MCL-based approaches need to acquire a large number of samples to calculate to achieve good precision. The energy of one node is limited and can't last for a long time. In this paper, a new method has been suggested to apply genetic algorithm to improve MCL in MSNs for localization. Experimental results illustrate that our methodology has a better performance in comparison with Monte Carlo localization algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/Geoinformatics.2012.6270264","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261988/6270256/06270264.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 20th International Conference on Geoinformatics","publicationTitle":"2012 20th International Conference on Geoinformatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Geoinformatics.2012.6270264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Monte Carlo Localization algorithm using genetic algorithm in mobile WSNs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving Monte Carlo Localization algorithm using genetic algorithm in mobile WSNs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12945341","publicationDate":"June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6270264/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Monte Carlo Localization algorithm using genetic algorithm in mobile WSNs","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066859S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261988","isNumber":"6270256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261988","xplore-issue":"6270256","articleId":"6270264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6270390,"authors":[{"name":"Koushik Maharatna","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Koushik","lastName":"Maharatna","id":"37276961600"},{"name":"Evangelos B.

The new parallel hardware like GPU can provide multi-thread processing and very high floating-point capability. We take advantage of GPU to accelerate a popular HMM-based Speech Recognition package - HTK. Based on the sequential code of HTK, we design the \"paraTraining\", a parallel training model in HTK and develop different optimization methods to improve the performance of HTK on GPU which include unrolling the nested loops and using \"reduction add\" which can maximize the number of threads per block, using warp mechanism of GPU to reduce synchronizing latency, building different indices of threads to address data efficiently. Experimental results show that about 20+ speedup can be achieved without loss in accuracy. We also discuss the implementation of our method on multi-GPU and got around two times speedup compared with on single-GPU.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12947625","htmlLink":"/document/6270395/","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the Training of HTK on GPU with CUDA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the Training of HTK on GPU with CUDA","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05832S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6270400,"authors":[{"name":"Nam Ma","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nam","lastName":"Ma","id":"37894115700"},{"name":"Yinglong Xia","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

OLAP utilizes the efficient multidimensional data structure referred to as the OLAP cube to answer multi-faceted analytical queries. As queries become more complex and the dimensionality and size of the cube grows, the processing time required to aggregate queries increases. In this paper, we are proposing: (1) a parallel implementation of MOLAP cube using OpenMP, (2) a text-to-integer translation method to allow effective string processing on GPU, and (3) a new scheduling algorithm that support these new features. To be able to process string queries on the GPU, we are introducing a text-to-integer translation method which works with multiple dictionaries. The translation is necessary only for the GPU side of the system. To support the translation and parallel CPU implementation, a new scheduling algorithm is proposed. The scheduler divides multi-core processor(s) of a shared memory system into a processing partition and a preprocessing (or translation) partition. The performance of the new system is evaluated. The text-to-integer translation adds a new vital functionality to our system, however it also slows down the GPU processing by 7% when compare to original implementation without string support. The performance measurements indicate that due to the parallel implementation, the processing rate of the CPU partition improves from 12 to 110 queries per second. Moreover, the CPU partition is now able to process OLAP cubes of size 32 GB at rate of 11 queries per second. The total performance of the entire hybrid system (CPU + GPU) increased from 102 to 228 queries per second.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.259","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.259","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270406.pdf","startPage":"1987","endPage":"1996","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Scheduling for GPU Accelerated Hybrid OLAP Systems with Multi-core Support and Text-to-Integer Translation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Task Scheduling for GPU Accelerated Hybrid OLAP Systems with Multi-core Support and Text-to-Integer Translation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947635","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6270406/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Scheduling for GPU Accelerated Hybrid OLAP Systems with Multi-core Support and Text-to-Integer Translation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079479S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6270473,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Information Center, Chinese Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468738000"},{"name":"Sheng Tao","affiliation":["Information Center, Chinese Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Tao","id":"38468771800"},{"name":"Liyong Liu","affiliation":["Information Center, Chinese Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liyong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38468884500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0911-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0910-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8480"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8464"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-8464"}],"articleNumber":"6270473","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270473","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Probes","Mathematical model","Dynamic range","Materials","Equations","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier density","optical hole burning","optical modulation","optical pumping","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrafast phase dynamics","bulk semiconductor optical amplifiers","spectral hole burning","carrier heating","carrier density modulation","longitudinal nonuniformity","SOA","probe wavelength","pump wavelength","SHB","CH","change direction","phase recovery overshoot","phase partial recovery time","pump spectral positions","probe spectral positions"]}],"abstract":"Accounting for spectral hole burning (SHB), carrier heating (CH), carrier density modulation and longitudinal nonuniformity, ultrafast phase dynamics in bulk semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is numerically studied for different pump and probe wavelengths.

The image is split into non-overlapping blocks of fixed size, which are independently represented by compressive sensing in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. The key idea is to assign more sensing resources to the image blocks with rich edge and texture features but less to the image blocks located at smooth regions. Simulation results for standard compression test images demonstrate that the proposed scheme can get significant performance gain in reducing measurement rate and/or enhancing reconstructed image quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6270008/6270417/06270475.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics","doi":"10.1109/SOPO.2012.6270475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOPO.2012.6270475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative Sparsity Estimation Based Compressive Sensing for Image Compression Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Compressed sensing","Discrete cosine transforms","Image reconstruction","Estimation","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","estimation theory","image coding","image reconstruction","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relative sparsity estimation","image compression applications","sparse signal acquisition","block-based compressive sensing","image chunks","discrete cosine transform","DCT domain","image reconstruction","image quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Relative Sparsity Estimation Based Compressive Sensing for Image Compression Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270475/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947995","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative Sparsity Estimation Based Compressive Sensing for Image Compression Applications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"pid1112208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072566S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6270008","isNumber":"6270417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6270008","xplore-issue":"6270417","articleId":"6270475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6270477,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Information Center, Chinese Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468738000"},{"name":"Sheng Tao","affiliation":["Information Center, Chinese Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Tao","id":"38468771800"},{"name":"Liyong Liu","affiliation":["Information Center, Chinese Academy of Transportation Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liyong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38468884500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0911-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0910-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8480"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8464"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-8464"}],"articleNumber":"6270477","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Mathematical model","Equations","Materials","Charge carrier density","High speed optical techniques","Optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier density","high-speed optical techniques","optical hole burning","optical modulation","optical pumping","semiconductor optical amplifiers","transparency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["picosecond gain recovery dynamics","semiconductor optical amplifiers","density matrix equations","broad-band time-domain large-signal model","spectral hole burning","carrier heating","carrier density modulation","SOA","pump pulse","picosecond timescale","ultrafast component","three-wavelength devices","long-lived recovery tail","CDM","continuous-wave assistant light","gain transparency point","gain recovery time","time 1 ps"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270477","abstract":"Based on density matrix equations, a broad-band time-domain large-signal model for semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is established.

In order to solve the problem, based on intelligent optimal theory of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, we propose a strategy PSO-GODSS (global optimization of dynamic Web service selection based on PSO) algorithm to implement Web service selection with QoS global optimization. The basic idea of the algorithm is to transform the original Web service selection problem into a multi-objective services composition optimization problem with global QoS constraints, which is further transformed into a single-objective problem by using the method of ideal point. Then, the theory of intelligent optimization of PSO is applied to produce a set of optimal services composition process with QoS constraints. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm, and the execution efficiency and convergence rate of PSO-GODSS are much better than that of multi-objective genetic algorithm used in prior work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270594/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12947671","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270594/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Effective Dynamic Web Service Selection Strategy with Global Optimal QoS Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Dynamic Web Service Selection Strategy with Global Optimal QoS Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676c280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066505S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6270600,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Wu","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Wu","id":"38240950000"},{"name":"Ming Chao Wang","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ming Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468699100"},{"name":"Wu Zhang","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278435100"},{"name":"Yike Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yike","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270600","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":598},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Pricing","Computational modeling","Graphics","Memory management","Educational institutions","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pricing strategy","Iaas","cloud computing","resources as a service","software as a service","platform as a service","infrastructure as a service","desktop PC","data center","pay-as-you-go service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud program","cloud computing","pricing","pay-as-you-go","Iaas"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is the latest technology trend in delivering computing resources as a service. In practice, cloud service providers tend to offer services that can be grouped into three categories: software as a service (Saas), platform as a service (Paas) and infrastructure as a service (Iaas). Iaas is the delivery of hardware (server, storage and network) as a service. Cloud computing moves computations and data away from desktop PCs into large data centers. Traditional programs cannot bridge the separation between the possession and ownership of program from its use. To address this issue, cloud program with a pricing strategy for Iaas is proposed for cloud computing.

To take advantage of many-core CMPs, applications must be parallelized. However, due to the nature of algorithm/programming model, some parts of the application would remain serial. According to Amdahl's law, the speedup of a parallel application is limited by the amount of serial execution it has. For a CMP with many cores, this can be a serious limitation. To take full advantage of the increasing number of cores, one must try to reduce the execution time of the serial portion of a parallel program. However, rewriting an application takes time and often the return on the effort invested may not justify parallelizing every part of the program. Heterogeneous many-core CMP design is one possible solution to support massive parallel execution and to provide a reasonable single-thread performance. In this paper, we use a simple spreadsheet model to evaluate homogeneous and heterogeneous CMP designs using execution profiles of real HPC applications. Evaluated on 12 parallel HPC applications, we show that heterogeneous CMPs can outperform homogeneous CMPs by up to 1.35\u00d7 with an average speedup of 1.06\u00d7 when both the heterogeneous CMPs and homogeneous CMPs are constrained to use the same power budget. Our study found the heterogeneous CMPs can take advantage of serial portion of execution that is as little as 2% of total run time to provide performance benefit. This suggests heterogeneous computing can help mitigate the effect of not parallelizing some portions of an application due to return on investment concern on programming efforts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947695","htmlLink":"/document/6270624/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Benefits of Heterogeneous Computing in HPC Workloads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Benefits of Heterogeneous Computing in HPC Workloads","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12251S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6270625,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulla M.

Many of these data centers experience physical limitations on the power needed to run the data center. This paper attempts to maximize the performance of a data center that is subject to total power consumption and thermal constraints. We consider a power model for a data center that includes power consumed in both Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units and compute nodes. Our approach quantifies the performance of the data center as the total reward collected from completing tasks in a workload by their individual deadlines. We develop novel optimization techniques for assigning the performance states of compute cores at the data center level to increase the performance of the data center. The assignment problem in this paper is thermal aware as it considers the temperature evolution effects of performance state assignments, which in turn affects the power consumed by the CRAC units. Our simulation studies show that in some cases the assignment technique used in this paper achieves about 10% average improvement in the performance of a data center over an assignment problem that only considers putting a compute core in the performance state with the highest performance or turning the core off.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.19","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270625.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-Aware Performance Optimization in Power Constrained Heterogenous Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-Aware Performance Optimization in Power Constrained Heterogenous Data Centers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947696","htmlLink":"/document/6270625/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-Aware Performance Optimization in Power Constrained Heterogenous Data Centers","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083377S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6270631,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38468719500"},{"name":"Rizos Sakellariou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Rizos","lastName":"Sakellariou","id":"37267308300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270631","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270631","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Processor scheduling","Stochastic processes","Scheduling","Monte Carlo methods","Random variables","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","distributed processing","Monte Carlo methods","scheduling","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte-Carlo approach","full-ahead stochastic DAG scheduling","heterogeneous computing systems","static DAG scheduling approach","task execution times","classic static scheduling heuristic","average application performance","directed acyclic graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directed Acyclic Graph","full-ahead scheduling","DAG scheduling","monte-carlo methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.8","endPage":"112","startPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270631.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Monte-Carlo Approach for Full-Ahead Stochastic DAG Scheduling","abstract":"In most heterogeneous computing systems, there is a need for solutions that can cope with the unavoidable uncertainty in individual task execution times, when scheduling DAGs. When such uncertainties occur, static DAG scheduling approaches may suffer, and some rescheduling may be necessary. Assuming that the uncertainty in task execution times is modelled in a stochastic manner, then we may be able to use this information to improve static DAG scheduling considerably. In this paper, a novel DAG scheduling approach is proposed to solve this stochastic scheduling problem, based on a Monte-Carlo method. The approach is built on the top of a classic static scheduling heuristic and evaluated through extensive simulation. Empirical results show that a significant improvement on average application performance can be achieved by the proposed approach at a reasonable execution time cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270631/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270631/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12947702","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Monte-Carlo Approach for Full-Ahead Stochastic DAG Scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Monte-Carlo Approach for Full-Ahead Stochastic DAG Scheduling","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089137S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6270634,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6269389/6270391/6270634/6270634-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Wu received his Master degree in Computer Science from the National University of Defense Technology, China, in 2009.

To ensure an acceptable level of statistical accuracy relatively large number of particles are needed, which calls for high performance implementations of MD. These days heterogeneous systems, with their high performance potential, low power consumption, and high price-performance ratio, offer a viable alternative for running MD simulations. In this paper we introduce a fast parallel implementation of MD simulation with the Morse potential on Tianhe-1A, a petascale heterogeneous supercomputer. Our code achieves a speedup of 3.6\u00d7 on one NVIDIA Tesla M2050 GPU (containing 14 Streaming Multiprocessors) compared to a 2.93GHz six-core Intel Xeon X5670 CPU. In addition, our code runs faster on 1024 compute nodes (with two CPUs and one GPU inside a node) than on 4096 GPU-excluded nodes, effectively rendering one GPU more efficient than six six-core CPUs. Our work shows that large-scale MD simulations can benefit enormously from GPU acceleration in petascale supercomputing platforms. Our performance results are achieved by using (1) a patch-cell design to exploit parallelism across the simulation domain, (2) a new GPU kernel developed by taking advantage of Newton's Third Law to reduce redundant force computation on GPUs, (3) two optimization methods including a dynamic load balancing strategy that adjusts the workload, and a communication overlapping method to overlap the communications between CPUs and GPUs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Parallel Implementation of Molecular Dynamics with the Morse Potential on a Heterogeneous Petascale Supercomputer","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270634.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Parallel Implementation of Molecular Dynamics with the Morse Potential on a Heterogeneous Petascale Supercomputer","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270634/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947705","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Parallel Implementation of Molecular Dynamics with the Morse Potential on a Heterogeneous Petascale Supercomputer","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079036S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6270637,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Kegel","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Philipp Kegel","Philipp Kegel has been a PhD student at the University of Muenster (Germany) since 2008.

In this paper, we presentd OpenCL (Distributed OpenCL) - a uniform approach to programming distributed heterogeneous systems with accelerators. d OpenCL extends the OpenCL standard, such that arbitrary computing devices installed on any node of a distributed system can be used together within a single application. OpenCL allows moving data and program code to these devices in a transparent, portable manner. Sinced OpenCL is designed as a fully-fledged implementation of the OpenCL API, it allows running existing OpenCL applications in a heterogeneous distributed environment without any modifications. We describe in detail the mechanisms that are required to implement OpenCL for distributed systems, including a device management mechanism for running multiple applications concurrently. Using three application studies, we compare the performance of dOpenCL with MPI+OpenCL and a standard OpenCL implementation.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.16","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270637.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"dOpenCL: Towards a Uniform Programming Approach for Distributed Heterogeneous Multi-/Many-Core Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"dOpenCL: Towards a Uniform Programming Approach for Distributed Heterogeneous Multi-/Many-Core Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12947708","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270637/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"dOpenCL: Towards a Uniform Programming Approach for Distributed Heterogeneous Multi-/Many-Core Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061629S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6270639,"authors":[{"name":"Florina M.

A dual-stage framework is proposed in this paper to evaluate the robustness of efficient resource allocation and dynamic load balancing of scientific applications in heterogeneous computing environments with uncertain availability. The first stage employs robust resource allocation heuristics, while the second stage incorporates robust dynamic loop scheduling techniques. The combined dual-stage framework constitutes a comprehensive framework that enables and provides guarantees for the robust execution of scientific applications in computing systems where uncertainty is caused by various unpredictable perturbations. The paper reports on studies for determining the best techniques to be used for each stage that: (a) maximize the probability that the system make span satisfies a deadline, and (b) minimize the system make span for every given availability level in the system. The usefulness and benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated via a small scale example.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.5","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270639.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Dual-stage Framework for Robust Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Heterogeneous Environments with Uncertain Availability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Dual-stage Framework for Robust Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Heterogeneous Environments with Uncertain Availability","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947710","htmlLink":"/document/6270639/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Dual-stage Framework for Robust Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Heterogeneous Environments with Uncertain Availability","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088602S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6270641,"authors":[{"name":"Kazutaka Ikegami","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazutaka","lastName":"Ikegami","id":"38018245600"},{"name":"Keiko Abe","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiko","lastName":"Abe","id":"37290923400"},{"name":"Kumiko Nomura","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kumiko","lastName":"Nomura","id":"37299266100"},{"name":"Shinichi Yasuda","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"Yasuda","id":"37391644500"},{"name":"Masato Oda","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Oda","id":"37085464247"},{"name":"Shinobu Fujita","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37275893200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270641","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Nonvolatile Reconfigurable Switch-based FPGA through Overall Circuit Performance Evaluation","abstract":"As the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) scaling become harder, researchers have been trying to improve field programmable gate array (FPGA) performance by utilizing nonvolatile memory devices. This paper reports on a novel FPGA architecture where nonvolatile memory devices are used as nonvolatile reconfigurable switches (NRSs). It has found that resistive change memory (RCM) can be utilized as idealistic NRSs. To evaluate future performance of FPGA, we established evaluation method of interconnect circuit from international technology roadmap for semiconductor (ITRS) forecast. From FPGA scale evaluation, we show that there are two important design factor which affects overall FPGA performance, nonvolatile memory device characteristics and logic block cluster size. In terms of nonvolatile memory device characteristics, we have shown that the memory device whose resistivity of low resistance state (LRS) is around 10 kW gives superior performance by analysis of area and delay tradeoff. In terms of cluster size, larger cluster size is better for NRS-based FPGA since it can utilize small local programmable interconnect circuit composed of nonvolatile memory devices. From quantitative evaluation, area, delay and power of NRS-based FPGA can be improved by 25%, 24%, 29% compared to CMOS-based FPGA for 21 nm technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delay","Multiplexing","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","CMOS memory circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","logic design","performance evaluation","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile reconfigurable switch-based FPGA designing","circuit performance evaluation","complementary metal oxide semiconductor scaling","CMOS scaling","field programmable gate array performance","nonvolatile memory devices","international technology roadmap for semiconductor forecast","ITRS forecast","logic block cluster size","low resistance state","LRS","NRS-based FPGA","local programmable interconnect circuit","CMOS-based FPGA","size 21 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonvolatile memory","resistive change memory","reconfigurable logic","benchmark"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270641","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.22","startPage":"213","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270641.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.22","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270641/","displayDocTitle":"Designing Nonvolatile Reconfigurable Switch-based FPGA through Overall Circuit Performance Evaluation","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12947711","htmlLink":"/document/6270641/","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Nonvolatile Reconfigurable Switch-based FPGA through Overall Circuit Performance Evaluation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102193S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6270642,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ting Loke","affiliation":["Xilinx Asia Pacific, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei Ting","lastName":"Loke","id":"37969503600"},{"name":"Yajun Ha","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yajun","lastName":"Ha","id":"37391682500"},{"name":"Wenfeng Zhao","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wenfeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38468654600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270642","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Optimization","Switches","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power technology mapping","cluster-aware technology mapping","dual FPGA","clustering tool","leakage power reduction","programmable dual logic blocks","reverse back bias circuit techniques","RBB circuit techniques","deep submicron process technologies","Alters Stratix line","two-stage technology mapping tool","RBBMap tool","logic block packing tool","RBBPack tool","post-P&R method","RBB optimizations","baseline technology mapping tool","Emap","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Programmable-VT","Dual-VT","Reverse Back Bias","Technology Mapping","EDA","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a technology mapping and clustering tool for leakage power reduction in FPGAs with programmable, dual-VT logic blocks.

FPGAs with the ability to adjust fabric VT through RBB offer the potential of reducing leakage power with minimal or no sacrifice to circuit speed. Today, Altera's Stratix line of FPGAs deploy a similar strategy, but with optimizations limited to the post-P&R stage. We present a novel two-stage technology mapping (RBBMap) and logic block packing (RBBPack) tool that is free from clustering constraints limiting the post-P&R method, and moves RBB optimizations upwards to the technology mapping level.

This paper presents a solution able to combine the online placement of cores with the runtime bit streams relocation to implement a complete solution that can be used in conjunction with the runtime self reconfiguration. The validation phase presents the results obtained in placement management and relocation, compared to the results obtained by the state of art solutions to this problem.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.41","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270660.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Relocation Manager to Speedup Core Allocation in FPGA-based Reconfigurable Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270660/","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Relocation Manager to Speedup Core Allocation in FPGA-based Reconfigurable Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947729","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270660/","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Relocation Manager to Speedup Core Allocation in FPGA-based Reconfigurable Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a336.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06947S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6270663,"authors":[{"name":"Thilan Ganegedara","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thilan","lastName":"Ganegedara","id":"37712753600"},{"name":"Viktor K.

These advancements have made great impact on the conventional Internet infrastructure where networking equipment is dedicated on a per network basis. Router virtualization allows a single hardware router to serve packets from multiple networks while ensuring the same throughput and Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed originally. In this paper, we study the effect of router virtualization, from a power consumption perspective, on the widely used Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. An analytical model is proposed to estimate Layer-3 power consumption under different virtual router configurations. The analytical model is verified using post place-and-route results obtained using state-of-the-art FPGA and the models stand accurate with only a \u00b13% maximum error. Low power FPGA families are explored in this work to highlight the benefits of using such platforms in networking environments. Our experimental results show that by virtualizing, power savings proportional to the number of virtual networks can be achieved compared with non-virtualized routers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based Router Virtualization: A Power Perspective","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.44","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270663.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Router Virtualization: A Power Perspective","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270663/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947732","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Router Virtualization: A Power Perspective","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059223S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6270665,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Kumar Jaiswal","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Manish Kumar","lastName":"Jaiswal","id":"37648457900"},{"name":"Ray C.C.

In this paper, we present an implementation of a 512 x 36 SRAM-based TCAM (SR-TCAM) on a Virtex-5 FPGA, which is the strength of SR-TCAM because currently classical TCAMs cannot be implemented on FPGA. We have used two synthesis optimizations (BRAM-AUTO and BRAM = BLOCK_POWER2) using BRAMs on FPGA. Thus, user can choose design parameters that are suitable for his application. The power data has been measured using Xilinx X-Power by using activities for search operations of SR-TCAM. We have computed power consumption by taking the average of 1000 search operations with 100 MHz clock speed to have better power estimation, which results, for one of the design, in an average power consumption of 2.11 mW. SR-TCAM exploits dense SRAM and achieves comparable search performance in two clock cycles. Thus, SR-TCAM is a feasible and practical alternative to traditional CAMs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","optimisation","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","SRAM-based ternary content addressable memory","content addressable memory","SRAM-based TCAM","SR-TCAM","Virtex-5 FPGA","optimization synthesis","BRAM-AUTO","Xilinx X-Power","power consumption","search operations","clock speed","power estimation","frequency 100 MHz","power 2.11 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content Addressable Memroy (CAM)","Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM)","Potential Matching Address (PMA)","Matching Address (MA)","Vertical Partitioning (VP)","SRAM","Power Consumption","FPGA","Latency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270666","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.47","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270666.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.47","startPage":"383","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of SRAM-based Ternary Content Addressable Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of SRAM-based Ternary Content Addressable Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270666/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270666/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947735","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of SRAM-based Ternary Content Addressable Memory","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12962S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6270668,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic Hillenbrand","affiliation":["KIT -

The aim is to design the hardware architecture of an intelligent controller for a robot that exhibits several behaviors such as landscape learning, obstacle avoidance, path planning, sensory-motor control. The concerned robot evolves in an indoor unknown environment and uses the visual informations coming from its input sensors to reach its goal. The Embodied Computing approach presented in this paper is employed in this context to integrate the reconfiguration management as a part of the behavior of the global system. Thus the controller will be able to self-organize its reconfigurable processing elements in order to adapt its architecture to the environment and to the robot actions. We propose in this paper a hardware implementation of the approach based on artificial neural networks.

They provide programmers with useful APIs, but the APIs are still low level primitives. Therefore, in order to apply communication optimization techniques, such as double buffering techniques, programmers have to manually write the programs with the primitives. Manual communication optimization requires programmers to have significant knowledge of both application characteristics and CPU-accelerator architecture. This prevents many application developers from effective utilization of accelerators. In addition, managing communication is a tedious and error-prone task even for expert programmers. Thus, it is necessary to develop a communication system which is highly abstracted but still capable of optimization. For this purpose, this paper proposes an OpenCL based communication library. To maximize performance improvement, the proposed library provides a simple but effective programming interface based on Stream Graph in order to specify an applications communication pattern.

The important and prerequisite step of most NGS applications is the mapping of short sequences, called reads, to the template reference sequences. Both the explosion of NGS data with over billions of reads generated each day and the data intensive computations pose great challenges to the capability of existing computing systems. In this paper, we take a hash index based algorithm (PerM) as an example to investigate the optimization approaches for accelerating NGS reads mapping on multi-core architectures. First, we propose a new parallel algorithm that reorders bucket access in hash index among multiple threads so that data locality in shared cache is improved. Second, in order to reduce the number of empty hash bucket, we propose a serialized hash index compression algorithm, which coincides with the sequential access nature of our new parallel algorithm. With reduced hash index size, it also becomes possible for us to use longer hash keys, which alleviates the hash conflicts and improves the query performance. Our experiment on an 8-socket 8-cores Intel Xeon X7550 SMP with 128 GB memory shows that the new parallel algorithm reduces LLC miss ratio to be 8%~15% of the original algorithm and the overall performance is improved by 4~11 times (6 times avg.).","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.83","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD

While programming of these computers is provably easy, there is still room for improvement since they make implementing time-shared multitasking expensive, sometimes replicate much of the execution unnecessarily, and force a programmer to use looping and conditional control primitives in the case the application parallelism does not match the hardware parallelism. Thick Control Flow (TCF) is a parallel programming model that does not provide a fixed number of threads like PRAM-NUMA but a number of control flows that have certain thickness that can vary according to needs of the application catching the best parts of the dynamicism and generality of the original unbounded PRAM model and simplicity of the Single Instruction Stream Multiple Data Streams (SIMD) model.

Two approaches were proposed to achieve the desired target. First approach is an off-line scheduling scheme where core voltage and frequency are set up beforehand based on the workload characterization of the application. The second approach is an on-line scheduling scheme, where core voltage and frequency are controlled based on a workload detection algorithm. Experiments were conducted using the 48-core Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC), running a parallelized Fire Spread Monte Carlo Simulation program. Both schemes were compared against a performance-driven, but non-power-aware management scheme. The results indicate that our schemes are able to reduce the power consumption up to 29\\% with mild impact on the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.122","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270747.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Schemes via Workload Characterization on the Intel's Single-Chip Cloud Computer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270747/","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Schemes via Workload Characterization on the Intel's Single-Chip Cloud Computer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947810","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270747/","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient Schemes via Workload Characterization on the Intel's Single-Chip Cloud Computer","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676a999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08481S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6270756,"authors":[{"name":"Uwe Schwiegelshohn","affiliation":["Robotics Research Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Schwiegelshohn","id":"37282270700"},{"name":"Andrei Tchernykh","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, CICESE Research Center, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Tchernykh","id":"37282550900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270756","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Scheduling","Processor scheduling","Real time systems","Upper bound","Computational modeling","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","parallel machines","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online scheduling","cloud computing","service level","infrastructure as a service","IaaS","slack factor","competitive analysis","single machine model","parallel identical machines model","competitive factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["online scheduling","competitive factors","service levels","cloud computing","slack factor"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address scheduling problems for infrastructure as a service (IaaS). In a typical IaaS scenario, an infrastructure provider offers his resources on demand and with different service levels to his customers. These service levels are mainly distinguished by the amount of computing power a customer is guaranteed to receive within a time frame. In our a model, each service level is described by a slack factor and a price for a processing time unit. If the provider accepts a job it is guaranteed to complete by its deadline, that is its submission time plus its processing time times the slack factor of assigned service level. After a job has been submitted, the provider must decide immediately and irrevocably whether he accepts or rejects the job. We suggest various algorithms and use competitive analysis to discuss different scenarios for this model. These scenarios combine fixed services levels with the single machine model or the parallel identical machines model. Particularly, we demonstrate the benefit of parallelism by showing that we can achieve better competitive factor in a parallel machine scenario than in the corresponding single machine scenario.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.130","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270756.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Scheduling for Cloud Computing and Different Service Levels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270756/","displayDocTitle":"Online Scheduling for Cloud Computing and Different Service Levels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947818","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270756/","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Scheduling for Cloud Computing and Different Service Levels","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072737S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6270759,"authors":[{"name":"Yufei Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yufei","lastName":"Ren","id":"38469032800"},{"name":"Tan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Li","id":"38469008400"},{"name":"Dantong Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dantong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37276390400"},{"name":"Shudong Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shudong","lastName":"Jin","id":"38468420300"},{"name":"Thomas Robertazzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Robertazzi","id":"37284420700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270759","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Middleware","Protocols","Servers","Semantics","Message systems","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cloud computing","middleware","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware support","RDMA-based data transfer","high-speed data transfer","data-intensive application","cloud computing system","middleware layer","high-speed communication","remote direct memory access","HTTP","file copy","sync file I/O","remote file I/O","end-to-end bandwidth","high-speed architecture","resource abstraction","task synchronization","scheduling","file-transfer protocol","RDMA based middleware","TCP-based FTP tool","GridFTP","CPU consumption","line-speed performance","LAN","MAN","Ethernet","InfiniBand environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Center Networks","Middleware","Remote Direct Memory Access","Protocol offloading"]}],"abstract":"Providing high-speed data transfer is vital to various data-intensive applications in cloud computing systems. We design a middleware layer of high-speed communication based on Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) that serves as the common substrate to accelerate various data transfer applications in cloud computing, such as FTP, HTTP, file copy, sync and remote file I/O. This middleware offers higher end-to-end bandwidth than the traditional TCP-based alternatives, while it hides the heterogeneity of the underlying high-speed architecture. In this paper, we describe the design of this middleware, including resource abstraction, and task synchronization and scheduling. We provide a reference implementation of the file-transfer protocol over this RDMA based middleware. Our experimental results show that it outperforms several TCP-based FTP tools, such as GridFTP, while maintaining very low CPU consumption on a variety of platforms. Furthermore, these results confirm that our middleware achieves near line-speed performance in both LAN and MAN, and scales consistently from 10Gbps Ethernet to 40Gbps Ethernet and InfiniBand environments.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.133","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270759.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Middleware Support for RDMA-based Data Transfer in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Middleware Support for RDMA-based Data Transfer in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270759/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947820","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6270759/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Middleware Support for RDMA-based Data Transfer in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060889S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6270767,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Banikazemi","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

In addition to the potential decrease in cost and/or capacity, the nonvolatility of data stored in them is opening new doors to improved performance and new capabilities in a wide range of applications. In this paper we address issues involved in providing the software support for effective use of such memory systems. In particular, we discuss the API to be used for accessing persistent memory and propose a novel scheme to provide atomic and in order memory access. Insuring that memory access are performed in order and if need be atomically has turned out to be a significant challenge in the presence of one or more levels of volatile caches. The solutions offered to this date either require disabling caching, significant changes in the hardware, or frequent use of cache flushes and memory fences. All these requirements have a significant impact on the system performance. In contrast, Eucalyptus presented in paper is a software only solution which relaxes these requirements by separating consistency and persistency of data. Preliminary results obtained from our prototype are presented as well.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.138","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Eucalyptus: Support for Effective Use of Persistent Memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270767/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12947827","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eucalyptus: Support for Effective Use of Persistent Memory","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047152S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6270776,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

However, there are several new security challenges. In fact, anonymous password authentication in the traditional setting has been suffered from many inherent drawbacks such as ease of exposure to malicious attacks and users registered their passwords in the server. Our scheme proposes the phenomenal context according to three main components: data owner, users, and service provider in cloud where users do not need to register their passwords in the service provider. Moreover, the data owner is contributed to make secure decisions, so that he manages the significant keys to other components distributedly. The proposal enjoys several advantages such as preserving privacy of password, unlink ability, and secrecy of session key. We have given a mechanism to prove the identity of the users authenticated without a need to reveal their passwords. Our approach has been achieved good results of reliability, and validity for cloud password authentication. The experimental results show an effective level of performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270776.pdf","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1217","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Privacy-preserving Password Authentication Scheme for Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Servers","Encryption","Privacy","Dictionaries","Zinc"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving password authentication","cloud computing","security challenges","anonymous password authentication","session key secrecy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud authentication","zero-knowledge proof","service provider","password authentication","privacy-preserving"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Privacy-preserving Password Authentication Scheme for Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270776/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947835","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Privacy-preserving Password Authentication Scheme for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081942S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6270782,"authors":[{"name":"Chaolong Yu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chaolong","lastName":"Yu","id":"38468570300"},{"name":"Wenzhong Guo","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wenzhong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37598055000"},{"name":"Guolong Chen","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guolong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277944900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270782","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","Scheduling","Particle swarm optimization","Batteries","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","scheduling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","sleep state","sensor nodes","energy balanced sleep scheduling scheme based on particle swarm optimization","EBSS-PSO","cluster based sensor networks","randomized scheduling","RS","energy neighbor based scheduling","ENS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-balanced","sleep scheduling scheme","Particle Swarm Optimization","sensing coverage","overlapping area"]}],"abstract":"In order to conserve battery power in wireless sensor networks, some sensor nodes may be put into the sleep state while other sensor nodes remain active for the sensing and communication tasks. However, determining which of the sensor nodes should be put into the sleep state is non-trivial. In this paper, an Energy-balanced Sleep Scheduling scheme based on Particle Swarm Optimization (EBSS-PSO) in the context of cluster-based sensor networks is proposed. The scheme aims to balance the energy load of the sensing and communication tasks among all the nodes in the cluster while provide adequate sensing coverage area and reduce the overlapping area. Analytical and simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed EBSS-PSO scheme. It is shown that the EBSS-PSO scheme can extends the cluster's overall network lifetime and reduce the overlapping area effectively while maintaining a similar sensing coverage compared with three related sleep scheduling schemes, the Randomized Scheduling (RS) scheme, the Neighbor-based Scheduling (NS) scheme and the Energy-Neighbor-based Scheduling (ENS) scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-balanced Sleep Scheduling Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Wireless Sensor Network","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.154","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270782.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy-balanced Sleep Scheduling Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Wireless Sensor Network","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270782/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947840","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-balanced Sleep Scheduling Based on Particle Swarm Optimization in Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062906S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6270816,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Gong","id":"38244218600"},{"name":"Yuksel Ozan Basciftci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yuksel Ozan","lastName":"Basciftci","id":"38468956000"},{"name":"Fusun Ozguner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Fusun","lastName":"Ozguner","id":"37296297800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270816","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270816","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Estimation","Arrays","Systematics","Message systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","graphics processing units","parallel processing","particle filtering (numerical methods)","shared memory systems","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel resampling algorithm","particle filtering","shared-memory architecture","autonomous vehicle positioning","autonomous vehicle navigation","autonomous vehicle target tracking","time-varying state estimation","noisy measurement","measurement model","computational complexity","parallel implementation","shared-memory systematic resampling algorithm","graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle filters","resampling algorithm","sharedmemory architecture","parallel computing"]}],"abstract":"Many real-world applications such as positioning, navigation, and target tracking for autonomous vehicles require the estimation of some time-varying states based on noisy measurements made on the system. Particle filters can be used when the system model and the measurement model are not Gaussian or linear. However, the computational complexity of particle filters prevents them from being widely adopted. Parallel implementation will make particle filters more feasible for real-time applications. Effective resampling algorithms like the systematic resampling algorithm are serial. In this paper, we propose the shared-memory systematic resampling (SMSR) algorithm that is easily parallelizable on existing architectures.

In addition, many-core processors are more and more frequently characterized by the diversity of their resources and the way the sharing of those resources is arbitrated. On such machines, task scheduling is of paramount importance to orchestrate a satisfactory distribution of tasks with an efficient utilization of resources, especially when fine-grain parallelism is desired or required. In the past, the primary focus of scheduling techniques has been on achieving load balancing and reducing overhead with the aim to increase total performance. This focus has resulted in a scheduling paradigm where Static Scheduling (SS) is preferred to Dynamic Scheduling (DS) for highly regular and embarrassingly parallel applications running on homogeneous architectures. We have revisited the task scheduling problem for these types of applications under the scenario imposed by many-core architectures to investigate whether or not there exists scenarios where DS is better than SS. Our main contribution is the idea that, for highly regular and embarrassingly parallel applications, DS is preferable to SS in some situations commonly found in many-core architectures. We present experimental evidence that shows how the performance of SS is degraded by the new environment on many-core chips. We analyze three reasons that contribute to the superiority of DS over SS on many-core architectures under the situations described: 1) A uniform mapping of work to processors without considering the granularity of tasks is not necessarily scalable under limited amounts of work. 2) The presence of shared resources (i.e. the crossbar switch) produces unexpected and stochastic variations on the duration of tasks that SS is unable to manage properly. 3) Hardware features, such as in-memory atomic operations, greatly contribute to decrease the overhead of DS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270832.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1600","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discussion in Favor of Dynamic Scheduling for Regular Applications in Many-core Architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Computer architecture","Dynamic scheduling","Random access memory","Throughput","Hardware","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic scheduling","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic scheduling","many-core architectures","processor elements","PE","task scheduling","fine-grain parallelism","load balancing","static scheduling","parallel applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["many-core architectures","dynamic scheduling","fine grain","low overhead","load balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Discussion in Favor of Dynamic Scheduling for Regular Applications in Many-core Architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270832/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947884","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discussion in Favor of Dynamic Scheduling for Regular Applications in Many-core Architectures","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081944S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6270850,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Erdem Sariy\u00fcce","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical InformaticsDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering"],"firstName":"Ahmet Erdem","lastName":"Sariy\u00fcce","id":"38234579500"},{"name":"Erik Saule","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Saule","id":"37317903000"},{"name":"\u00dcmit V. \u00c7ataly\u00fcrek","affiliation":["The Ohio State University, USA"],"firstName":"\u00dcmit V.","lastName":"\u00c7ataly\u00fcrek","id":"37275773300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6270850","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Image color analysis","Multicore processing","Resource management","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed memory systems","graph colouring","message passing","parallel processing","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPI","OpenMP","parallel computing","distributed memory","shared memory","hybrid graph coloring algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph algorithm","Graph coloring","Distributed Memory","Shared Memory","Hybrid programming"]}],"abstract":"Graph coloring algorithms are commonly used in large scientific parallel computing either for identifying parallelism or as a tool to reduce computation, such as compressing Hessian matrices.

Thus, it is not surprising that many of top500 supercomputers use accelerators. However, in addition to procurement cost, significant programming and porting effort is required to realize the potential benefit of such accelerators. Hence, before building such a system it is prudent to answer the question 'what is the projected performance benefit from accelerators for the workloads of interest?'. We address this question by way of a performance-modeling framework that predicts realizable application performance on accelerators rapidly and accurately without going to the considerable effort of porting and tuning. The modeling framework first automatically identifies commonly found compute patterns in scientific applications which we term idioms, which may benefit by accelerator technology. Next the framework models the predicted speedup of those idioms if they were to be ported to and run on hardware accelerators. As a proof of concept we characterize two kinds of accelerators 1) the FPGA accelerators on a Convey HC-1 system and 2) an NVIDIA FERMI GPU accelerator. We model performance of the idioms gather/scatter and stream and our predictions show that where these occur in two full-scale HPC applications, Milc and HYCOM, gather/scatter speeds up by as much as 15X, and stream by as much as 14X, whereas the overall compute time of Milc improves by 3.4% and HYCOM by 20%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Predicting Performance of High Performance Computing Applications on Hardware Accelerators","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.226","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270861.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Predicting Performance of High Performance Computing Applications on Hardware Accelerators","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270861/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947910","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Predicting Performance of High Performance Computing Applications on Hardware Accelerators","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676b828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055927S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6270862,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Ji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37902000500"},{"name":"Ashwin M.

However, current programming models can only support the utilization of local GPUs. When using non-local GPUs, programmers need to explicitly call API functions for data communication across computing nodes. As such, programming GPUs in large-scale computing systems is more challenging than local GPUs since local and remote GPUs have to be dealt with separately. In this work, we propose a virtual OpenCL (VOCL) framework to support the transparent virtualization of GPUs. This framework, based on the OpenCL programming model, exposes physical GPUs as decoupled virtual resources that can be transparently managed independent of the application execution. To reduce the virtualization overhead, we optimize the GPU memory accesses and kernel launches. We also extend the VOCL framework to support live task migration across physical GPUs to achieve load balance and/or quick system maintenance. Our experiment results indicate that VOCL can greatly simplify the task of programming cluster-based GPUs at a reasonable virtualization cost.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.325","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269389/6270391/06270892.pdf","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalizing the Utility of GPUs in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6270892/","displayDocTitle":"Generalizing the Utility of GPUs in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Computing Systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6270892/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947940","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalizing the Utility of GPUs in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Computing Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4676c554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055853S","chronDate":"21-25 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269389","isNumber":"6270391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269389","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270391","articleId":"6270892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6270923,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-sen Lai","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronic, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun-sen","lastName":"Lai","id":"37894890500"},{"name":"Ai-ying Yang","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronic, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ai-ying","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288420600"},{"name":"Lin Zuo","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronic, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zuo","id":"38247355500"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronic, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"38468420700"},{"name":"Yu-nan Sun","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronic, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu-nan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291600400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0911-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0910-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8480"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8464"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-8464"}],"articleNumber":"6270923","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Signal to noise ratio","Chromatic dispersion","Optical noise","Modulation","Optical pulses","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","delays","optical distortion","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromatic dispersion monitoring method","duty-cycle return-to-zero on-off key","duty-cycle RZ-OOK signals","carrier-suppressed return-to-zero on-off key signals","half-symbol delay-tap sampling technique","delay-tap sampling scatter plots","CSRZ-OOK signals","signal distortion","CD monitoring","bit rate 40 Gbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6270923","abstract":"A novel chromatic dispersion (CD) monitoring method of 40Gbps 33% duty-cycle return-to-zero on-off key (RZ-OOK), 50% duty-cycle RZ-OOK, and carrier-suppressed return-to-zero on-off key (CSRZ-OOK) signals by using half-symbol delay-tap sampling technique is demonstrated.

Although temperature sensitivity was significantly improved about 12 times higher than naked FBG temperature sensor, its linearity was inferior than naked FBG sensor. In order to not destroy the linearity of the temperature sensor, we let the FBG in a free state in the capillary tube, only fix the two endpoint. The temperature sensitivity is 23.4pm/\u00b0C, and the linearity is good.","doi":"10.1109/SOPO.2012.6271111","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6270008/6270417/06271111.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOPO.2012.6271111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Optical Fiber Bragg Grating Temperature Sensors for Human Body Temperature Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Fiber gratings","Fitting","Optical fibers","Optical fiber sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","biothermics","Bragg gratings","fibre optic sensors","patient monitoring","resins","temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical FBG temperature sensors","fiber Bragg grating","human body temperature monitoring","FBG encapsulation methods","FBG temperature sensor sensitivity","epoxy resin","Teflon pipe","temperature sensitivity","temperature sensor linearity","capillary tube"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study on Optical Fiber Bragg Grating Temperature Sensors for Human Body Temperature Monitoring","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12948294","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271111/","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271111/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Optical Fiber Bragg Grating Temperature Sensors for Human Body Temperature Monitoring","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"pid1119164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03602S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6270008","isNumber":"6270417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6270008","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6270417","articleId":"6271111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271152,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya T.

For better solution, at every step each particle changes its velocity based on its current velocity with respect to its previous best position and position of the current best particle in the population. PSO has found as an efficient method for solving function optimization problems, and recently it also studied to solve combinatorial problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Existing method introduced the idea of Swap Operator (SO) and Swap Sequence (SS) in PSO to handle TSP. For TSP, each particle represents a complete tour and velocity is measured as a SS consisting with several SOs. A SO indicates two positions in the tour that might be swap. In the existing method, a new tour is considered after applying a complete SS with all its SOs. Whereas, every SO implantation on a particle (i.e., a solution or a tour) gives a new solution and there might be a chance to get a better tour with some of SOs instead of all the SOs. The objective of the study is to achieve better result introducing using such partial search option for solving TSP. The proposed PSO with Partial Search (PSOPS) algorithm is shown to produce optimal solution within a less number of generation than standard PSO, Genetic Algorithm in solving benchmark TSP.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271164","startPage":"118","endPage":"121","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271164.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with partial search to solve Traveling Salesman Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Traveling salesman problems","Educational institutions","Benchmark testing","Optimization","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","partial search","traveling salesman problem","PSO","social behavior","function optimization problems","combinatorial problems","TSP","swap operator","SO","swap sequence","SS","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Swap Sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization with partial search to solve Traveling Salesman Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271164/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945548","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization with partial search to solve Traveling Salesman Problem","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1058C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065542S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6271170,"authors":[{"name":"M.

High-precision crystal oscillators can solve the timing problem, but they are often too expensive for consumer grade devices. Since fBS and macrocell Base Station (mBS) network operate on the same frequency under a licensed spectrum fBS network can interfere with the macrocell network. In addition, fBSs can also interfere with each other if multiple units are in close proximity. In some cases, conflicting base stations may simultaneously raise transmit power in order to improve signal quality, thereby creating some interference. Furthermore, in a flat fBS structured network using IEEE 1588 synchronization algorithm and fBS-fBS synchronization scheme creates offset and frequency error which results inaccurate synchronization. However, in this paper an inter-cluster synchronization scheme is proposed in order to reduce offset and frequency error (skew) to achieve precise synchronization in fBS neighbor nodes. The analytical result shows that the proposed scheme is able to reduce the offset and skew significantly through inter-cluster synchronization ultimately increases synchronization accuracy. Therefore, achieved synchronization accuracy is 90% higher than the existing MS-assisted schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271170.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-cluster synchronization scheme for femtocell network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Accuracy","Standards","Frequency synchronization","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crystal oscillators","femtocellular radio","Global Positioning System","IEEE standards","indoor radio","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercluster synchronization scheme","femtocell network","indoor coverage","GPS antenna","time synchronization","high-precision crystal oscillators","consumer grade devices","macrocell base station network","mBS network","licensed spectrum fBS network","signal quality","interference","flat fBS network","IEEE 1588 synchronization algorithm","fBS-fBS synchronization scheme","frequency error","offset reduction","fBS neighbor nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cluster","Synchronization","cluster","inter-cluster","femtocell"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Inter-cluster synchronization scheme for femtocell network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271170/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945552","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-cluster synchronization scheme for femtocell network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1069C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058487S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-05"},{"_id":6271172,"authors":[{"name":"Sufyan Salim Mahmood AlDabbagh","affiliation":["Department of information system, IIUM University, Kuala lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sufyan Salim","lastName":"Mahmood AlDabbagh","id":"38468969700"},{"name":"Ahmed Hassan Mabrouk","affiliation":["Department of computer science, IIUM University, Kuala lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Hassan","lastName":"Mabrouk","id":"37966377800"},{"name":"Imad Fakhri Taha Al Shaikhli","affiliation":["Department of computer science, IIUM University, Kuala lumpur, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Imad Fakhri Taha Al Shaikhli","id":"38243643000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0479-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0478-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0477-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6271172","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"abstract":"Full search block matching algorithm (FSBMA) for motion estimation requires a high level of computations, rendering the technique unsuitable for real-time imaging applications.

This paper presents an improved full search block matching algorithm (IFSBMA) that reduces the computational load without significant degradation of the image quality. In comparison with other full search algorithms, the proposed technique reduces computational intensity with almost 90% for video bowing and 95% for video test. Experimental results also show that the computational complexity of the proposed technique is relatively higher than that of the four-step (FSS) and the three-step (TSS) algorithms. However, the sum of absolute difference (SAD) of the proposed technique is better than the SAD of the FSS and the TSS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271172.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved full search block matching algorithm for imaging applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Motion estimation","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Accuracy","Central Processing Unit","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image matching","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full search block matching algorithm","motion estimation","IFSBMA","real-time imaging applications","computational complexity","image quality","computational intensity","video test","three-step algorithms","four-step algorithms","SAD","FSS","TSS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full Search Algorithm","Block Matching Algorithm and Motion Estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"An improved full search block matching algorithm for imaging applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271172/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945554","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved full search block matching algorithm for imaging applications","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1074C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060398S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271173,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The setup contains two primary users and two cognitive radios or secondary users. One primary user is fixed and the other is allowed to change its position randomly. Depending upon the position of the primary user the cognitive user will use the spectrum band where the detected energy is below certain predefined threshold level. The cognitive radio users are also programmed to operate independently without interfering with each other using energy detection algorithm for spectrum sensing. The modulation scheme is set to GMSK for secondary user performing data transmission. This experimental setup is used to analyze the quality of video transmission using DSA which provides the insight regarding the possibility of using free spectrum space to improve the performance of the system and its advantage over a non-DSA system. From the experiment it is shown that under congestion and interference DSA perform better than a non- DSA system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271185/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12945567","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271185/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experimental implementation of dynamic spectrum access for video transmission using USRP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental implementation of dynamic spectrum access for video transmission using USRP","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1104C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037133S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6271197,"authors":[{"name":"Azila Zakaria","affiliation":["Wireless Network & Protocol Research (WNPR), Wireless Communication Cluster, Kuala Lumpur"],"firstName":"Azila","lastName":"Zakaria","id":"38580652700"},{"name":"Mohammad Tahir","affiliation":["Wireless Network & Protocol Research (WNPR), Wireless Communication Cluster, MIMOS Bhd, Technology Park Malaysia, 57000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tahir"},{"name":"Nordin Ramli","affiliation":["Wireless Network & Protocol Research (WNPR), Wireless Communication Cluster, Kuala Lumpur"],"firstName":"Nordin","lastName":"Ramli","id":"37699538900"},{"name":"Hafizal Mohamad","affiliation":["Wireless Network & Protocol Research (WNPR), Wireless Communication Cluster, Kuala Lumpur"],"firstName":"Hafizal","lastName":"Mohamad","id":"37532339700"},{"name":"Mahamod Ismail","affiliation":["Wireless Network & Protocol Research (WNPR), Wireless Communication Cluster, Kuala Lumpur"],"firstName":"Mahamod","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38183398300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0479-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0478-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0477-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6271197","dbTime":"199 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels","Cognitive radio","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralized cooperative spectrum sensing","decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","CR user","spectrum opportunity detection reliability","spectrum holes","shadowing terminal problem","hidden terminal problem","distributed system","OR rule","AND rule","energy detection","detection probability","signal-to-noise ratio probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cooperative spectrum sensing","centralized","distributed","decentralized","energy detector"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is one of the critical aspects in cognitive radio (CR).

In spectrum sensing, a local radio might fail to monitor the available spectrum holes due to shadowing and hidden terminal problem. Cooperative spectrum sensing can be employed to combat this problem using two approaches; centralized and decentralized (distributed) system. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of both centralized and decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing under several policies; OR and AND rules based on energy detection. The effectiveness of the both centralized and decentralized techniques were investigated and compared in terms of probability of detection and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We observe that the OR rule achieve better performance than AND rule in attaining higher detection probability.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271197","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271197.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271197","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of centralized and decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of centralized and decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271197/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271197/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945576","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of centralized and decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1124C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078323S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6271201,"authors":[{"name":"Liban A.

Due to growing need for bandwidth conservation in wireless communication, the research in speech coding has increased. Compressive Sensing (CS) is gaining a great interest because of its ability to recover original signals by taking only few measurements. CS is a new approach that is different from the common data acquisition methods. In this research, a new approach of speech encoding system is developed using compressive sensing. Since CS performs well in sparse signals, different sparsifying transforms is analyzed and compared using Gini coefficient. The quality of the speech coder is evaluated using Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and subjective listening tests. Results show that the speech coders have achieved a PESQ score of 3.16 at 4 kbps which is a good quality as listening tests confirms. The coder is also compared with Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) coder.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271201","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based low bit rate speech encoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based low bit rate speech encoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271201/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945578","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based low bit rate speech encoder","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1128C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078196S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271209,"authors":[{"name":"Lahouari Ghouti","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Lahouari","lastName":"Ghouti","id":"37295446300"},{"name":"Mohamed A.

The SCFT transform enables efficient use of the embedding properties of the complex Fourier representation without incurring additional computational complexity. The watermark detection is based on a statistical maximum likelihood approach using a Weibull distribution found to be well-suited for modeling the SCFT coefficients. The embedding scheme is image-adaptive, and provides control over the watermark embedding strength according to the local properties of the SCFT host image representation. The efficiency and data hiding capacity of the proposed watermark scheme are shown to be greatly enhanced by the use of semi-random LDPC codes. Simulation results and comparisons with color-component Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based schemes demonstrate the increased robustness of the proposed LDPC-coded, SCFT-based image watermarking algorithm against standard attacks (including additive white Gaussian noise and JPEG compression), and show a reduction in bit error rate (BER) by an order of magnitude.","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271209.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust color image watermarking using the Spatio-Chromatic Fourier Transform and semi-random LDPC codes","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust color image watermarking using the Spatio-Chromatic Fourier Transform and semi-random LDPC codes","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945586","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271209/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust color image watermarking using the Spatio-Chromatic Fourier Transform and semi-random LDPC codes","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1138C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058731S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271222,"authors":[{"name":"Endra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Endra","id":"38468469400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0479-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0478-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0477-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6271222","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":580},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Compressed sensing","Joints","Image reconstruction","Optimization","Sparse matrices","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image coding","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimization","measurement matrix","sparse dictionary","compressive sensing","signal acquisition method","random matrix","average mutual coherence","KSVD","equiangular tight frame method","image encoding","compressive measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","sparse dictionary","measurement matrix","mutual coherence","joint optimization"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing, a novel signal acquisition method, is a joint sensing and compression which requires small number of measurement to reconstruct signal as compared to the conventional method, Shannon-Nyquist sampling theory, which requires at least twice the signal bandwidth. Compressive sensing exploits the sparse representations of signals. A signal is considered sparse if it can be represented by few non-zero coefficients using a suitable basis or dictionary. In order to achieve good reconstruction performance from a few number of measurement, compressive sensing requires a small mutual coherence between a measurement matrix and the basis or dictionary. The commonly used measurement matrix is random matrix because it has a small mutual coherence with many basis like Fourier and Wavelet. Note that, random matrix can further be optimized to achieve even smaller mutual coherence. This paper addresses the joint optimization between measurement matrix and sparse dictionary to minimize the average mutual coherence between them.

Conventionally, timing error is estimated by predefined preamble on both transmitter and receiver. The maximum of the correlation result is considered the start of the OFDM symbol. Problem arises when the prime path is not the strongest one. In this paper, we proposed a new timing error estimation method for multi-band OFDM ultra wide-band (MB-OFDM UWB) systems. it is assumed that a coarse timing has been obtained prior to the proposed method. Based on the coarse timing, search interval is set (or time candidates). Exploiting channel statistics that are assumed to be known at the receiver, we derive a maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP) of the channel impulse response. based on this estimate, we discern for the timing error. Finally, efficient hardware design is proposed for the proposed algorithm for real-time applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271225","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","startPage":"436","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time synchronization fo MB-OFDM UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time synchronization fo MB-OFDM UWB systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271225/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945597","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271225/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time synchronization fo MB-OFDM UWB systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1196C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067762S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271228,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The VHDL model development is based on fixed-point arithmetic. A fixed-point number represents a number which has fixed number of digits after and before of the radix point and of real data type. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a method that uses wavelet analyser in which case the signals composed into small pieces preserving both time and frequency properties. Out of the mother wavelet functions family, 2nd order of Daubechies (4-tap) has been widely used in denoising various types of biomedical signals. This research work involves with the VHDL modeling of Daubechies wavelet which is developed by Ingrid Daubechies. The functionality of VHDL model for DWT structure has been tested successfully and its performance level is in the satisfactory region (up to two decimal points of precision).","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering

maximization is one of the main challenges in cognitive radio ad hoc networks, where the availability of local spectrum resources may change from time to time and hop by hop. Technologies based on 802.16e which called Mobile WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability Microwave Access) promises to deliver high data rates over large distances and deliver multimedia services and are expected to play a major role in high speed broadband delivery. The maximum allowed number of hops must be carefully considered because higher number of hops will increase the transmission time and degrades the throughput and end to end delay. Multi-hop based network may also improve the system performance by using cooperative relay technique. There are various challenges for the routing in WiMAX mesh such as delay, long transmission scheduling, and increasingly stringent Quality of Service (QoS) support and load balance and fairness limitations. In this paper we use cognitive radio network composed of wireless devices able to opportunistically access the shred radio resource. The core of such networking paradigm is the capability of cognitive radio to monitor spectrum occupation to exploit spectrums holes for transition. Extensive simulations are conducted under MATLAB and compare the performance of our routing protocol with AODV for Mobile WiMAX environment. The propose algorithm shows high throughput, reduce end to end delay, and increase packet delivery ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12945603","htmlLink":"/document/6271231/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"On QoS routing in Mobile WiMAX cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On QoS routing in Mobile WiMAX cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1218C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085441S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271232,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed F.

The numerical results confirm that the proposed system using modified-AND subtraction detection can substantially accommodate a lot of users with enhanced PDF and higher SNR.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271243","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","startPage":"531","endPage":"534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved probability density function using modified-AND detection technique for incoherent SAC-OCDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved probability density function using modified-AND detection technique for incoherent SAC-OCDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271243/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945613","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271243/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved probability density function using modified-AND detection technique for incoherent SAC-OCDMA systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1267C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078678S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6271271,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Kamrul Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kualalumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Kamrul","lastName":"Hasan","id":"38237128900"},{"name":"Aisha H.

Data loading and offloading to the macro Base Station (mBS) is supported through internet backhaul which exhibits the uniqueness of this technology. Interference is one of the most challenging phenomenon's that arise due to the non-synchronized femtocell. It is known that fBS and macrocells Base Station (mBS) network operates on the same frequency under a licensed spectrum hence; fBS network can interfere with the macrocells network. However, in this paper, cluster-based synchronization scheme has been proposed which functions through clustering, inter-cluster synchronization scheme. The proposed scheme mainly focuses on reducing the clock offset and skew as well as message overhead. Cluster-based synchronization scheme provides high scalability and works in a decentralized manner which can support a large number of fBS networks with a satisfactory performance level in term of synchronization accuracy. In this paper, it has shown that proposed scheme's synchronization accuracy is higher than any of the existing schemes so far.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271271","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263317/6271140/06271271.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2012.6271271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-based synchronization scheme for femtocell network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271271/","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-based synchronization scheme for femtocell network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945641","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271271/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-based synchronization scheme for femtocell network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1332C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056336S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263317","isNumber":"6271140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263317","xplore-issue":"6271140","articleId":"6271271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6271278,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Wei Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Wei Chang","id":"38469097700"},{"name":"Yu-Hsiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Hsiang Lin","id":"37655873000"},{"name":"Rong-Hong Jan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rong-Hong Jan","id":"37273447400"},{"name":"Chien Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien Chen","id":"37293083500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0937-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0935-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0936-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6271278","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time measurement","Wireless networks","Monitoring","Femtocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient measurement procedure","handover","LTE femtocell networks","Long Term Evolution femtocell networks","user equipment","UE","home eNB","HeNB","measurement configuration","signal strength","above-mentioned problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","femtocell","handover"]}],"abstract":"In LTE (Long Term Evolution) femtocell networks, user equipment (UE) has to measure all the eNBs and Home eNBs (HeNBs) in the Measurement Configuration and find a suitable eNB (or HeNB) to hand over to. However, there are many HeNBs under the coverage of one eNB. In other words, the UE has to measure all the eNBs and HeNBs, no matter whether they are in or out of range. In addition, in many urban areas, the indoor signal strength of LTE networks is fairly good due to the dense deployment of eNBs. As a consequence, the source eNB will not ask the UE entering the coverage of an HeNB to perform the measurement procedure because the source eNB can still provide a desirable signal strength. In this case, the UE will still camp on the eNB, and the HeNB is therefore idle. In this paper, we propose an efficient measurement procedure for handover in LTE femtocell networks to solve the two above-mentioned problems. The simulation results show that the measurement overhead and the average idle time are significantly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/iCOST.2012.6271278","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile and Wireless Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile and Wireless Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263357/6271272/06271278.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCOST.2012.6271278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271272","startPage":"119","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient measurement procedure for handover in LTE femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient measurement procedure for handover in LTE femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271278/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945706","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271278/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient measurement procedure for handover in LTE femtocell networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p119chang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045172S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263357","isNumber":"6271272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263357","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6271272","articleId":"6271278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271283,"authors":[{"name":"Nurilla Avazov","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Nurilla","lastName":"Avazov","id":"37992175400"},{"name":"Matthias P\u00e4tzold","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"P\u00e4tzold","id":"37268363500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0937-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0935-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0936-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6271283","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Scattering","Receivers","Transmitters","MIMO","Channel models","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","MIMO communication","mobile radio","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband MIMO car-to-car channel model","geometrical street scattering model","multiple-input multiple-output car-to-car channel model","reference channel model","single-bounce scattering","line-of-sight propagation environments","non-LOS propagation environments","NLOS","rectangular grids","3D CCF","three-dimensional space-time cross-correlation function","temporal autocorrelation function","two-dimensional space CCF","2D space CCF","sum-of-cisoids channel simulator","temporal ACF","SOC channel simulator","nearby street scatterers","C2C communication systems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we model a narrowband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) car-to-car (C2C) channel model based on the geometrical street scattering model.

In the proposed channel model, an infinite number of scatterers are uniformly distributed in rectangular grids located on both sides of the street. Analytical solutions are presented for the three-dimensional (3D) space-time cross-correlation function (CCF), the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), and the two-dimensional (2D) space CCF. An efficient sum-of-cisoids (SOC) channel simulator will be derived from the reference model. It is shown that the temporal ACF of the SOC channel simulator fits very well to that of the reference model.

wireless sensor networks are gaining a lot of attention due to the availability of various low cost sensor devices. For example, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have lot of new potential applications in different domains including, environmental monitoring, home automation, tracking, health care, just to name a few. Another example is the Body Area Networks (BANs), where different sensors are attached with the patient's body. However, these sensor networks also bring several challenges, such as they are resource constraint, requires application specific QoS requirements, high bandwidth demands, and resistance to interference. In this paper, we argue that wireless sensor nodes with cognitive radio capability, together with channel bonding, can help to address these challenges. In this perspective, we discuss cognitive radio wireless sensor network for hospital environment as a case study. We then discuss the way of spectrum characterization and criteria for channel bonding in such networks. Finally, we highlight issues and challenges, which provides the basis to develop algorithms and protocols for the future cognitive radio wireless sensor network deployments in different application scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12945721","htmlLink":"/document/6271293/","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Channel bonding in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel bonding in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p72rehmani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075415S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263357","isNumber":"6271272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263357","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6271272","articleId":"6271293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271295,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A common requirement present in fourth generation systems is the inclusion of self-organizing technologies that facilitate deployment, operation and management of femtocells. As femtocells are designed to be installed by the user in unplanned locations it is critical to mitigate the interference created for macrocells as well as that between femtocells. In this article we propose employing distributed cooperative control theory to enable self organization of femtocell transmitters to mitigate interference via power control. We study how different types of controllers can be constructed, evaluate their performance and compare them against a closed solution based on Perron's theorem. A clear advantage of the proposed approach is that it has been proven to converge under simple, realistic assumptions. We show how our solution mitigates both outdoor and indoor interference in different environments including those where femto transmitters are located far away from a cluster.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile and Wireless Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/6263357/6271272/06271295.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile and Wireless Networking","doi":"10.1109/iCOST.2012.6271295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iCOST.2012.6271295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organized distributed cooperative control of interference in femtocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Gain","Base stations","Bandwidth","Propagation losses","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cooperative communication","distributed control","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","power control","radio transmitters","telecommunication network management","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organized distributed cooperative control","femtocell network management","wide area wireless network","bandwidth intensive application","fourth generation system","macrocell network","femtocell transmitter","interference mitigation","power control","Perron theorem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Self-organized distributed cooperative control of interference in femtocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271295/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12945723","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organized distributed cooperative control of interference in femtocell networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p7arauz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159015S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6263357","isNumber":"6271272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6263357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6271272","articleId":"6271295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271296,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuki Taniguchi","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Informatics advanced Wireless Communication research center (AWCC), University of Eletro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuki","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37273806800"},{"name":"Yoshio Karasawa","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Informatics advanced Wireless Communication research center (AWCC), University of Eletro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Karasawa","id":"37270162200"},{"name":"Nobuo Nakajima","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Informatics advanced Wireless Communication research center (AWCC), University of Eletro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuo","lastName":"Nakajima","id":"37413032000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0937-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0935-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0936-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6271296","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"This paper examines the effect of coordinated base station (BS) assuming the uplink case in multi-cellular system for the application of performance recovery in the disaster cells where their BS is broken and not working.

First, we analyze the rate-utility relationship of scalable video by a packet prioritization scheme, which ensures an optimized video utility under the rate constraint. The scalable framework is then proposed to achieve differentiated service objectives for different video layers. To provide every user with a fair opportunity to receive video for basic viewing, a MAXMIN fairness is designed to have their base layer video packets received. When all users have their base layer packets successfully received, the resources are distributed to exploit network efficiency. Resource allocations are accomplished by the efficient bit loading and power allocation for different optimization goals. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated by comparing with conventional resource allocation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271421","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271421.pdf","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable resource allocation framework for SVC video transmissions over downlink MIMO-OFDM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271421/","displayDocTitle":"A scalable resource allocation framework for SVC video transmissions over downlink MIMO-OFDM networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271421/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable resource allocation framework for SVC video transmissions over downlink MIMO-OFDM networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043395S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271425,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Nan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Nan","id":"38231461000"},{"name":"Yifeng He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yifeng","lastName":"He","id":"37532426000"},{"name":"Ling Guan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272209000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271425","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"abstract":"Multimedia cloud is an emerging computing paradigm that can effectively process multimedia applications and provide multi-QoS provisions for customers.

It is demonstrated that the gain and phase mismatches in the LINC amplifier introduce severe nonlinear distortions to its output signal, which severely degrades the overall system performance, and that the proposed calibration approach accurately determines the gain and phase mismatches, effectively compensates for their effects, and significantly improves the LINC amplifier performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271462/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Statistics-based LINC amplifier calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistics-based LINC amplifier calibration","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1247crown.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047004S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6271464,"authors":[{"name":"Chiao-En Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical/Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiao-En","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406732000"},{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical/Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Su","id":"38468838900"},{"name":"Chun-Fu Liao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Fu","lastName":"Liao","id":"37399421100"},{"name":"Yuang-Hao Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuang-Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37066576800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271464","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Lattices","Detectors","Bit error rate","Vectors","Complexity theory"]}],"abstract":"Lattice reduction (LR) has emerged as a popular technique to improve the performance of many low complexity MIMO detectors. Among the existing LR algorithms, the LLL algorithm has been applied to MIMO communications almost exclusively to date. However, the conventional LLL algorithm has variable reduction time, and hence non-constant throughput for the resulting communications system. In order to address this issue, this paper proposed a new variant of the LLL-algorithm (CT-LLL-deep) having constant throughput by introducing the concept of deep insertion into a parallel variant of LLL. Simulation results show that LR-aided detectors using the proposed CT-LLL-deep are capable of achieving lower bit error rate with much less reduction time, comparing to those using other existing LR algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271464","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271464.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constant-throughput LLL algorithm with deep insertion for LR-aided MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271464/","displayDocTitle":"A constant-throughput LLL algorithm with deep insertion for LR-aided MIMO detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271464/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constant-throughput LLL algorithm with deep insertion for LR-aided MIMO detection","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056805S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271465,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwen Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wenwen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599764600"},{"name":"Saman S.

The proposed framework comprises of two parts working in a joint manner: a symbol by symbol MAP CPM receiver and a channel tracking scheme. We first illustrate the robustness of MSK over modulation schemes without memory such as BPSK in joint data and channel estimation scheme. In order to adopt coherent demodulation, channel tracking is commonly used in time-varying channels. The underlying channel model in conjunction with data based estimate enables the Kalman filter to produce LMMSE estimates of the channel coefficients. Most literature do not consider the channel estimation error covariance in data detection. Here, A MAP data detection combined with Kalman tracking of channel coefficients is proposed in which we consider the channel error covariance for every step of MAP data detection. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme offers good performance in moderate or even high fading rate environments.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1258","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271465.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for CPM in frequency-flat fading channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Joints","Binary phase shift keying","Receivers","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CPM","Data detection","Channel tracking","Fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for CPM in frequency-flat fading channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271465/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271465/","publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data detection and channel estimation for CPM in frequency-flat fading channel","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055184S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6271466,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Faculty EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37683769600"},{"name":"Zijian Tang","affiliation":["TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37289979400"},{"name":"Hao Lu","affiliation":["Faculty EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37593314400"},{"name":"Rene van Leuken","affiliation":["Faculty EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"van Leuken","id":"37393976600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271466","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Mobile communication","Niobium","Estimation","Accuracy","Hafnium"]}],"abstract":"Mobile OFDM refers to OFDM systems with fast moving transceivers, contrastive to traditional OFDM systems whose transceivers are stationary or have a low velocity.

The algorithm utilizes a simple hypothesis testing to decide presence of PBNI in any particular hop after dehopping. A suitable threshold level is first derived to detect the PBNI by analyzing the statistical property of the outputs of two correlators used for quadrature phase-shift-keying (QPSK) demodulation. Then, the proposed detector is developed by summing the outputs of the correlators over one hop duration.

Our platform allows to select the most suitable accelerator according to the requirements of an application. Moreover, we optimize the number of ALUs, memory and interconnection network of the selected accelerators to increase the performance and to reduce the power consumption. Experimental results with simple media processing applications times power-efficient compared to the GPU.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271489","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271489.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of heterogeneous multicore platform with SIMD/MIMD custom accelerators","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271489/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of heterogeneous multicore platform with SIMD/MIMD custom accelerators","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072702S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271497,"authors":[{"name":"Yongsheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405823000"},{"name":"Hongkai Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongkai","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37279752500"},{"name":"Chang Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Chang Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271497","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Slepian-Wolf decoding algorithm exploiting geometric regularity constraints with anisotropic MRF modeling","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel Slepian-Wolf decoding algorithm for distributed video coding by exploiting not only the statistical correlation between the side-information and source but also the spatio-temporal consistency constraint of video sequences.

The transposition-free structure and pipeline structure produce one column of output during each clock cycle, while the folded structure requires two clock cycles for that. The folded structure uses one 1-D DHT module for both row and column processing, while the pipeline structure processes rows and columns concurrently using two separate 1-D DHT modules. Interestingly, the transposition-unit of the pipeline structure involves nearly the same number of registers as the folded structure, and offers twice the throughput of the other. The transposition-free structure is less area-time efficient than pipeline structure due to its relatively less efficient serial-output processors. ASIC synthesis result shows that the pipeline structure involves 47.4% less area-delay product (ADP) and 53.74% less energy per sample (EPS) than the folded structure, and involves slightly less ADP and consumes 31.67% less EPS than the transposition-free design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient architectures for VLSI implementation of 2-D discrete Hadamard transform","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271527","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271527.pdf","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient architectures for VLSI implementation of 2-D discrete Hadamard transform","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271527/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient architectures for VLSI implementation of 2-D discrete Hadamard transform","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042528S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271528,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva Madishetty","affiliation":["ECE, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Shiva","lastName":"Madishetty","id":"38468278300"},{"name":"Arjuna Madanayake","affiliation":["ECE, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Arjuna","lastName":"Madanayake","id":"37270779600"},{"name":"Renato J.

By mapping the irrational coefficients to a convenient AI basis, the proposed architecture is designed employing a parallel channel model having two data paths carrying integer sequences. The computations done in the AI architecture are exactly accurate and are done entirely in a multiplier-free circuit. The design is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 device at 172 MHz and hardware co-simulated with an ML605 board at 100 MHz. AI mapping facilitates simplicity and error-free calculations. The proposed architecture has a single final reconstruction step (FRS). Booth encoding has been adopted at the FRS to minimize the error which can be incurred at this point. This paper provides a hardware and power analysis for different bit lengths. An example output image sequence for the mandrill image is also provided.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271528.pdf","startPage":"1484","endPage":"1487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-free VLSI architecture for the 2-D Daubechies 4-tap filter using algebraic integers","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Error-free VLSI architecture for the 2-D Daubechies 4-tap filter using algebraic integers","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271528/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-free VLSI architecture for the 2-D Daubechies 4-tap filter using algebraic integers","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051098S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271533,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Furthermore, the SoC is biased by vibration-based energy scavenger, and a as consequence, very low power is available for the integrated circuits. High input impedance is required from system level constraints and this is achieved with MOS input devices, exploiting dual differential input Opamp. The PGA gain is programmable in the 15dB-to-50dB range with 1dB step. For the maximum gain level (50dB), the Input-Referred-Noise power spectral density is lower than 20nV/vHz.

In this paper, a complex-valued QR factorization (CQRF) scheme realized via a sequence of real-value Givens rotations is first presented. An efficient CQRF design using coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) modules is next developed. The design features a highly parallel architecture to support high throughput operations. One CQRF can be obtained in every 8 clock cycles. To reduce the circuit complexity, a pipelined CORDIC structure is also applied. The implementation results in TSMC 0.18-\u00b5m CMOS process indicate that the proposed design can achieve a throughput rate of 25MCQRFs per second while consuming only 103.7k gates in circuit complexity. Performance evaluation based on a composite index consisting of area and throughput rate also shows the advantages of the proposed design against other similar works.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271535","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient QR decomposition design for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient QR decomposition design for MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271535/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271535/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient QR decomposition design for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042598S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271536,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292503700"},{"name":"Ying-Yi Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Yi","lastName":"Chen","id":"38248135300"},{"name":"Hung-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Chin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292562300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271536","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel preamble design of Gaussian pulses, along with a synchronization scheme, for cooperative MIMO OFDM systems. In our preamble design, the training signals of cooperating nodes are well separated from each other in both time domain and frequency domain to suppress their mutual interference in both domains, whereas they are only separated in either of the two domains in the state of the art. Accordingly, multiple propagation delays and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) can be jointly estimated using the proposed synchronization scheme, while they are separately estimated in time domain and frequency domain in conventional synchronization schemes. We also design a proper correlation window size for the proposed synchronization scheme to effectively reduce computational complexity as well as to maintain satisfactory performance.

Unlike conventional MIMO systems, cooperative transmitters may distribute geographically instead of co-locating at the same spot. Therefore, it is hard for the destination node to compensate multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFOs) even if the cooperative transmitters use the same clock, and the conventional MIMO decoding strategy may not be suitable. In this paper, we consider cooperative SFBC-OFDM transmission with MCFOs. The proposed strategy carefully combines two sets of separately synchronized signal to mitigate inter-carrier interference (ICI). Maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) and iterative interference cancellation is further deployed to improve performance. Simulation results show the diversity gain is maintained and an improved tolerance range of MCFOs is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SFBC-OFDM receiver with MLSE equalizer to combat multiple frequency offsets","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271539","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271539.pdf","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"An SFBC-OFDM receiver with MLSE equalizer to combat multiple frequency offsets","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271539/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SFBC-OFDM receiver with MLSE equalizer to combat multiple frequency offsets","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04856S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271552,"authors":[{"name":"Georges Kaddoum","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Kaddoum","id":"37398102200"},{"name":"Mai Vu","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Vu","id":"37268913400"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Gagnon","affiliation":["\u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37276754800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271552","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaotic communication","Bit error rate","Modulation","MIMO","Receivers","Equations"]}],"abstract":"The feasibility of having chaos-based communication in a MIMO system is presented.

Our analysis shows that the equilibrium point, which is unstable in the classic integer-order model, can become asymptotically stable in our fractional-order model, which is also confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, we also present simulation results of limit cycles produced by the fractional-order neural network model.

The measurement results show that the proposed technique successfully reduces the FPN by 66% while preserving the inherent performance advantages of the PD-storage dual-capture CMOS image sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271565","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271565.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New FPN correction method for PD-storage dual-capture CMOS image sensor using a nonfully depleted pinned photodiode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New FPN correction method for PD-storage dual-capture CMOS image sensor using a nonfully depleted pinned photodiode","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271565/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271565/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New FPN correction method for PD-storage dual-capture CMOS image sensor using a nonfully depleted pinned photodiode","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055517S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271566,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Yu","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Center of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Yu","id":"38237545200"},{"name":"Xinyuan Qian","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Center of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xinyuan","lastName":"Qian","id":"38236457300"},{"name":"Shoushun Chen","affiliation":["VIRTUS IC Design Center of Excellence, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shoushun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535877300"},{"name":"Kay Soon Low","affiliation":["Satellite Research Center, School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kay Soon","lastName":"Low","id":"37378921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271566","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":678},"abstract":"In this paper, we report a novel Time-Delay-Integration (TDI) CMOS image sensor for low-earth orbit (LEO) nano-satellite imaging application, where limited exposure time and unexpected flight fluctuations are major design challenges.

The proposed vision sensor can either work in an asynchronous motion detection mode or synchronous region of interest (ROI) readout mode, with different resolutions. In the first mode, relative intensity changes are monitored by a motion detection unit formed of 2\u00d72 pixels and further diffused by a capacitance coupling network to reduce spatial noise. After tunable thresholding, active motions are converted into binary events and asynchronously delivered to the outside using an address-event-representation (AER) protocol. In the ROI extraction mode, this image sensor sequentially accesses each pixel in the interested region to report an analog intensity image with a higher resolution. This sensor has been implemented using a standard 0.18 \u00b5m CMOS process. Each pixel contains three capacitors and around 10 transistors, occupying a silicon area of 25\u00d725 \u00b5m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, with a fill factor of \u223c42%.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271567","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271567.pdf","startPage":"1628","endPage":"1631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid-readout and dynamic-resolution motion detection image sensor for object tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271567/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid-readout and dynamic-resolution motion detection image sensor for object tracking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271567/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid-readout and dynamic-resolution motion detection image sensor for object tracking","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043412S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271587,"authors":[{"name":"Shen-Jui Huang","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shen-Jui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536725400"},{"name":"Sau-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sau-Gee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277602600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271587","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","WiMAX","Discrete Fourier transforms","Processor scheduling","Quadrature amplitude modulation","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an area-efficient continuous-flow FFT/IFFT processor for Wimax application.

These are essential for high efficiency operation only in the absence of losses. In this work, more general design equations have been derived without imposition of either ZVS or ZDVS. The optimal design is found to exhibit neither ZVS nor ZDVS, thereby validating the analysis. For the first time, an attempt has been made to incorporate the input power into the analysis, which facilitates optimization of power-added efficiency (PAE). The resulting designs exhibit better performance in terms of output power and PAE compared to existing design approaches. The analytical results have been verified through Spectre-RF simulations at 5GHz in 0.18\u00b5m and 65nm CMOS. Through this design procedure, we further demonstrate that Class-E PAs at 5GHz based on thick-oxide devices in 0.18\u00b5m CMOS, despite their lower speed, outperform those based on 65nm CMOS devices due to their higher voltage-handling capability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271605.pdf","startPage":"1763","endPage":"1766","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved analysis and design methodology for RF Class-E power amplifiers with finite DC-feed inductance and switch On-resistance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Switches","CMOS technology","Inductance","Switching circuits","Power generation","Radio frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"An improved analysis and design methodology for RF Class-E power amplifiers with finite DC-feed inductance and switch On-resistance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271605/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved analysis and design methodology for RF Class-E power amplifiers with finite DC-feed inductance and switch On-resistance","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051276S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271606,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lin","id":"38247795900"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274912700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271606","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Parity check codes","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Convergence","Memory management","Degradation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a shuffled schedule of the Min-Max decoding algorithm is proposed for nonbinary LDPC codes.

Therefore, QC-RS-LDPC decoder using the proposed method can use Banyan network or QSN that are efficient switch networks for QC codes. For performance comparison, the switch networks have been implemented. The results show that the switch network using the proposed method requires less memory size than existing switch network like Benes network. Since the switch network optimized for QC codes reduces critical path delay, the clock speed of QC-RS-LDPC decoder can be improved.

Simulation and analysis results have confirmed the efficiency of the proposed design solution, where more than 75% hardware resources are reused between the adopted algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271615","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","startPage":"1799","endPage":"1802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping channel estimation and MIMO detection in LTE-advanced on a reconfigurable cell array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mapping channel estimation and MIMO detection in LTE-advanced on a reconfigurable cell array","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271615/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271615/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping channel estimation and MIMO detection in LTE-advanced on a reconfigurable cell array","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057195S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271619,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yi-Chung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716848000"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New york University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37407153400"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536599900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271619","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":772},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271619","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Latches","Arrays","Resistance","Sensors","Random access memory","Decoding"]}],"abstract":"Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a promising candidate to substitute static random access memory (SRAM) in lookup table (LUT) design for its high density and non-volatility. RRAM cells are fabricated at backend CMOS process and have negligible area cost. However, the complex peripheral circuit design to satisfy performance and accuracy requirements becomes a major issue. In this work, we propose a novel peripheral circuit for RRAM-based LUT. A new decoding scheme that supports dynamic programming is introduced. Furthermore, the expanded RRAM crossbar array together with the latch comparator based sense amplifier can dramatically reduce design complexity, decrease area cost, and improve tolerance on process variations. Compared to a 6-input SRAM-based LUT, the proposed RRAM-based one cuts off 60.4% of layout area. The maximal operating frequency reaches 1GHz at 10mV input difference. Simulations also show that the proposed LUT functions properly even RRAM resistances deviates 20% from the design value.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271619","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271619.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel peripheral circuit for RRAM-based LUT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel peripheral circuit for RRAM-based LUT","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271619/","publicationDate":"May 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel peripheral circuit for RRAM-based LUT","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p1811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050684S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271622,"authors":[{"name":"Janna Mezhibovsky","affiliation":["The Low Power Circuits and Systems Lab (LPC&S), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Janna","lastName":"Mezhibovsky","id":"38230301300"},{"name":"Adam Teman","affiliation":["The Low Power Circuits and Systems Lab (LPC&S), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Teman","id":"37569751900"},{"name":"Alexander Fish","affiliation":["The Low Power Circuits and Systems Lab (LPC&S), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Fish","id":"37268457100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271622","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Stability analysis","Circuit stability","Solid modeling","Mathematical model","Standards","Integrated circuit modeling"]}],"abstract":"Continuous technology scaling has made traditional Static Noise Margin metrics for stability analysis of SRAM bitcells insufficient.

An algorithm for state-space and phase-portrait plotting is proposed and shown to correctly predict subthreshold hold and write behavior of standard bitcells in a 40nm CMOS technology.

First, a 10T SRAM bitcell is proposed. It activates only intended bitcells so that stability problem of half-selected bitcells is completely eliminated and the power dissipation in half-selected columns is significantly reduced. Second, a configurable DVS scheme is employed to enable the bitcell to operate like differential 8T during super-threshold region which results in faster operation. The proposed SRAM can operate up to 1.2GHz at 1.2V using 65nm CMOS process. Third, a segmented column multiplex with low overhead is proposed, which greatly reduces the power dissipation due to the column control signals. Consequently, the write and read power dissipations are reduced by up to 40% and 67% respectively. Forth, a hierarchical read bitline is used to reduce the read bitline discharge delay variation due to local and global process variation in subthreshold region, which is a major portion of memory access time.

Existing design methods for three-stage OTAs lead to sub-optimal solutions because they decouple inter-related metrics like noise and settling performance. In our approach, the problem of finding an optimal design with the best total integrated noise and settling time has been cohesively solved by formulating a nonlinear constrained optimization program. Equality, inequality, and semi-infinite constraints are formed using closed form symbolic expressions obtained by a closed loop analysis of the SC gain stage and the optimization program is solved by using the interior-point algorithm. Simulation results show that the amplifier achieves a \u00b1 0.1% dynamic error settling time of 2.5 ns with a total integrated noise of 240 \u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n, while consuming 5.2 mW from a 1-V power supply.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271684","startPage":"205","endPage":"208","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271684.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Settling time and noise optimization of a three-stage operational transconductance amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Settling time and noise optimization of a three-stage operational transconductance amplifier","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271684/","accessionNumber":"12946437","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271684/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Settling time and noise optimization of a three-stage operational transconductance amplifier","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054372S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6271693,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China","School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274114100"},{"name":"Wei Xing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei Xing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37288601200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271693","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271693","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Vectors","Stability analysis","Cellular neural networks","Delay","Associative memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","concave programming","convex programming","delays","recurrent neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential stability","multiple equilibria","delayed recurrent neural networks","time-varying delays","concave convex characteristics","equilibrium points"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271693","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271693.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of exponential stability of multiple equilibria in delayed recurrent neural networks","abstract":"The problem of exponential stability of multiple equilibria in recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays and concave-convex characteristics is addressed in this paper.

For a 3V output swing at 5V supply, the resolution is about 15bit.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271717","startPage":"2167","endPage":"2170","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271717.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A current-to-voltage integrator using area-efficient correlated double sampling technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A current-to-voltage integrator using area-efficient correlated double sampling technique","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271717/","accessionNumber":"12946468","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271717/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A current-to-voltage integrator using area-efficient correlated double sampling technique","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042547S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6271720,"authors":[{"name":"Naoto Ogawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of EECE, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"38468850600"},{"name":"Kohei Ohtani","affiliation":["Undergraduate School of EECE, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Ohtani","id":"38468303000"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Sugimoto","affiliation":["Department of EECE, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Sugimoto","id":"37067614200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271720","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"abstract":"A 1.8-V operational 3-stage Amplifier with a 99 dB of voltage gain, a 650 MHz of the unity-gain frequency bandwidth and 54 degrees of phase margin is realized. It has two pairs of a resistor and a capacitor in series as feedback elements and a feed-forward transconductance amplifier to perform threefold phase compensation. In order to apply this threefold phase compensation scheme to realize a high gain and high frequency 3-stage amplifier with enough phase margin, the small signal equivalent circuit model with stray capacitors at the output of each stage of amplifier is newly developed and the small signal transfer function including those stray capacitors are formulated. The transfer function is factorized into poles and zeros so that their relationship and influence on the frequency characteristics can be examined. The 3-stage amplifier is actually circuit designed by using 0.18\u03bcm CMOS devices. The calculated gain and phase frequency characteristics from our equivalent circuit model with stray capacitors have agreed very well with SPICE simulation results of the actual circuit especially at high frequencies above 1 GHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Gain","Equivalent circuits","Poles and zeros","Integrated circuit modeling","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","circuit simulation","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","equivalent circuits","feedback amplifiers","feedforward amplifiers","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","operational amplifiers","poles and zeros","resistors","transfer functions","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage stable phase compensation technique","three-stage amplifier","unity-gain frequency bandwidth","phase margin","resistor","feedback element","feed-forward transconductance amplifier","threefold phase compensation scheme","small signal equivalent circuit model","stray capacitor","small signal transfer function","pole and zero","CMOS device","circuit design","SPICE simulation","phase frequency characteristics","gain 99 dB","bandwidth 650 MHz","voltage 1.8 V","size 0.18 mum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271720","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271720.pdf","startPage":"2175","endPage":"2178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-voltage and stable phase compensation technique to realize an 99 dB, 650 MHz and 1.8 V three-stage Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-voltage and stable phase compensation technique to realize an 99 dB, 650 MHz and 1.8 V three-stage Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271720/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271720/","accessionNumber":"12946471","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-voltage and stable phase compensation technique to realize an 99 dB, 650 MHz and 1.8 V three-stage Amplifier","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043994S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6271723,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The simulation results show that the shunt-feedback TIA achieves a maximal gain of 112 dB\u03a9 over a 2 MHz bandwidth, whereas the current-mode TIA has a flat gain of roughly 83 dB\u03a9 over a 115 MHz bandwidth. The overall input rms noise of each circuit was 185pA/\u221aHz and 53nA/\u221aHz, respectively, with power consumptions of 0.5 mW and 28.6 mW.

Although the tunneling current varies depending on the translational and rotational movement of the DNA, the developed scheme cumulates charge at the parasitic capacitance of the nanopore device so that the base-types can be distinguished even under such noisy condition. A circuit simulation demonstrates that the scheme successfully distinguishes between each DNA base at the speed of 2.0 ms/base. The speed is roughly six orders faster than that of a conventional DNA sequencer. With another scheme which reads complementary base-pair simultaneously with two nanopores, the speed is further improved, and the human genome can be sequenced in only one day if 100 nanopore systems operate in parallel with the scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fluctuation tolerant read scheme for ultrafast DNA sequencing with nanopore device","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271754","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271754.pdf","startPage":"2299","endPage":"2302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fluctuation tolerant read scheme for ultrafast DNA sequencing with nanopore device","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271754/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946505","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fluctuation tolerant read scheme for ultrafast DNA sequencing with nanopore device","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074766S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6271758,"authors":[{"name":"Eman El Mandouh","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Egypt"],"firstName":"Eman","lastName":"El Mandouh","id":"38468625000"},{"name":"Amr G.

We propose a framework that combines searching for known assertion via templates with frequent and sequential patterns mining, while constraining the search by some knowledge about the design. These constraints can be automatically extracted using static analysis methods from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) description of the design, or as a user input to the assertion detector.

The finer directional wavelet transform has been proposed to improve the directionality of the 2D separable wavelet transform. The finer directional wavelet transform employs quadrant filters on subband outputs of the 2D separable wavelet transform. It divides the three directional subband of wavelet transform into six finer directional subbands. Even though the finer directional wavelet transform has advantages of being non redundant and has efficient separable implementation, it suffers in performance due to aliasing. The aliasing occurs due to the quadrant filters' inherent frequency response characteristics and thus cannot be eliminated. This paper addresses the aliasing involved in the implementation of the finer directional wavelet transform and recommends ways to reduce the aliasing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271766.pdf","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2348","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the aliasing effect of the finer directional wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium","Complexity theory","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finer directional wavelet transform","aliasing effect","2D separable wavelet transform","directional subbands","quadrant filters","non redundant","frequency response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the aliasing effect of the finer directional wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946517","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the aliasing effect of the finer directional wavelet transform","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042756S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6271767,"authors":[{"name":"Weibo Hu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Weibo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37710522600"},{"name":"Donald Y.C.

In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) assisted analog adaptive array is proposed for 60 GHz indoor applications to mitigate the CCI. The GA optimizes the weights on each receiver path to attenuate CCI from different directions and improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with robustness. We make two further improvements for better spatial re-use. First, we take into account the trade-off between array gain at the desired direction and interference suppression by proposing adaptivity on the weights control in GA. By adaptively increasing phase perturbation, near-optimum SINR can be achieved for different interference situations. Secondly, in some cases, the link requires less receiver paths than available, e.g. for line-of-sight links. So instead of using fixed antennas, we further propose antenna selection in the GA. A further improvement on spatial re-use can be achieved compared to arrays with fixed uniform spacing.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271774","startPage":"2373","endPage":"2376","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271774.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mm-wave analog adaptive array with genetic algorithm for interference mitigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271774/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A mm-wave analog adaptive array with genetic algorithm for interference mitigation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271774/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12946525","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mm-wave analog adaptive array with genetic algorithm for interference mitigation","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07556S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6271776,"authors":[{"name":"Shaorui Li","affiliation":["Brockhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shaorui","lastName":"Li","id":"37405420400"},{"name":"Deping Huang","affiliation":["Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Deping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534332400"},{"name":"Jinghong Chen","affiliation":["Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jinghong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280671100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271776","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":910},"abstract":"A current-mode passive mixer with conversion gain that is robust to process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations is presented.

The brain processes these data using networks of neurons that communicate by asynchronous spikes, a technology that is dramatically different from conventional electronic systems. We report here a step towards constructing electronic systems with analogous performance to the brain. Our VLSI spiking neural network combines in real-time three distinct sources of input data; each is place-encoded on an individual neuronal population that expresses soft Winner-Take-All dynamics. These arrays are combined according to a user-specified function that is embedded in the reciprocal connections between the soft Winner-Take-All populations and an intermediate shared population. The overall network is able to perform function approximation (missing data can be inferred from the available streams) and cue integration (when all input streams are present they enhance one another synergistically). The network performs these tasks with about 80% and 90% reliability, respectively. Our results suggest that with further technical improvement, it may be possible to implement more complex probabilistic models such as Bayesian networks in neuromorphic electronic systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time inference in a VLSI spiking neural network","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271788","endPage":"2428","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271788.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"2425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Function approximation","Neuromorphics","Real time systems","Bayesian methods","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","function approximation","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time inference","VLSI","spiking neural network","motor output","brain","asynchronous spike","soft winner-take-all dynamics","function approximation","probabilistic model","Bayesian network","neuromorphic electronic system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time inference in a VLSI spiking neural network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271788/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12946539","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time inference in a VLSI spiking neural network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067296S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6271792,"authors":[{"name":"Eero Lehtonen","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Eero","lastName":"Lehtonen","id":"37304197400"},{"name":"Jussi Poikonen","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking (Comnet), Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Poikonen","id":"37287483100"},{"name":"Mika Laiho","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"Laiho","id":"37270811800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271792","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Boolean functions","Input variables","Educational institutions","Resistance","Impedance","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","memristors","parity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristors","implication logic synthesis","complementary representation","multiinput operation","computational sequences","Boolean function","three-input parity function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271792","abstract":"We propose three new synthesis methods for memristive implication logic and compare these with each other and with a basic method which was originally proposed in [5].

The gains of using such a memristor-based modulator mainly stem from replacing memory blocks and many of the switching components typically used in compressive sensing. We discuss some of these benefits and the design considerations that need to be addressed in memristor-based compressive sensing architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271793","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271793.pdf","startPage":"2445","endPage":"2448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A memristor-based random modulator for compressive sensing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A memristor-based random modulator for compressive sensing systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946544","htmlLink":"/document/6271793/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A memristor-based random modulator for compressive sensing systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086048S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271800,"authors":[{"name":"Rashid Iqbal","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Iqbal","id":"38468575600"},{"name":"Pascal Meinerzhagen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Meinerzhagen","id":"37541302100"},{"name":"Andreas Burg","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Burg","id":"37268709200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271800","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Random access memory","Subthreshold current","CMOS integrated circuits","Tin","Voltage control","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","MOSFET","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-port low-power gain-cell storage array","retention time","supply voltage scaling","2-transistor gain-cell storage array","low-power/low-voltage data storage","write bit-line control","supply rails","Spectre simulation","CMOS technology","nominal supply voltage","storage capacity 2 Kbit","size 180 nm"]}],"abstract":"The impact of supply voltage scaling on the retention time of a 2-transistor (2T) gain-cell (GC) storage array is investigated, in order to enable low-power/low-voltage data storage. The retention time can be increased when scaling down the supply voltage for a given access statistics and a given write bit-line (WBL) control scheme. Moreover, for a given supply voltage, the retention time can be further increased by controlling the WBL to a voltage level between the supply rails during idle and read states. These two concepts are proved by means of Spectre simulation of a GC-storage array implemented in 180-nm CMOS technology. The proposed 2-kb storage macro is operated at only 40% of the nominal supply voltage and leverages the GCs to enable two-port operation with a negligible area-increase compared to a single-port implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271800","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271800.pdf","startPage":"2469","endPage":"2472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-port low-power gain-cell storage array: Voltage scaling and retention time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Two-port low-power gain-cell storage array: Voltage scaling and retention time","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271800/","publicationDate":"May 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12946550","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271800/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-port low-power gain-cell storage array: Voltage scaling and retention time","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075065S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6271801,"authors":[{"name":"Amrut Kolhapure","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Amrut","lastName":"Kolhapure","id":"38468327100"},{"name":"Animesh Kumar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Animesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37279684400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271801","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Noise","Integrated circuit modeling","Semiconductor device modeling","Analytical models","Clocks","Quantum cascade lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit reliability","Monte Carlo methods","radiation hardening (electronics)","random processes","SRAM chips","stochastic processes","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hold-operation","switching power-supply noise","SRAM failure-rate","failure mechanism","cosmic neutron","supply-voltage reduction","supply-voltage margin","SRAM cell","standby","radioactivity","circuit-level simulation","random process-variation","Monte-Carlo simulation","stored-bit","transient analysis","UMC CMOS technology","stochastic process","noisy waveform","critical charge","injection-current model","soft-error rate","SER","size 90 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271801","abstract":"SRAM failure-rate, induced by failure mechanisms such as process variations or cosmic neutrons, increases with reduction in the supply-voltage. Thus, appropriate supply-voltage margins must be used to mitigate or control the failure-rate. This work models and analyzes the interaction of two failure-mechanisms in an SRAM cell during the hold-operation (standby): (i) power-supply noise (due to switching at clock-edge) and soft-errors (due to radioactivity). Circuit-level simulations are used to analyze this interaction. The effect of random process-variations is accounted for by Monte-Carlo simulations. An error in stored-bit of SRAM cell is a transient phenomenon. Therefore, transient analysis of soft-error is carried out in the presence of power-supply noise and random process-variations by using circuit-level simulations in the UMC CMOS 90nm technology. A stochastic process based supply-voltage is difficult to model; therefore, a lower-envelope of measured supply-voltage from the literature is used as the noisy waveform. The critical-charge, obtained by using injection-current model of Freeman [1], of an SRAM cell is used to calculate the soft-error rate (SER). Simulation results show that the SER depends on the time-average of the noisy supply-voltage and not on its minimum value. The distribution of critical-charge, due to random process-variations, is estimated using simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271801","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271801.pdf","startPage":"2473","endPage":"2476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM in hold-operation: Modeling the interaction of soft-errors and switching power-supply noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"SRAM in hold-operation: Modeling the interaction of soft-errors and switching power-supply noise","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271801/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946551","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM in hold-operation: Modeling the interaction of soft-errors and switching power-supply noise","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048788S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271802,"authors":[{"name":"Su-Jin Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Su-Jin","lastName":"Cho","id":"38468756300"},{"name":"Jaewoo Ahn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewoo","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37365614700"},{"name":"Hyojin Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyojin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37693587000"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271802","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Clocks","Interference","Time frequency analysis","Timing","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","DRAM chips","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","computer systems","peak bandwidth","data bus busy time","bank busy time","inter-bank interference time","cycle-accurate DRAM model simulator","DRAM clock frequency","performance bottleneck","multibank DRAM system"]}],"abstract":"As the performance of computer systems improves, the peak bandwidth of the DRAM system needs to be increased. In this study, we analyze the performance of multi-bank DRAMs when increasing the clock frequency by employing three metrics: data bus busy time, bank busy time and inter-bank interference time. We use a cycle-accurate DRAM model simulator to quantitatively measure each metric. Increasing the DRAM clock frequency obviously contributes to lowering the data bus busy time. From the analysis result, we find that raising the number of banks is needed when increasing the DRAM clock frequency. However, the inter-bank interference time becomes the performance bottleneck as the number of banks increases. We suggest that future multi-bank DRAM system should tackle this side-effect to efficiently exploit the faster clock frequency.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271802.pdf","startPage":"2477","endPage":"2480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of multi-bank DRAM with increased clock frequency","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of multi-bank DRAM with increased clock frequency","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946552","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271802/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of multi-bank DRAM with increased clock frequency","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052954S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271803,"authors":[{"name":"Suji Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suji","lastName":"Lee","id":"38469048500"},{"name":"Jongpil Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongpil","lastName":"Jung","id":"37405470600"},{"name":"Chong-Min Kyung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chong-Min","lastName":"Kyung","id":"37277218400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271803","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":889},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Phase change random access memory","Cache memory","Memory management","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid cache architecture","SRAM cache","memory technology","heterogeneous memory dies","microprocessor","DRAM","MRAM","PRAM","average memory access time","AMAT","power reduction","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"Recently, hybrid cache architecture has become illuminated.

Each memory structure has the area satisfying the least Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) under a given area condition. Architecture composed of SRAM and MRAM shows 16.9% reduction in average memory access time and 15.2% of power reduction compared with that composed of homogeneous SRAM.

At the core of this work is the use of \u03a3\u0394 encoding techniques to create both the voltage (amplitude) and timing (phase) references, or strobes used in high-speed sampling. Experimental results reveal the sampling time strobe can be programmed over a phase range of 45 degrees with a phase step of 1 degree at a fixed voltage reference.

Simulation results show that the energy consumption of the PA is 3pJ/pulse with a typical current efficiency of 90% at a data rate of 200Mbps.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","CMOS integrated circuits","Pulse shaping methods","Switches","Logic gates","Switching circuits","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","MMIC power amplifiers","radio transmitters","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse shaped power amplifier","dynamic bias switching","IR-UWB transmitters","CMOS transmission gate","switched power amplifier","impulse radio ultra wideband technique","size 65 nm","bandwidth 2.7 GHz","frequency 5 GHz","efficiency 90 percent","bit rate 200 Mbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271817","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271817.pdf","startPage":"2529","endPage":"2532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pulse-shaped power amplifier with dynamic bias switching for IR-UWB transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pulse-shaped power amplifier with dynamic bias switching for IR-UWB transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271817/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271817/","accessionNumber":"12946566","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pulse-shaped power amplifier with dynamic bias switching for IR-UWB transmitters","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036343S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6271825,"authors":[{"name":"Md Shahed Enamul Quadir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Md Shahed","lastName":"Enamul Quadir","id":"37087630280"},{"name":"Mohammad Rafiqul Haider","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Rafiqul","lastName":"Haider","id":"37374960600"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271825","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Gain","CMOS integrated circuits","Inverters","Power demand","MOSFET circuits","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","neurophysiology","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise bioamplifier","multielectrode neural recording systems","CMOS inverter","power consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271825","abstract":"This paper presents an ultra-low-power low-noise bioamplifier for neural recording applications.

A new method for robust beamforming is proposed by minimizing the array output power while controlling the array mainlobe response. Due to the presence of the non-convex response constraints, a new approach based on iteratively linearizing the non-convex constraints is proposed to reformulate the non-convex problem to a series of second-order cone programming (SOCP) subproblems, each of which can be optimally solved by well-established convex optimization techniques.

Parity Check (LDPC) code has been widely used in various communication standards such as WiMAX and DVB-S2. But these continuously-evolving communication standards and the high development cost and low-flexibility of hardwired ASIC solutions have pushed LDPC researchers to turn to more cost-efficient and flexible implementation, and thus the multi-core processor based implementation of LDPC decoder is gaining increasing attention in the last few years. However, the performance of the multi-core processor based implementation is far below the hardwired ASICs, with one of the key reasons that the cost of communication between processors is very high. Three approaches are proposed in this paper to reduce the communication cost, including: optimized algorithm partitioning to reduce communication traffic, utilizing imbalanced communication between tasks to optimize mapping and reduce overall communication distance, and simplified data sending-receiving mechanism to reduce the cost of identifying received data. By using these approaches, the communication time of the proposed implementation of LDPC decoder only accounts for 12.2% of total decoding time, which generally occupies 50% decoding time in the previously reported LDPC decoders on multi-core processors. And our work can achieve better throughput performance under the same hardware condition compared with other state-of-the-art works.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271839","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271839.pdf","startPage":"2609","endPage":"2612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pure software ldpc decoder on a multi-core processor platform with reduced inter-processor communication cost","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A pure software ldpc decoder on a multi-core processor platform with reduced inter-processor communication cost","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271839/","publicationDate":"May 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12946587","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pure software ldpc decoder on a multi-core processor platform with reduced inter-processor communication cost","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047244S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6271840,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian H\u00f6ppner","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"H\u00f6ppner","id":"37543012100"},{"name":"Chenming Shao","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Chenming","lastName":"Shao","id":"38468312900"},{"name":"Holger Eisenreich","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Eisenreich","id":"37393983700"},{"name":"Georg Ellguth","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Ellguth","id":"37393982500"},{"name":"Mario Ander","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Ander","id":"37272016100"},{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcffny","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Ren\u00e9","lastName":"Sch\u00fcffny","id":"37266953100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271840","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":572},"abstract":"This paper presents a power management architecture for MPSoCs that allows fast switching between multiple onchip supply voltage levels per core.

The decoder delivers an excellent error-correcting performance at a 9.76 Mb/s coded throughput, representing a significant improvement of state-of-the-art extended min-sum decoder implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271844/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12946592","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271844/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High-throughput architecture and implementation of regular (2, d<inf>c</inf>) nonbinary LDPC decoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-throughput architecture and implementation of regular (2, d<inf>c</inf>) nonbinary LDPC decoders","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09475S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6271851,"authors":[{"name":"Mathieu Allard","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Allard","id":"38489370200"},{"name":"Patrick Grogan","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Grogan","id":"38111574700"},{"name":"Yvon Savaria","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yvon","lastName":"Savaria","id":"37276922900"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre David","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"David","id":"37597095700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271851","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrics","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Finite impulse response filter","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-level configuration","design methodology","computing fabric","2D mesh architecture","configurable algorithmic token machines","data processing algorithms","FPGA design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Compute Fabric","Design Methodology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271851","abstract":"Large FPGAs require more and more time and expertise to efficiently target custom applications. This paper presents a new methodology based on two configuration levels. At the lowest level, the architecture is fully synthesized, placed and routed by experts to implement a 2-D mesh architecture of configurable algorithmic token machines. At the highest level, the users can program those machines to implement custom processing and routing. The architecture is data driven. The operations are triggered by the arrival of operands, leading to a large and functional pipeline spread over the whole FPGA. This methodology enables the fast implementation of data processing algorithms by people who are not experts in FPGA design, while achieving higher performances than a pure software solution. Two simple examples (FIR and FFT) illustrate the proposed methodology and demonstrate how it is possible to benefit from the expertise encapsulated at low level by just configuring the high level. Another advantage of the proposed methodology is the opportunity to dynamically reconfigure the fabric very quickly to best match the computation requirements at run time.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271851","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271851.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-level configuration for FPGA: A new design methodology based on a computing fabric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Two-level configuration for FPGA: A new design methodology based on a computing fabric","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271851/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946599","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-level configuration for FPGA: A new design methodology based on a computing fabric","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050349S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6271856,"authors":[{"name":"Shanzhen Lan","affiliation":["Information Engineering School, Communication University of China, Beijing, P.R.

There exists a linear function between them.

Our preliminary results, using a training set of two hundred design examples, show that a radial basis functions ANN can learn the provided designs perfectly, but a larger training set is required for definite conclusions regarding the prediction of component values for new designs.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271876","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271876.pdf","startPage":"2741","endPage":"2744","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards neural network-based design of radiofrequency low-noise amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Towards neural network-based design of radiofrequency low-noise amplifiers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12946624","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6271876/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards neural network-based design of radiofrequency low-noise amplifiers","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081209S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6271877,"authors":[{"name":"Rajib Lochan Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Rajib Lochan","lastName":"Das","id":"38469005300"},{"name":"Mrityunjoy Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Mrityunjoy","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37278356500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271877","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":711},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Least squares approximation","Information filters","Matching pursuit algorithms","Filtering algorithms","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","compressed sensing","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse adaptive filter","PNLMS algorithm","proportionate normalized least mean square","compressed sensing","LASSO","basis pursuit","matching pursuit","sparse adaptive algorithms","mean square error","least absolute shrinkage and selection operator","cooperative learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse Adaptive Filter","PNLMS Algorithm","Compressed Sensing","LASSO","Basis Pursuit","Matching Pursuit","Adaptive Convex Combination","Cooperative Learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we provide an overview of the major developments in the area of sparse adaptive filters, starting from the celebrated works on PNLMS algorithm and its several variants to more recent approaches that use compressed sensing framework, more specifically, LASSO and basis pursuit or matching pursuit, to develop sparse adaptive algorithms with improved mean square error and tracking properties.

A MIMO MMSE detector requests high performance computing for real-time processing. A pipelined MMSE detector using Strassen's algorithm has been developed in our previous work. However, it consumes significant power and thus, we have to consider a low-power solution to minimize power dissipation. We propose a DVWS MIMO detector which changes a wordlength and a supply voltage simultaneously with fixed clock frequency.

In our previous work, a CS-based speech enhancement algorithm has been proposed. However, several issues concerning speech sparsity have not yet been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we focus on studying the following issues: (1) the sparsity of clean speech and audio signals; (2) the sparsity of various noise signals; (3) analysis of the capacity of two sparse transforms i.e., wavelet and discrete cosine transform (DCT), to explore speech sparsity. In this respect, several measures are proposed to analytically compare the wavelet transform with DCT. We found that (1) signal compressibility is an important factor for the CS-based method.

We also show that when the analog circuits suffer from non-linearities and non-monotonic response of the calibration DACs, the proposed algorithm is still able to find the optimal system solution without getting trapped into local minima. Using measured results obtained from prototype fabricated in a 0.5-\u03bcm CMOS process, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm for the task of: (a) compensating and tracking of offset parameters; and (b) calibration of the center frequency of a sub-threshold gm-C biquad filter.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271916","startPage":"2885","endPage":"2888","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271916.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u03a3\u0394 gradient-descent learning for online real-time calibration of digitally-assisted analog circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Analog circuits","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency modulation","Real time systems","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","biquadratic filters","CMOS integrated circuits","digital signal processing chips","digital-analogue conversion","gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u03a3\u0394 gradient-descent learning","online real-time calibration","digitally-assisted analog circuit","on-chip digital-to-analog converter","DSP based algorithm","quantization noise","quantized gradient-descent approach","nonmonotonic response","calibration DAC","CMOS process","subthreshold gm-C biquad filter","size 0.5 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"\u03a3\u0394 gradient-descent learning for online real-time calibration of digitally-assisted analog circuits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946663","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u03a3\u0394 gradient-descent learning for online real-time calibration of digitally-assisted analog circuits","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054743S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6271917,"authors":[{"name":"Dzmitry Maliuk","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Maliuk","id":"37545633900"},{"name":"Yiorgos Makris","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Makris","id":"37274481400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271917","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271917","abstract":"On-chip trainable neural networks show great promise in enabling various desired features of modern integrated circuits (IC), such as Built-In Self-Test (BIST), security and trust monitoring, self-healing, etc. Cost-efficient implementation of these features imposes strict area and power constraints on the circuits dedicated to neural networks, which, however, should not compromise their ability to learn fast and retain functionality throughout their lifecycle. To this end, we have designed and fabricated a reconfigurable analog neural network (ANN) chip which serves as an expertise acquisition platform for various applications requiring on-chip ANN integration. With this platform, we intend to address the key cost-efficiency issues: a fully analog implementation with strict area and power budgets, a learning ability of the proposed architecture, fast dynamic programming of the weight memory during training, and high precision non-volatile storage of weight coefficients during operation or standby. We explore two learning structures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and an ontogenic neural network with their corresponding training algorithms. The core circuits are biased in weak inversion and make use of the translinear principle for multiplication and non-linear conversion operations. The chip is mounted on a custom PCB and connected to a computer for chip-in-the-loop training. We present measured results of the core circuits and the dual-mode weight memory. The learning ability is evaluated on a 3-input XOR classification task.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271917","startPage":"2889","endPage":"2892","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International

By applying a floating threshold scheme to the quasi-Gaussian kernel, the kernel can extend its tail region adaptively according to the characteristics of input data. As a result, the misclassification problem due to the zero tail region in the quasi-Gaussian kernel has been completely eliminated, and the classification accuracy is significantly improved. Software simulation showed the performance is comparable to complex Gaussian-kernel Support Vector Machines. A proof-of-concept chip implementing an analog on-chip-trainable multi-class classifier which employs 64-dimensional self-adaptive quasi-Gaussian circuits was designed in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology and is now under fabrication.

The classical neural network based methodology is impractical to implement since in order to increase the size of the memory, the number of information bits stored per memory bit (efficiency) approaches zero. In addition, the length of a message to be stored and retrieved needs to be the same size as the number of nodes in the network causing the total number of messages the network is capable of storing (diversity) to be limited. Recently, a novel algorithm based on sparse clustered neural networks has been proposed that achieves nearly optimal efficiency and large diversity.

Various parallel coding methods have been proposed. In this paper, we present a parallel transcoding system over Map/Reduce cloud computing architecture. Input video sequences are divided into segments, and mapped to multiple computers. The sub-tasks are launched in parallel with processing results concatenated to the final output sequences. For heterogeneous clips, computing capacity, and task-launching overhead, the task scheduling over cloud is an NP-hard problem. We propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm, Max-MCT, to find out the optimal solutions for task scheduling. By estimating the low-bound of finish time, we transform the problem into a virtual knapsack problem. But it is not an optimal solution for the original problem therefore we use a minimal complete time (MCT) algorithm to minimize the entire finish time. We carry out extensive experiments on numerical simulations. The results verified that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelizing video transcoding using Map-Reduce-based cloud computing","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271923","startPage":"2905","endPage":"2908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271923.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Parallelizing video transcoding using Map-Reduce-based cloud computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271923/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946670","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelizing video transcoding using Map-Reduce-based cloud computing","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p2905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058585S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6271934,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya Lakys","affiliation":["LIEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","UMR 8622, CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Yahya","lastName":"Lakys","id":"37409930600"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["LIEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","UMR 8622, CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37536930400"},{"name":"Jacques-Olivier Klein","affiliation":["LIEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","UMR 8622, CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Jacques-Olivier","lastName":"Klein","id":"37276514100"},{"name":"Claude Chappert","affiliation":["LIEF, University Paris Sud, Orsay, France","UMR 8622, CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Chappert","id":"37315626200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271934","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Table lookup","Flip-flops","Switching circuits","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetoelectronics","MRAM devices","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAM crossbar","configurable logic block","spintronics-based nonvolatile storage devices","reconfigurable circuits","conventional flash memories","SRAM memories","low logic density","high standby power","long reboot latency","compact design","magnetic RAM crossbar architecture","mixed CMOS/magnetic spice simulations","fully dynamic reconfiguration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Context switching","Crossbar architecture","MTJ","MRAM","Non-Volatile","Spintronics"]}],"abstract":"Spintronics-based non-volatile storage devices promise great potential to be integrated in reconfigurable circuits to overcome the major hurdles related to conventional flash and SRAM memories, such as low logic density, high standby power and long (re) boot latency.

Unlike previous proposals, the calibration algorithm introduced here is used to jointly compensate for sampling-time and channel skew errors. Estimates of the gradient of the mean squared error (MSE) or the bit error rate (BER) with respect to the sampling phases of the different signal lanes and interleaves are computed and used to iteratively minimize a cost function (i.e., MSE or BER). Computer simulations demonstrate the excellent behavior of the proposed compensation technique. The calibration algorithm can be implemented with minimal hardware requirements and with a slow clock.

The design task is even more complex due to the non-linear behavior of the quantizer. Typically, a linearized model of the quantizer is used to obtain linear equations that predict the performance of the modulator, which may cause significant discrepancies between the predicted and actual behavior of \u03a3\u0394Ms. To better predict the behavior of a given design solution, we propose a design methodology for \u03a3\u0394Ms based on a genetic algorithm (GA) that uses both linear equations and simulations: the design solution is evaluated using the equations and, if the performance is good enough, it will be evaluated trough simulation. This hybrid cost function allows to use a GA with a large population and, therefore, obtains the best possible design solution. The hybrid cost function takes thermal noise, quantization noise, voltage swing variations and stability of the modulator into account. Furthermore, it also selects the design solution that is the most insensitive to component variations.

Low-power LDPC decoder design is becoming increasingly important for wireless and other power-constraint systems. Compared to disabling or simplifying the decoder circuit, reducing the power supply voltage can bring more power reduction. Through predicting the number of iterations needed for convergence, this paper proposes to make full use of the time available for decoding and scale down the power supply voltage in the remaining decoding iterations. Novel iteration prediction schemes are developed. The proposed schemes require very small hardware overhead and do not lead to noticeable error-correcting performance loss. Compared to using the original supply voltage and powering off the decoder after convergence, the proposed schemes can bring 50% dynamic power reduction for an example LDPC code, and the power saving further increases with the signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271960","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271960.pdf","startPage":"3041","endPage":"3044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power LDPC decoding based on iteration prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-power LDPC decoding based on iteration prediction","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6271960/","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946707","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6271960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power LDPC decoding based on iteration prediction","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p3041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037147S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6271960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6271964,"authors":[{"name":"Merwan Birem","affiliation":["LAboratoire des Sciences et Matriaux pour lElectronique et lAutomatique, UMR 6602 CNRS, Universite Blaise Pascal, Aubiere, France"],"firstName":"Merwan","lastName":"Birem","id":"38468302000"},{"name":"Franois Berry","affiliation":["LAboratoire des Sciences et Matriaux pour lElectronique et lAutomatique, UMR 6602 CNRS, Universite Blaise Pascal, Aubiere, France"],"firstName":"Franois","lastName":"Berry","id":"37339685500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6271964","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Detectors","Field programmable gate arrays","Sorting","Real time systems","Smart cameras","Junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","intelligent sensors","object tracking","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based real time extraction","visual features","intelligent sensor","smart sensor","smart camera","robotics","feature extraction","object tracking","autonomous navigation","3D mapping","interest points feature","processing device","Harris & Stephen algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Processing","Point of interest","Harris & Stephen","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","VHDL","Hardware Implementation"]}],"abstract":"Over the past few years, a new category of sensor is emerging.

The reduction of supply voltage will reduce the power consumption effectively. However, the timing violation will be happened when the voltage overscaling (VOS) is applied. Fortunately, the stochastic logic has simple hardware structure, and the critical path is short. Thus, we can use stochastic logic as the error control (EC) module to mitigate the soft error by the VOS. Compared with traditional EC based low power DSP, the proposed method can achieve higher energy efficiency with high performance. According to the case study of a 26-tap FIR filter, the stochastic logic based EC module can achieve 65% power saving within 2.5dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss, which outperforms 6dB than traditional RPR method. When the soft error for each logic gate is considered, the advantage of SFIR based system is more obvious than traditional method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on

Several techniques are adopted to implement a low power high dynamic range ADC. Firstly, a single-stage inverter replaces the commonly used differential amplifier, in order to reduce the static current. Secondly, the normal NMOS transistor in the inverter stage is replaced by a high threshold device. As a result, with the same transistor size and supply voltage, the gain of the inverter can be enhanced while the short circuit current can be reduced. Thirdly, the charge leakage due to the forward-based parasitic diode is eliminated by using a charge protection switch and rearranged reference scheme. The proposed \u03a3\u0394 ADC is implemented and fabricated using TSMC 0.18\u03bcm technology. The simulation result shows that for a 1.8V supply, 25MHz sampling frequency and 125 oversampling ratio, the power consumption is 63.7\u03bcW and 116\u03bcW, dynamic range is 80dB and 83dB, the ENOB is 11.5 and 11.7bit for a single-ended and a pseudo-differential configurations, respectively. The presented ADC scheme can be applied in a Full HD image sensor running at up to 50 frames/s.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271975","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06271975.pdf","startPage":"3094","endPage":"3097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"80dB dynamic range 100KHz bandwidth inverter-based \u03a3\u0394 ADC for CMOS image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6271975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreNote":"As originally published there was an error in this document.

In this paper, we investigate a fast, accurate and low-complexity method for estimation of static gain and sample-time mismatches. The proposed technique uses a calibration signal generated on-chip through a sinusoidal oscillator inserted into a phase-locked loop (PLL), similarly as the sampling clock signal is usually generated in these high speed conversion systems. We synchronize these two PLLs to allow efficient frequency domain computations, without resorting to windowing, from which accurate estimations are feasible.

The performance of the developed method is analysed mathematically and illustrated by a numerical example.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272007.pdf","startPage":"3210","endPage":"3213","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient multidimensional sampling scheme for Fourier transform estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Estimation","Frequency estimation","Convergence","Spectral analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional sampling scheme","multidimensional Fourier transform estimation","convergence rate","signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient multidimensional sampling scheme for Fourier transform estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946754","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient multidimensional sampling scheme for Fourier transform estimation","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p3210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040901S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6272013,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Toft","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Toft","id":"38468486900"},{"name":"Niclas Rousk","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Rousk","id":"38468385400"},{"name":"Jonas M\u00e5rtensson","affiliation":["Acreo AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"M\u00e5rtensson","id":"37284885500"},{"name":"Marco Forzati","affiliation":["Acreo AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Forzati","id":"37284884000"},{"name":"Bengt-Erik Olsson","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Ericsson Research, Molndal, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bengt-Erik","lastName":"Olsson","id":"37266269000"},{"name":"Per Larsson-Edefors","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Larsson-Edefors","id":"38273921500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272013","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Finite impulse response filter","Bit error rate","Equalizers","Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","field programmable gate arrays","optical receivers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based equalizer","optical fiber receivers","16-QAM1decision directed equalizer","delay requirement","critical phase recovery feedback loop","bit rate 112 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"With ever increasing demands on spectral efficiency, complex modulation schemes are being introduced in fiber communication.

In this work, we present a flexible circuit optimization tool for analog designs which relies on evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we employ logistic functions to determine the fittest individuals. The benchmarking test shows that the program is able to dimension an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) based on the topology netlist in less than 15 minutes, without resorting to any knowledge base, initial guess or simplified models.

An adaptive OFDM system for Cognitive radio has the ability to nullify unnecessary individual carriers and avoid interference to licensed primary users. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) block forms the core of OFDM design. But, the zero valued inputs outnumber the non-zero valued inputs in the FFT block making the standard FFT algorithms computationally inefficient due to wasted operation on zero values. To overcome this problem, several pruning algorithms have been developed. But many of them are architecturally inefficient for FPGA implementation due to complexity of the overhead operations. Moreover, these algorithms are not suitable for applications like Cognitive radio which has zero inputs in arbitrary distributions making hardware implementation to be complex. This paper presents a novel and efficient dynamically partial reconfigurable (DPR) Transform Decomposition (TD) FFT and Radix 2 based IFFT pruning for OFDM based Cognitive Radio on FPGA. Tested FPGA results on XC2VP30 for the DPR method show the configuration time improvement, good area and power efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272028.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic partial reconfigurable FFT/IFFT pruning for OFDM based Cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Field programmable gate arrays","Transforms","Heuristic algorithms","OFDM","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic partial reconfigurable FFT pruning","dynamic partial reconfigurable IFFT pruning","OFDM based cognitive radio","spectrum utilization","adaptive OFDM system","interference","fast Fourier transform","FFT block","nonzero valued inputs","standard FFT algorithms","pruning algorithms","FPGA implementation","arbitrary distributions","hardware implementation","dynamically partial reconfigurable","transform decomposition","TD FFT","Radix 2 based IFFT pruning","XC2VP30","DPR method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic partial reconfigurable FFT/IFFT pruning for OFDM based Cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272028/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946775","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic partial reconfigurable FFT/IFFT pruning for OFDM based Cognitive radio","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057733S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6272029,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Yao","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Yao","id":"38247498200"},{"name":"Guangmin Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangmin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37065392000"},{"name":"Wen-Yen Lin","affiliation":["Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Yen","lastName":"Lin","id":"38238907100"},{"name":"Wen-Cheng Chou","affiliation":["Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Cheng","lastName":"Chou","id":"38236771200"},{"name":"Kin Fong Lei","affiliation":["Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kin Fong","lastName":"Lei","id":"37851895300"},{"name":"Ming-Yih Lee","affiliation":["Healthy Aging Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Yih","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336247700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272029","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel inclination sensing system, which is composed of an inexpensive and low power microcontroller with a 3-Axis digital accelerometer. Accelerometers have been widely used to determine the inclination or tilt angles of a system by calculating angles between gravity vector and its three axes. However, the angle calculation is so complicated that in most previous research work it is usually finished off-line on a more powerful computation resource, such as a PC/PDA or implemented with expensive memory lookup-tables. In the proposed system, we design and implement a novel algorithm on the embedded microcontroller such that the system is capable of transferring the raw data of the accelerometer from motion domain

However, as technology node advances, various scaling barriers newly appeared and reliability characteristics of NAND flash such as endurance and data retention deteriorated. Maximum Vth of a programmed cell becomes lower with scaling down, resulting in insufficient program window for MLC operation. Floating gate (FG) and inter-poly dielectric (IPD) structure must be carefully optimized to maximize saturated level of programmed Vth. The tight control of Vth distribution is one of the main issues in scaling for reliability margin. By decreasing depletion in floating gate and control gate (CG), widening of cell Vth distribution width can be efficiently suppressed. The effect of traps in gate oxide to reliability increases with the decrease in cell dimension. To lower interface trap of gate oxide, hydrogen reducing back-end-of line (BEOL) process is introduced. By using new BEOL process, endurance and data retention characteristics are drastically enhanced. In this paper, we will present the major scaling issues and integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory for 2Ynm generation and beyond.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Reliability","Logic gates","Nonvolatile memory","Hydrogen","Interference","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits","semiconductor device reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integration technology","NAND flash memory","2Y nm generation","high-density memory","scaling barrier","reliability characteristic","floating gate","interpoly dielectric structure","IPD structure","control gate","cell Vth distribution width","interface trap","gate oxide","hydrogen reducing back-end-of line","BEOL process","data retention characteristic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272054","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272054","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272054.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272054","startPage":"424","endPage":"427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272054/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272054/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946801","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043487S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6272055,"authors":[{"name":"Hariprasath Venkatram","affiliation":["EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Hariprasath","lastName":"Venkatram","id":"37847756900"},{"name":"Taehwan Oh","affiliation":["EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Taehwan","lastName":"Oh","id":"37069274300"},{"name":"Jon Guerber","affiliation":["EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Guerber","id":"37391949600"},{"name":"Un-Ku Moon","affiliation":["EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Un-Ku","lastName":"Moon","id":"37276672400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272055","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Latches","Stability analysis","Power demand","Bandwidth","Transconductance","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","amplifiers","analogue processing circuits","feedback","flip-flops","harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class A+ amplifier","controlled positive feedback","discrete-time signal processing circuits","cross-coupled latches","amplification phase","THD performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272055","abstract":"This paper demonstrates Class-A+ amplifier as an alternative to Class-A amplifier for discrete-time signal processing circuits.

GA mimics the nature evolution to optimize complicated problems and in theory optimum solutions can be obtained with infinite computation time. However, in practical filter design problem, when the filter specification is stringent, requiring high filter order and wide coefficient wordlength, GA often fails to find feasible solutions, because the discrete search space thus constructed is huge and majority of the solution candidates therein can not meet the specification. In the proposed GA, the discrete search space is partitioned into smaller ones. Each of the small space is constructed surrounding an optimum continuous solution with a floating passband gain. This increases the chances for the GA to find feasible solutions, but not sacrificing the coverage of the search space. In addition, the search in the multiple spaces can run in parallel, and thus the computation time for the design of filters under consideration reduces significantly. Design examples show that the proposed GA outperforms existing algorithms dealing with the similar problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272061/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12946808","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272061/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of high order and wide coefficient wordlength multiplierless FIR filters with low hardware cost using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of high order and wide coefficient wordlength multiplierless FIR filters with low hardware cost using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070056S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6272067,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel A.

A design methodology is presented to optimize the asymmetrically ground-gated 6T SRAM circuits for achieving the highest overall electrical quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-custom design of low leakage data preserving ground gated 6T SRAM cells to facilitate single-ended write operations","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272070","startPage":"484","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272070.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Full-custom design of low leakage data preserving ground gated 6T SRAM cells to facilitate single-ended write operations","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272070/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946817","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-custom design of low leakage data preserving ground gated 6T SRAM cells to facilitate single-ended write operations","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056677S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6272072,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Kumm","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kumm","id":"37396252100"},{"name":"Peter Zipf","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Zipf","id":"37273343400"},{"name":"Mathias Faust","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Faust","id":"37410393400"},{"name":"Chip-Hong Chang","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chip-Hong","lastName":"Chang","id":"37276902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272072","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Field programmable gate arrays","Optimization","Pipeline processing","Registers","Signal processing algorithms","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","graph theory","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined adder graph optimization","high speed multiple constant multiplication","direct optimization","optimization opportunities","pipelined multiple constant multiplication","limited adder depth","PMCM problem","RPAG","flexible cost evaluation","FPGA","ASIC"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the direct optimization of pipelined adder graphs (PAGs) for high speed multiple constant multiplication (MCM).

To demonstrate an application, electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure detection and analysis is mapped onto the cores. The individual cores are based on a 5 stage RISC pipeline architecture optimized to support communication to other cores on the platform. To reconfigure the platform, programs are loaded onto each of the cores. Communication between cores is implemented using low-area routers that partitions computational cores into hierarchical clusters resulting in a low network diameter. The routers use a packet-switched protocol that minimizes circuitry which further reduces circuit size in comparison to the computational circuitry. A globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) architecture is implemented to eliminate global clock routing which consumes high levels of power due to long propagation and thus high capacitive loading from many cores. Additionally, cores not configured for an application has its local clock disabled which turns off unused cores. The overall result is a platform with lower power consumption than a traditional single core DSP with the reconfigurability lacking in an ASIC. Applications tested within the mapping include the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. The seizure detection and analysis algorithm, when mapped onto the many-core platform, takes 5663 cycles to execute in 14.45 \u03bcs. The prototype SoC is implemented in 65 nm CMOS which contains 64 cores and occupies 8.41 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272092","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272092.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A many-core platform implemented for multi-channel seizure detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272092/","displayDocTitle":"A many-core platform implemented for multi-channel seizure detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946839","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272092/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A many-core platform implemented for multi-channel seizure detection","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09481S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6272095,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Tien Bui","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi, Chicoutimi, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Hung Tien","lastName":"Bui","id":"37276921600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272095","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Encoding","Prediction algorithms","Clocks","Humans","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","field programmable gate arrays","genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined FPGA design","Goertzel algorithm","exon prediction","clock cycles","Cyclone II FPGA","DE2 board","logic elements","embedded multipliers","frequency 50 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for implementing the Goertzel algorithm for exon prediction.

In this technique, the cost associated with the final digital filter data-path is minimized for obtaining combined area-cum-time optimal digital filter data-paths subject to user-specified constraints on the number of the required arithmetic functional units. In the proposed technique, the digital filter data-path encoding is achieved by combining the information regarding the operation scheduling together with the information regarding the allocation and binding of operations to arithmetic functional units into a single particle. The scheduling, and allocation and binding information form the coordinate values of the particles in PSO. The salient feature of the resulting PSO technique is its fast convergence speed, achieved by ensuring that the (random) movement of the particles in the search space in the course of optimization are automatically guaranteed to preserve the data-dependency relationships in the original digital filter signal flow-graph without any recourse to backtracking. The usefulness of the proposed PSO technique is demonstrated through the application of it to the high-level synthesis of a benchmark elliptic wave digital filter. It is observed that the application of the PSO leads to substantially faster convergence speeds as compared to the corresponding genetic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272097","startPage":"580","endPage":"583","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272097.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel particle swarm optimization for high-level synthesis of digital filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Resource management","Encoding","Adders","Registers","Multiplexing","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","digital filters","high level synthesis","particle swarm optimisation","scheduling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level synthesis","digital filters","discrete particle swarm optimization technique","PSO technique","combined area-cum-time optimal digital filter data-paths","user-specified constraints","required arithmetic functional units","digital filter data-path encoding","operation scheduling","operation allocation","operation binding","coordinate values","salient feature","random movement","search space","data-dependency relationships","digital filter signal flow-graph","backtracking","benchmark elliptic wave digital filter","convergence speeds","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel particle swarm optimization for high-level synthesis of digital filters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272097/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946844","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel particle swarm optimization for high-level synthesis of digital filters","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067813S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6272112,"authors":[{"name":"Anuroop Vidapalapati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, USA"],"firstName":"Anuroop","lastName":"Vidapalapati","id":"38468688900"},{"name":"Vineeth Vijayakumaran","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, USA"],"firstName":"Vineeth","lastName":"Vijayakumaran","id":"38468742000"},{"name":"Amlan Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, USA"],"firstName":"Amlan","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37544479300"},{"name":"Andres Kwasinski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, USA"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Kwasinski","id":"37280511500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272112","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Multiaccess communication","Switches","Antennas","Topology","Transmitters","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","network-on-chip","radio links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NoC architecture","wireless links","multihop data transfer","networks-on-chips","energy dissipation","long-range millimeter-wave wireless interconnects","wireless channels","media access control","shared wireless medium","traffic-adaptive code division multiple access scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoC","Wireless Interconnect","CDMA"]}],"abstract":"Multi-hop data transfer in conventional Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) results in lower rates of data transfer and higher energy dissipation.

Motion activities are intrinsically (on-chip) segmented by the sensor, such that activity, gesture recognition and tracking can be intuitively and efficiently performed. In this work, we investigated the applicability of this sensor for gesture recognition. We developed a machine learning method based on the Hidden Markow Model for training and automated classifications of gestures using the event data generated by the sensor. By training eight different activities (dance figures) with 15 persons we build up a library of 580 recorded activities.

The system consists of (1) two optical detector chips with 304\u00d7240 event-driven pixels which are only sensitive to relative light intensity changes, (2) an FPGA for interfacing the detectors, early data processing, and stereo matching for depth map reconstruction, (3) a digital signal processor for interpreting the sensor data in real-time for fall recognition, and (4) a wireless communication module for instantly alerting caring institutions. This system was designed for incident detection in private homes of elderly to foster safety and security. The two main advantages of the system, compared to existing wearable systems are from the application's point of view: (a) the stationary installation has a better acceptance for independent living comparing to permanent wearing devices, and (b) the privacy of the system is systematically ensured since the vision detector does not produce real images such as classic video sensors. The system can actually process about 300 kevents per second. It was evaluated using 500 fall cases acquired with a stuntman. More than 90% positive detections were reported. We will show a live demonstration during ISCAS2012 of the sensor system and its capabilities.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems

Key blocks of the proposed readout circuit consist of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) block and an 11-bit SAR-ADC. In whole sensing sequence, the TIA block converts sensing currents of 64-channel CNT sensors into corresponding voltage levels through 64 active input current mirrors (AICMs) and a shared variable gain amplifier (VGA). This amplification method uses only one VGA requiring a high power consumption and large area for passive elements. Therefore, the proposed two-stage amplification method can be designed with small area and low power.

To further reduce the power consumption, the sampling clock in the first multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) is split into two phases to reduce the gain-bandwidth (GBW) requirement of the flash ADC without sacrificing the opamp settling time.

This alleviates the sampling requirements in advanced acquisition systems, such as the direct-sampling solution to the software-defined radio paradigm. Unfortunately, beyond the theorem of bandpass sampling, analytical expressions for these valid sub-sampling rates are unavailable. Previously, the authors derived the analytical rules which guarantee that the minimum sub-Nyquist sampling frequency avoids aliasing. However, these equations are only valid for the restricted case of evenly-spaced equal-bandwidth multichannel systems, being useless in a broader framework with arbitrary-bandwidth channels. In this work, the general dual-band case is exhaustively analyzed. Given the channel bandwidths, the spectrum parameters which assure that the minimum sub-Nyquist frequency does not give rise to aliasing may be found. For more-than-two channels, some simple guidelines are also provided. Finally, simulation examples are shown to confirm the correctness of the deduced equations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272169","startPage":"830","endPage":"833","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272169.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition of multiband signals with minimum sub-Nyquist sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of multiband signals with minimum sub-Nyquist sampling","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272169/","accessionNumber":"12946916","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272169/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of multiband signals with minimum sub-Nyquist sampling","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038964S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6272173,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Coulombe","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, CNRS-INRIA-INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Montpelher II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Coulombe","id":"37427728400"},{"name":"Olivier Rossel","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, CNRS-INRIA-INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Montpelher II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Rossel","id":"38108613400"},{"name":"Serge Bernard","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, CNRS-INRIA-INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Montpelher II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Bernard","id":"37268731100"},{"name":"Fabien Soulier","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, CNRS-INRIA-INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Montpelher II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Soulier","id":"37395421300"},{"name":"Guy Cathebras","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, CNRS-INRIA-INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Montpelher II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Cathebras","id":"37268669700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272173","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Transistors","Noise reduction","Transconductance","Electrodes","Power demand","Crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","BiCMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared input transconductance amplifier architecture","enhanced noise power efficiency","parallel biosignal recordings","noise power tradeoff","front end amplifiers","parallel recording application","differential readout","supply current savings","power penalty","ENG recordings","BiCMOS process","differential amplifiers","equivalent output noise","power consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272173","abstract":"A method for enhancing the noise-power tradeoff of front-end amplifiers in parallel recording applications is proposed. The circuit uses shared-input transconductance amplifiers and differential readout to attenuate correlated noise between parallel outputs, resulting in significant supply current savings without noise penalty. Also, a method for reducing the remaining noise with little power penalty is proposed. The potential benefits of combining both methods and the related trade-offs are discussed and validated by simulations on a sample design intended for ENG recordings, using models of a 0.35\u03bcm BiCMOS process. It is shown that the total supply current can be reduced by more than 50% that of a comparable system using conventional differential amplifiers with equivalent output noise. Alternatively, the noise can be reduced by approximately 35% with comparable power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272173","startPage":"846","endPage":"849","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272173.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new shared-input amplifier architecture with enhanced noise-power efficiency for parallel biosignal recordings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new shared-input amplifier architecture with enhanced noise-power efficiency for parallel biosignal recordings","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272173/","accessionNumber":"12946920","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272173/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new shared-input amplifier architecture with enhanced noise-power efficiency for parallel biosignal recordings","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044614S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6272175,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The conventional technique of increasing transistor gate dimensions to reduce offset has become more difficult to implement due to the limitations on channel length and the growing negative impact on performance in the latest technology nodes.

It is found that for practical design values, the size of the level-shifting capacitor only weakly influences noise performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Transistors","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitance","Capacitors","Gain","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","operational amplifiers","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlated level shifting","noise performance","switched capacitor circuits","opamp noise","level shifting capacitor","split-CLS switched capacitor amplification circuit","general CLS architectures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272200","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272200.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of correlated level shifting on noise performance in switched capacitor circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of correlated level shifting on noise performance in switched capacitor circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272200/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272200/","accessionNumber":"12946946","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of correlated level shifting on noise performance in switched capacitor circuits","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039262S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6272206,"authors":[{"name":"Da-Long Ming","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Da-Long","lastName":"Ming","id":"38468666400"},{"name":"Yu-Huei Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Huei","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539806100"},{"name":"Ke-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ke-Horng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291295300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0218-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0217-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"CD","value":"0271-4302"}],"articleNumber":"6272206","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high efficiency adaptive frequency hopping controlled 1/3\u00d7 step-down switch capacitor DC-DC converter with deep-green mode operation","abstract":"A high efficiency adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) controlled step-down switch capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter with deep-green mode (DGM) operation is proposed for system-on-chip (SoC) applications. To obtain the high power conversion efficiency and the small output voltage ripple over a wide load current range, the proposed driving capability control can modulate the load current driving with the closed-loop operation. The AFH control can dynamically adjust the switching frequency according to the distinct output load conditions, so as to ensure adequate load current supply function as well as output voltage regulation. In addition, the DGM operation can mask the switching clock to reduce power loss at ultra light loads for improving power efficiency. This work is implemented by 40 nm CMOS technology. Simulated results demonstrate that the propped SC converter delivers wide load range from 1mA to 300mA. The power conversion efficiency is achieved over 72 % and the output voltage ripple is guaranteed smaller than 30 mV.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","startPage":"966","endPage":"969","displayPublicationTitle":"2012

The proposed 3-parallel FIR structures exploit the inherent nature of the symmetric coefficients of odd length, according to the length of filter, (N mod 3), reducing half the number of multipliers in subfilter section at the expense of additional adders in preprocessing and postprocessing blocks. The overhead from the additional adders in preprocessing and postprocessing blocks stay fixed, not increasing along with the length of the FIR filter, whereas the number of reduced multipliers increases along with the length of the FIR filter. For example, for a 81-tap filter, the proposed A structure saves 26 multipliers at the expense of 5 adders, whereas for a 591-tap filter, the proposed structure saves 196 multipliers at the expense of 5 adders still. Overall, the proposed 3-parallel FIR structures can lead to significant hardware savings for symmetric coefficients of odd length from the existing FFA parallel FIR filter, especially when the length of the filter is large.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272215","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6257548/6270389/06272215.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6270389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-efficient VLSI implementation for 3-parallel linear-phase FIR digital filter of odd length","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12946961","htmlLink":"/document/6272215/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-efficient VLSI implementation for 3-parallel linear-phase FIR digital filter of odd length","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076113S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6257548","isNumber":"6270389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6257548","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6270389","articleId":"6272215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6272302,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For short single mode fiber (SMF) links, all the modulation schemes offer similar link power budget margins for fiber lengths up to 15 km, but NRZ and PAM-4 are preferable due to their system simplicity and low power consumption.

To this end, we extend our previous work and propose a generalized algorithm that is applicable to UCAs with the sensor number being even as well as odd. Similar to our previous work, the generalized algorithm offers closed-form estimates of azimuth and elevation angles. Thus, it is computationally efficient. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed generalized approach.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2213792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06272311.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2213792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Algorithm for Fast Two-Dimensional Angle Estimation of a Single Source With Uniform Circular Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Algorithm for Fast Two-Dimensional Angle Estimation of a Single Source With Uniform Circular Arrays","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272311/","accessionNumber":"12956773","volume":"11","publicationDate":"2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Algorithm for Fast Two-Dimensional Angle Estimation of a Single Source With Uniform Circular Arrays","sourcePdf":"lawp-liao-2213792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029025S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6272311","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6272323,"authors":[{"name":"Hung X.

Cross-polarized antennas can enhance the channel rank and thus the throughput of such systems especially in case of a line-of-sight (LOS) connection. This requires an exact model of the polarization characteristics. To increase the accuracy of the existing channel models, we propose a new method that predicts the polarization state of a microwave link based on findings in the field of optics. We verified the method by cross-polarized multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) measurements at 2.6 GHz with 16 transmitters and ten receivers in an urban macrocell environment under strong LOS conditions in downtown Berlin, Germany. Comparisons of simulation and measurement results show that the coefficients of the polarized LOS channel can be predicted very well by the new method. Measured capacities at 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were in between 14.2 and 19.1 b/s/Hz-values that can be predicted by the channel model with more than 90% accuracy. This increase in modeling accuracy is an important feature for many applications such as heterogeneous networks, space-to-ground satellite communications, and cooperative communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6365270/06272327.pdf","startPage":"5966","endPage":"5977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2214017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2214017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Geometric Polarization Rotation Model for the 3-D Spatial Channel Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Receiving antennas","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","microwave antenna arrays","microwave links","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","ray tracing","UHF antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric polarization rotation model","3D spatial channel model","3GPP spatial channel model","SCM","WINNER model","ray tracing","multiple-antenna multiple-user techniques","wireless communications","cross-polarized antennas","channel rank enhancement","line-of-sight connection","LOS connection","polarization state prediction","microwave link","cross-polarized multiple-input-multiple-output measurements","MIMO measurements","transmitters","receivers","urban macrocell environment","polarized LOS channel","signal-to-noise ratio","space-to-ground satellite communications","heterogeneous networks","cooperative communications","frequency 2.6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity","cross-polarization ratio (XPR)","dual polarization","measurement","MIMO systems","modeling","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","polarization","radio propagation","spatial channel model (SCM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Geometric Polarization Rotation Model for the 3-D Spatial Channel Model","volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6272327/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13150505","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Geometric Polarization Rotation Model for the 3-D Spatial Channel Model","sourcePdf":"tap-jaeckel-2214017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097702S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6365270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6365270","articleId":"6272327","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6272331,"authors":[{"name":"Zden\u011bk Biolek","affiliation":["Microelectronics Department, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zden\u011bk","lastName":"Biolek","id":"38476990700"},{"name":"Dalibor Biolek","affiliation":["Microelectronics Department, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Defence, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Dalibor","lastName":"Biolek","id":"37332028300"},{"name":"Viera Biolkova","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Viera","lastName":"Biolkova","id":"37332024000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6272331","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":875},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272331","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Hysteresis","Harmonic analysis","Time domain analysis","Shape","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hysteresis","memristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor pinched hysteresis loop","periodical voltage","pinched v -

Studies showed that product codes that employ three-error-correcting Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes can achieve better performance than other BCH or Reed-Solomon codes. For such codes, the Peterson algorithm can be used to compute the error locator polynomial, and its roots can be found directly using a lookup table (LUT). However, the size of the LUT is quite large for finite fields of high order. In this brief, a novel approach is proposed to reduce the LUT size by at least four times through making use of the properties of the error locator polynomial and normal basis representation of finite field elements.

Different from the idea of taking the entropy or contrast as the optimization objective in the presently existing algorithms, this method exploits the intrinsic sparsity distribution of scattering centers to compensate the indeterminacy of the measurement system, and a universal regularization model is constructed to simultaneously balance the measurement errors and the sparsity constraint. Accordingly, an effective iterative algorithm on the basis of solving a matrix equation and a trigonometric equation is proposed to estimate the phase errors, which makes the conventional minimum entropy method (MEM) a special case of the proposed method. Specifically, with the sparsity measure being selected as the logarithm function, an analytic representation is derived for the solution of the matrix equation, and the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed method is also discussed. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the present data-driven algorithms in terms of efficiency and robustness, such as MEM, phase gradient autofocusing algorithm, and maximum contrast method.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2207121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6469260/06272340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2207121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469260","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Representation Based Autofocusing Technique for ISAR Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Representation Based Autofocusing Technique for ISAR Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13343317","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6272340/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Representation Based Autofocusing Technique for ISAR Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-du-2207121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07553S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6469260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6469260","articleId":"6272340","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6272346,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Nicolo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6342844/6272346/6272346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Nicol\u00f2 (S'07) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering from the University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy, in 2002, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from West Virginia University (WVU), Morgantown, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from WVU, in 2012.","In 2002, he was with Thales Communications, Italy, working on wireless networks.

It is able to capture clear long range images of a subject in harsh atmospheric conditions and at night time. However, matching SWIR images against a gallery of color images is a very challenging task. The photometric properties of images in these two spectral bands are highly distinct. This work presents a novel cross-spectral face recognition scheme that encodes images filtered with a bank of Gabor filters followed by three local operators: Simplified Weber Local Descriptor, Local Binary Pattern, and Generalized Local Binary Pattern. Both magnitude and phase of filtered images are encoded. Matching encoded face images is performed by using a symmetric I-divergence. We quantify the verification and identification performance of the cross-spectral matcher on two multispectral face datasets. In the first dataset (PRE-TINDERS), both SWIR and visible gallery images are captured at a close distance (about 2 meters). In the second dataset (TINDERS), the probe SWIR images are collected at longer ranges (50 and 106 meters). The results on PRE-TINDERS dataset form a baseline for matching long range data. We also demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach by comparing its performance with the performance of Faceit G8, a commercial face recognition engine distributed by L1. The results show that the designed method outperforms Faceit G8 in terms of verification and identification rates on both datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2213813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6342844/06272346.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2213813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342844","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long Range Cross-Spectral Face Recognition: Matching SWIR Against Visible Light Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Long Range Cross-Spectral Face Recognition: Matching SWIR Against Visible Light Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136028","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272346/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long Range Cross-Spectral Face Recognition: Matching SWIR Against Visible Light Images","sourcePdf":"tifs-schmid-2213813-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076136S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6272346","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6272347,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Center for Automation Research, UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6342844/6272347/6272347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Wu (S'09) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

It is well known that age and identity information are encoded in both texture and shape of the face. Building on recent advances in landmark extraction and statistical techniques for landmark-based shape analysis, we consider these problems using facial shapes. We show that by using well-defined shape spaces and their associated geometry, one can obtain significant performance improvements in both age estimation and face verification. Toward this end, we propose to model the facial shapes as points on a Grassmann manifold. Age estimation and face verification are then considered as regression and classification problems on this manifold. Algorithms for regression and classification are designed to take into account the geometry of the underlying space. The proposed method is flexible and can be used as a standalone age estimator or classifier, and we also present methods for fusion with texture-based algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136029","htmlLink":"/document/6272347/","displayDocTitle":"Age Estimation and Face Verification Across Aging Using Landmarks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age Estimation and Face Verification Across Aging Using Landmarks","sourcePdf":"tifs-wu-2213812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096673S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6272347","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6272349,"authors":[{"name":"Gwanggil Jeon","affiliation":["The Department of Embedded Systems Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6392254/6272349/6272349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gwanggil Jeon (S'06\u2013M'08) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. (summa cum laude) degrees from the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","He was with the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, from 2008 to 2009.

First, we use normalized local-oriented energies to generate local feature vectors, which describe the local structures distinctively and are less sensitive to imaging conditions. Then, each local feature vector is quantized by self-adaptive quantization thresholds determined in the learning stage using histogram specification, and the quantized local feature vector is transformed to a number by N-nary coding, which helps to preserve more structure information during vector quantization. Finally, the frequency histogram is used as the representation feature. The performance is benchmarked by material categorization on KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS2-a databases. Our method is compared with typical statistical approaches, such as basic image features, local binary pattern (LBP), local ternary pattern, completed LBP, Weber local descriptor, and VZ algorithms (VZ-MR8 and VZ-Joint).

Most of the existing perceptual IQA metrics cannot accurately represent the degradations from different types of distortion, e.g., existing structural similarity metrics perform well on content-dependent distortions while not as well as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on content-independent distortions. In this paper, we integrate the merits of the existing IQA metrics with the guide of the recently revealed internal generative mechanism (IGM). The IGM indicates that the human visual system actively predicts sensory information and tries to avoid residual uncertainty for image perception and understanding. Inspired by the IGM theory, we adopt an autoregressive prediction algorithm to decompose an input scene into two portions, the predicted portion with the predicted visual content and the disorderly portion with the residual content. Distortions on the predicted portion degrade the primary visual information, and structural similarity procedures are employed to measure its degradation; distortions on the disorderly portion mainly change the uncertain information and the PNSR is employed for it. Finally, according to the noise energy deployment on the two portions, we combine the two evaluation results to acquire the overall quality score. Experimental results on six publicly available databases demonstrate that the proposed metric is comparable with the state-of-the-art quality metrics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual Quality Metric With Internal Generative Mechanism","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2214048","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6392254/06272355.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2214048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual Quality Metric With Internal Generative Mechanism","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6272355/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188881","pubMedId":"22910116","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual Quality Metric With Internal Generative Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tip-lin-2214048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134996S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6392254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6392254","articleId":"6272355","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6272356,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Mittal","affiliation":["Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6353618/6272356/6272356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anish Mittal received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India, and the M.S. degree in computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.","He joined the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, in 2009, where he has been an Assistant Director since January 2012.

The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of \u201cnaturalness\u201d in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. A software release of BRISQUE is available online: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/BRISQUE_release.zip for public use and evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2214050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2214050","startPage":"4695","endPage":"4708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6353618/06272356.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"No-Reference Image Quality Assessment in the Spatial Domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"No-Reference Image Quality Assessment in the Spatial Domain","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13115951","pubMedId":"22910118","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272356/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No-Reference Image Quality Assessment in the Spatial Domain","sourcePdf":"tip-mittal-2214050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12987S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6353618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"1884","xplore-issue":"6353618","articleId":"6272356","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6272358,"authors":[{"name":"Kaihua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6392254/6272358/6272358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaihua Zhang received the B.S. degree in technology and science of electronic information from the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, and the Master's degree in signal and information processing from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

A diffusion term is introduced into LSE, resulting in an RD-LSE equation, from which a piecewise constant solution can be derived. In order to obtain a stable numerical solution from the RD-based LSE, we propose a two-step splitting method to iteratively solve the RD-LSE equation, where we first iterate the LSE equation, then solve the diffusion equation. The second step regularizes the level set function obtained in the first step to ensure stability, and thus the complex and costly reinitialization procedure is completely eliminated from LSE. By successfully applying diffusion to LSE, the RD-LSE model is stable by means of the simple finite difference method, which is very easy to implement. The proposed RD method can be generalized to solve the LSE for both variational level set method and partial differential equation-based level set method. The RD-LSE method shows very good performance on boundary antileakage. The extensive and promising experimental results on synthetic and real images validate the effectiveness of the proposed RD-LSE approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2214046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2214046","startPage":"258","endPage":"271","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6392254/06272358.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinitialization-Free Level Set Evolution via Reaction Diffusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reinitialization-Free Level Set Evolution via Reaction Diffusion","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272358/","accessionNumber":"13188883","pubMedId":"22910114","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272358/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinitialization-Free Level Set Evolution via Reaction Diffusion","sourcePdf":"tip-zhang-2214046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144675S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6392254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"6392254","articleId":"6272358","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6272360,"authors":[{"name":"Ilan Shomorony","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Shomorony","id":"38558396400"},{"name":"A.

We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for each case based on network connectivity and a new notion of source-destination paths with manageable interference. Our achievability scheme is based on forwarding the received signals at all nodes, except for a small fraction of them in at most two key layers. Hence, we effectively create a \u201ccondensed network\u201d that has at most four layers (including the sources layer and the destinations layer). We design the transmission strategies based on the structure of this condensed network. The converse results are obtained by developing information-theoretic inequalities that capture the structures of the network connectivity. Finally, we extend this result and characterize the full degrees of freedom region of two-unicast layered wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2214024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6387658/06272360.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2214024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Unicast Wireless Networks: Characterizing the Degrees of Freedom","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272360/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Unicast Wireless Networks: Characterizing the Degrees of Freedom","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187813","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Unicast Wireless Networks: Characterizing the Degrees of Freedom","sourcePdf":"tit-shomorony-2214024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057518S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","isNumber":"6387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","articleId":"6272360","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6272364,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-chu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6410053/6272364/6272364-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-chu Chang (S'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

The deflection of this smart material results from several external factors, such as water distribution and concentration. IPMC strips with a variety of water concentration on the surfaces and the surface conductivity show various deflection patterns. In this paper, IPMC strips in four initial wetness conditions (100%, 50%, 0% wet on the anode surfaces but 100% wet on the cathode surfaces, and the last one submerged in deionized water) were tested. Even without any external excitation, the strips can bend due to nonuniform water distribution. In order to understand the effects of surface conductivity in an aquatic environment, an IPMC strip with two wires connected to two distinct spots was used to demonstrate the power loss due to the surface resistance. Three types of input signals, sawtooth, sinusoidal, and square waves, were used to compare the difference between the input and output signals measured at the two spots. Thick (1 mm) IPMC strips were fabricated and employed in this study to sustain and drive the robot with sufficient forces. Finally, an aquatic walking robot (102 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 43 mm, 39 g) with six 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) legs has been designed, implemented, and walked in water at the speed of 0.5 mm/s. The average power consumption is 8 W per leg. Each leg has a thigh and a shank to generate 2-DOF motions. Each set of three legs walked together as a tripod to maintain the stability in operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6410053/06272364.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2210904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2210904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aquatic Ionic-Polymer-Metal-Composite Insectile Robot With Multi-DOF Legs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strips","Legged locomotion","Anodes","Metals","Surface treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroactive polymer actuators","intelligent materials","legged locomotion","marine vehicles","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aquatic ionic-polymer-metal-composite insectile robot","multiDOF legs","bioinspired systems","fish-like robots","tadpole-like robots","smart material","water distribution","water concentration","IPMC strips","surface conductivity","sawtooth waves","sinusoidal waves","square waves","aquatic walking robot","power 8 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aquatic walking robot","biomimetic robot","ionic-polymer-metal composite (IPMC)","2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) leg"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Aquatic Ionic-Polymer-Metal-Composite Insectile Robot With Multi-DOF Legs","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6272364/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13219927","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aquatic Ionic-Polymer-Metal-Composite Insectile Robot With Multi-DOF Legs","sourcePdf":"tmech-kim-2210904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062878S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6410053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6410053","articleId":"6272364","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6272374,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This, combined with FPGA's low expense, ease of use, and selected dedicated hardware make them an ideal technology for a data acquisition system for a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The University of Washington is producing a high-resolution, small-animal PET scanner that utilizes FPGAs as the core of the front-end electronics. For this scanner, functions that are typically performed in dedicated circuits, or offline, are being migrated to the FPGA. This will not only simplify the electronics, but the features of modern FPGAs can be utilized to add significant signal processing power to produce higher quality images. In this paper we report on an all-digital pulse pile-up correction algorithm that has been developed for the FPGA. The pile-up mitigation algorithm will allow the scanner to run at higher count rates without incurring large data losses due to the overlapping of scintillation signals. This correction technique utilizes a reference pulse to extract timing and energy information for most pile-up events. Using pulses acquired from a Zecotech Photonics MAPD-N with an LFS-3 scintillator, we show that good timing and energy information can be achieved in the presence of pile-up utilizing a moderate amount of FPGA resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6327733/06272374.pdf","startPage":"1823","endPage":"1830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2012.2207403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2012.2207403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6327733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Pulse Pile-Up Correction With Energy and Timing Recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Engines","Field programmable gate arrays","Energy resolution","Positron emission tomography","Signal processing algorithms","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","nuclear electronics","positron emission tomography","readout electronics","semiconductor counters","solid scintillation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based pulse pile-up correction","energy recovery","timing recovery","field programmable gate arrays","complex discrete signal processing algorithms","clock rates","data acquisition system","positron emission tomography","University of Washington","small-animal PET scanner","front-end electronics","signal processing power","all-digital pulse pile-up correction algorithm","pile-up mitigation algorithm","Zecotech Photonics MAPD-N","LFS-3 scintillator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital signal processing","field programmable gate arrays","imaging","integrated circuits","nuclear medicine","parameter estimation","positron emission tomography","signal analysis","time of arrival estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Pulse Pile-Up Correction With Energy and Timing Recovery","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6272374/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13038265","pubMedId":"24265508","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Pulse Pile-Up Correction With Energy and Timing Recovery","sourcePdf":"tns-haselman-2207403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062996S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6327733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6327733","articleId":"6272374","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6272377,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The implementation of such techniques relies on a power supply that is capable of rapidly adjusting the system supply voltage. In this paper, a pulsewidth modulation multiphase topology with magnetic coupling is proposed for its use in voltage modulation techniques. Since the magnetic coupling in this topology is done with transformers instead of coupled inductors, the energy storage is reduced and very fast voltage changes are achieved. Advantages and drawbacks of this topology have been previously presented in the literature and in this paper, the design criteria for implementing a power supply for the envelope elimination and restoration technique in an RF system are presented along with an implementation of the power supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272377/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146873","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transformer-Coupled Converter for Voltage Modulation Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformer-Coupled Converter for Voltage Modulation Techniques","sourcePdf":"tpel-gonzalez-2213843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105137S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6272377","onlineDate":"17 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6272378,"authors":[{"name":"Pasi Nuutinen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6341145/6272378/6272378-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pasi Nuutinen (M\u201911) was born in Finland, in 1981.

In a broader sense, however, green wireless communications could also include wireless communications using environmentally sustainable materials, occupying less land space, accompanying less electromagnetic pollution, together with waste recycling and reducing wastes, and cost reductions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6272411/06272415.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2012.6272415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2012.6272415","startPage":"4","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green wireless communications: from concept to reality [Industry Perspectives]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272415/","displayDocTitle":"Green wireless communications: from concept to reality [Industry Perspectives]","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272415/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green wireless communications: from concept to reality [Industry Perspectives]","sourcePdf":"004LYT-INDUSTRY-Wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042471S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272415","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6272418,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Mueck","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications Group, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Markus Mueck (Markus.Dominik.Mueck@intel.com) received Diploma degrees from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST), Paris, France, and a doctorate degree from ENST in communications.

For this flexible mobile device framework, baseband interfaces are introduced as they are currently discussed in ETSI reconfigurable radio systems standardization. Furthermore, this technical solution is positioned with respect to security requirements and the basic regulatory framework which is currently under revision in Europe. Indeed, the future revised Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive is expected to allow for such advanced reconfiguration, enabling users to acquire and install so-called RadioApps software components which may affect the compliance of a mobile device to the essential requirements of the Directive.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2012.6272418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6272411/06272418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2012.6272418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272411","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future of wireless communication: RadioApps and related security and radio computer framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Future of wireless communication: RadioApps and related security and radio computer framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future of wireless communication: RadioApps and related security and radio computer framework","sourcePdf":"007MUECKLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037962S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272418","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6272421,"authors":[{"name":"Maziar Nekovee","affiliation":["BT RESEARCH and TECHNOLOGY, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Maziar Nekovee (maziar.nekovee@bt.com) has a Ph.D. in physics and an M.

Recently, a number of wireless standards that incorporate CR technology have been finalized or are being developed to standardize systems that will coexist in the same TV white spaces. In these wireless standards, the widely studied problem of primary-secondary network coexistence has been addressed by the use of incumbent geolocation databases augmented with spectrum sensing techniques. However, the challenging problem of secondary-secondary coexistence-in particular, heterogeneous secondary coexistence- has garnered much less attention in the standards and related literature. The coexistence of heterogeneous secondary networks poses challenging problems due to a number of factors, including the disparity of PHY/MAC strategies of the coexisting systems. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms that have been proposed for heterogeneous coexistence, and propose a taxonomy of those mechanisms targeting TVWSs. Through this taxonomy, our aim is to offer a clear picture of the heterogeneous coexistence issues and related technical challenges, and shed light on the possible solution space.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272422/","displayDocTitle":"A taxonomy of coexistence mechanisms for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks operating in TV white spaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A taxonomy of coexistence mechanisms for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks operating in TV white spaces","sourcePdf":"011GAOLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061047S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272422","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6272423,"authors":[{"name":"Sau-Hsuan Wu","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Sau-Hsuan Wu (sauhsuan@cm.nctu.edu.tw) received B.S. and M.S. degrees from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan in 1990 and 1993, respectively, both in engineering science.

On the other hand, the rapid growth of Cloud computing makes it possible and more economical to build a CR metropolitan area network with commodity hardware. In view of the opportunity and challenges brought about by these two technologies, we propose a CR cloud networking model that is able to support CR access in TVWS. Making use of the flexible and vast computing capacity of the cloud, a database and a cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm that estimates the radio power map of licensed users are realized on a CR cloud implemented with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Azure Cloud platform. The CRC can support CSS, dynamic spectrum access and mobility management. A medium access control protocol is also developed for this CRCN model to collect sensing reports and provide access to the TVWS and CRC services. Through this CRCN prototype, important network parameters such as the mean squared errors in CSS, the CR channel vacating delay, and the cloud-based handover time are measured for the design and deployment of the CRCN concept.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2012.6272423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272411","startPage":"49","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6272411/06272423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cloud model and concept prototype for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272423/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A cloud model and concept prototype for cognitive radio networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cloud model and concept prototype for cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"012WULAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044455S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272423","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6272425,"authors":[{"name":"Rahman Doost-Mohammady","affiliation":["Northeastern University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rahman Doost-Mohammady (doost@ece.neu.edu) received his B.Sc. in computer engineering in 2007 from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

However, transmissions in the WMTS band are severely hampered by interferences from adjacent digital television channels, and due to non-uniform access priority, as this band is also shared by utility telemetry and government installations. In this article, we propose the use of cognitive radio technology to dynamically utilize the WMTS frequencies based on the activity patterns of the high priority users, and the quality of service constraints of the patients' data, while ensuring protection to existing higher priority transmissions and the safe operation of sensitive medical equipment. The priority users here are utility telemetry transmissions in certain portions of the WMTS band, government run radar sites, and legacy medical telemetry equipment without cognitive radio capability. We provide the first measurements on the complete WMTS spectrum activity at two major hospital locations in the Boston area, and outline an optimization framework that assigns frequency and transmission power jointly in this setting. The article also discusses the current state of the art and the major challenges in the implementation of this new cognitive radio assisted medical telemetry paradigm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272425/","displayDocTitle":"Transforming healthcare and medical telemetry through cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transforming healthcare and medical telemetry through cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"014DOOST-MOHAMMADYLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047903S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272425","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6272426,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Chavez-Santiago","bio":{"p":["Raul Chavez-santiago (raul.chavez-santiago@rr-research.no) obtained his Ph.D. degree from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, in 2007.

In the United States alone, the telecommunications services market for the healthcare sector is forecast to increase from $7.5 billion in 2008 to $11.3 billion in 2013. Medical body area networks improve the mobility of patients and medical personnel during surgery, accelerate the patients\u2019 recovery, and facilitate the remote monitoring of patients suffering from chronic diseases. Currently, MBANs are being introduced in unlicensed frequency bands, where the risk of mutual interference with other electronic devices can be high. Techniques developed during the evolution of cognitive radio can potentially alleviate these problems in medical communication environments. In addition, these techniques can help increase the efficiency of spectrum usage to accommodate the rapidly growing demand for wireless MBAN solutions and enhance coexistence with other collocated wireless systems. This article proposes a viable architecture of an MBAN with practical CR features based on ultra wideband radio technology. UWB signals offer many advantages to MBANs, and some features of this technology can be exploited for effective implementation of CR. We discuss the physical and MAC layer aspects of the proposal in addition to the implementation challenges.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2012.6272426","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/6272411/06272426.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2012.6272426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio for medical body area networks using ultra wideband","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio for medical body area networks using ultra wideband","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272426/","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6272426/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio for medical body area networks using ultra wideband","sourcePdf":"015BALASINGHAMLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084827S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272426","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6272428,"authors":[{"name":"Perumalraja Rengaraju","affiliation":["Carleton University, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Perumalraja Rengaraju (rpraja@sce.carleton.ca) received his B.Eng. degree from Bharathidasan University and the M.Eng. degree in Communication Systems from Anna University, India, in 2002 and 2006.

Delivering high QoE depends on factors that contribute to the user\u2019s perception of the target services as well as the Quality of Service (QoS) of the network. Although a better network QoS in many cases will result in better QoE, fulfilling all traffic QoS parameters alone may not guarantee satisfied users. On the other hand, if the QoS of the network degrades, the QoE of users' applications could be affected significantly. This article presents an integrated view of End-to- End (E2E) QoS and service assurance support in WiMAX and LTE networks. The integrated view also considers the existing cross-layer implementations to achieve the necessary E2E QoS and how the QoS and QoE should and can be monitored over the network in an E2E fashion. The existing cross-layer implementations ensure the E2E QoS performance before establishing the applications. However, even though the network has strong QoS support, the service providers should still monitor the QoS of the network and QoE of users\u2019 applications accurately to achieve service quality assurance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272428/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On QoE monitoring and E2E service assurance in 4G wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On QoE monitoring and E2E service assurance in 4G wireless networks","sourcePdf":"017RENGARAJULAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032822S","chronDate":"August  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6272411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6272411","articleId":"6272428","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6272472,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Lightweight framework aspires for minimum possible overhead and optimal possible resources utilization on SMDs. Traditionally the distributed platform is established at runtime by outsourcing intensive applications partially or entirely to cloud datacenters. Such approaches implant intensive responsibilities of distributed platform establishment and management on SMDs for the entire duration of remote application processing. For that reason computing resources of SMDs are exploited copiously. In this paper we investigate the heavyweight aspects of current offloading algorithms in two different scenarios. First, we analyze the impact of VM deployment for application offloading in simulation environment using CloudSim. Second, we investigate the heavyweight aspects of current offloading algorithms by qualitative analysis.

In this paper, a new dynamic spectrum allocation scheme for femtocell networks in OFDM scenario based on reinforcement learning is presented. The proposed algorithm allocates spectrum through Q-Learning to dynamically adjust the number of subchannels by different frequency reuse factors. The greater the reuse factor is, the fewer the shared subchannels in adjacent femtocells are. The reward function of Q-Learning considers spectral efficiency of all femtocells to ensure the minimum spectral efficiency of each cell as much as possible.

Performance comparison in terms of the capacity of the quantized beamforming MIMO systems based on the four different codebooks are given by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272722","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261593/6272714/06272722.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of codebooks for beamforming in limited feedback MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272722/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of codebooks for beamforming in limited feedback MIMO systems","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13064499","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6272722/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of codebooks for beamforming in limited feedback MIMO systems","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"2000812525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110485S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261593","isNumber":"6272714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261593","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6272714","articleId":"6272722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6272753,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Sui","affiliation":["Wireless and Mobile Communications Research and Development center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Sui","id":"38468706600"},{"name":"Yunzhou Li","affiliation":["Wireless and Mobile Communications Research and Development center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunzhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37292404300"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Wireless and Mobile Communications Research and Development center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["HPC Developer Technology group, NVIDIA, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468574500"},{"name":"Bin Zhou","affiliation":["HPC Developer Technology group, NVIDIA, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37064861500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0088-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0087-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6272753","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Detectors","MIMO","Kernel","Throughput","Wireless communication","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","computational complexity","graphics processing units","matrix inversion","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multiprocessing systems","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high throughput MIMO-OFDM detection","graphics processing units","GPU","general purpose processors","GPP","software defined radio","vector-based data-intensive highly parallel computation","SDR platform","multiple-input multiple-output detection","computational complexity","minimum mean square error-based detector","MMSE-based detector","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication systems","MIMO wireless communication systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","massively parallel implementation","scalable matrix inversion","optimization methods","on-chip memories","overlap kernel execution","data transfer","CPU","GPU","flexible MMSE detector","64QAM","4th generation wireless communication standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","MIMO-OFDM","MMSE","matrix inversion"]}],"abstract":"Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been one of the most important General Purpose Processors (GPPs) for Software Defined Radio (SDR), since they are specialized for vector-based data-intensive highly parallel computation. Among the main modules of SDR platform, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection is most time-consuming and computational complexity. A novel strategy is proposed to implement the minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based detector for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). The key component of the strategy is a massively parallel implementation of the scalable matrix inversion, which is the performance bottleneck in the MMSE detector, on graphics processing units (GPUs). A series of optimization methods such as multi-threaded matrix inversion with multiple data frames, maximizing the utilization of the fast on-chip memories, and overlap kernel execution with data transfer between CPU and GPU, are proposed to construct a reconfigurable and flexible MMSE detector.

Compressive sensing can capture and represent compressible signal at a rate below the Nyquist rate, and it is possible to reconstruct signals accurately and sometimes even exactly from far fewer data than what is usually considered necessary via using an optimization process which is broadly applied in compressive imaging. GA is global numerical-optimization method which works well in the problem of optimization. Therefore, the new method proposed in this paper combines advantages of compressive sensing and GA which can adaptively look for optimal solution to ensure the best recovery performance.

The goal of the NIALM system is to identify and track instances when appliance in a building is turned on and off. This is achieved by collecting electric power data measure live from the service entry point of a building; disaggregate it and extracting unique features of the signal that can be used to identify appliances in the building. The NIALM provides a relatively cheap and efficient way to monitor appliances without invading the home or disrupting the normal configuration of the household appliances. To better plan for our current and future energy needs, it is important for us to know how each of our electrical appliance is been utilized. This information would help facility managers to better manage and distribute power; appliance producer to design and produce more energy efficient appliances; and also home owners/building managers understand each appliance, utilization and energy consumption which would help in decision making.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272871/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13064646","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6272871/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electric load monitoring of residential buildings using goodness of fit and multi-layer perceptron neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric load monitoring of residential buildings using goodness of fit and multi-layer perceptron neural networks","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"2015712847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084116S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261593","isNumber":"6272714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261593","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6272714","articleId":"6272871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6272884,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Jin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Jin","id":"38468598300"},{"name":"Zengyuan Mi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Zengyuan","lastName":"Mi","id":"38469060100"},{"name":"Xiaotian Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaotian","lastName":"Wu","id":"38468853400"},{"name":"Yue Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Huang","id":"38468480600"},{"name":"Xinghao Ding","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xinghao","lastName":"Ding","id":"37979781200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0088-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0087-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6272884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":678},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Image restoration","Filtering algorithms","Filtering","Image edge detection","Real time systems","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","geophysical image processing","image restoration","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single image dehazing","dark channel estimation method","image quality","weather conditions","single image haze removal","anisotropic local mean","fast bilateral filter","linear function","image size","real-time visibility restoration","halo reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["de-haze","fog","dark channel prior","image restoration","bilateral filter"]}],"abstract":"The image quality is effected dramatically by the weather conditions such as haze, fog and smoke. In surveillance or vehicle systems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to remove haze from a single image. A new dark channel estimation method is employed by subtracting three times variance from mean to approximate the minimum value, which is defined as the dark channel in a local area. To achieve anisotropic local mean and variance, a fast bilateral filter is introduced. Its complexity is a linear function of the size of the image, which makes real-time visibility restoration possible. Compared with existing algorithm based on dark channel prior, the proposed algorithm have better performance by reducing the halos introduced by large patches very well with less computational cost.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272714","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261593/6272714/06272884.pdf","endPage":"795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single image de-haze based on a new dark channel estimation method","doi":"10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272884","startPage":"791","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Single image de-haze based on a new dark channel estimation method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6272884/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","accessionNumber":"13064658","publicationDate":"May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6272884/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single image de-haze based on a new dark channel estimation method","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"2017012876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049477S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261593","isNumber":"6272714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261593","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6272714","articleId":"6272884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6272961,"authors":[{"name":"Maosong Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Science, PLA University of science and technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Maosong","lastName":"Huang","id":"38468956600"},{"name":"Yan Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of science and technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Guo","id":"37557206100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0088-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0087-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6272961","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Wireless sensor networks","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path loss exponent","localization algorithm","cognitive radio networks","position information","primary user","secondary user","harmful interference","received signal strength"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["path loss component","Weighted least square","Cognitive Radio Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6272961","doi":"10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272961","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, acquirement of the position information of primary user (PU) is of vital of importance to the communication of the secondary users(SU), as it can be used to avoid harmful interference to the network while simultaneity be exploited to improve the spectrum utilization.

Based on the imperfect CSI, the probability density function of the effective signal to noise ratio (SNR) is derived, and the fading gain switching thresholds subject to a target packet loss rate and fixed power constraint are also derived. According to these results, closed-form expressions of the average spectrum efficiency (SE) and packet error rate (PER) of the system are further derived, respectively. These derived expressions include some existing expressions with perfect CSI as special cases, and can provide good performance evaluation for the CLD system with imperfect CSI. Numerical results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis. The results show that the SE and PER of the system with imperfect CSI are worse than those with perfect CSI due to the estimation error, but their performance difference will be reduced as estimation accuracy increases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer design for space-time block coded MIMO systems with imperfect channel state information","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","doi":"10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273009","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261593/6272893/06273009.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6273009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6273009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer design for space-time block coded MIMO systems with imperfect channel state information","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6273009/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12947245","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer design for space-time block coded MIMO systems with imperfect channel state information","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"3011613147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07364S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261593","isNumber":"6272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261593","xplore-issue":"6272893","articleId":"6273009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6273020,"authors":[{"name":"Pin Liao","affiliation":["College of Science and Technology, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Pin","lastName":"Liao","id":"38466375900"},{"name":"Yongjun Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Yongjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38468602100"},{"name":"Mingyan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406962100"},{"name":"Siru Ding","affiliation":["Research Institute 704, Academy of AeroSpace Electronics Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siru","lastName":"Ding","id":"38466592600"},{"name":"Huimin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37403466100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0088-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0087-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6273020","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Lighting","Face","Histograms","Training","Probes","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Gabor filters","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preprocessing scheme","local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence","automated face recognition system","gallery image","probe image","illumination change","facial expression","intrapersonal variation","facial image","LGBPHS","gamma correction transformation","local normalization procedure","FERET face database","recognition performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recogntion","preprocessing scheme","Gamma correction","local normization","local Gabor binary pattern historgram sequence"]}],"abstract":"To a great extent, the performance and robustness of automated face recognition systems are impacted by within-class variations between gallery and probe images acquired in a variety of conditions.

Firstly, an effective preprocessing scheme is employed incorporating a Logarithmic transformation and a local normalization procedure. Then the local block Gabor features are extracted by applying Gab or filters to each spatial block of preprocessed facial images. After that, multiple F-LDA classifiers are obtained on each local block of Gabor features. Finally, all the classifiers are fused to an ensemble classifier.

The BP method estimates the motion possibility by considering the spatial and temporal interaction of pixels of the moving objects, and therefore has the high detect correctness. In addition this method is applicable to the environment with the changing background due to the movement of the camera. Clausius Entropy method, recently proposed, is one for detecting the objects by the entropy difference by transforming the image region to entropy region and is stable against the noise. In this work, we successfully detect all the moving objects from the small objects to the disguised objects by applying the 3D MRF model in entropy region by coupling these two methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Solid modeling","Noise","Image color analysis","Hidden Markov models","Mathematical model","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief maintenance","cameras","entropy","image motion analysis","Markov processes","object detection","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving object detection","Clausius entropy model","3D MRF model","pixel-level change","belief propagation method","BP method","3D Markov random field model","motion possibility","spatial interaction","temporal interaction","detect correctness","camera","entropy difference","image region","entropy region"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["moving object detection","Hidden Markov Model","Entropy","MMSE","Belief Propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273045","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261593/6272893/06273045.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on a method for detecting the moving objects by coupling the Clausius Entropy model and the 3D MRF model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6273045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study on a method for detecting the moving objects by coupling the Clausius Entropy model and the 3D MRF model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6273045/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6273045/","accessionNumber":"12947281","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on a method for detecting the moving objects by coupling the Clausius Entropy model and the 3D MRF model","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"3015213235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046812S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261593","isNumber":"6272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261593","xplore-issue":"6272893","articleId":"6273045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6273050,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaqing Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jiaqing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37715142500"},{"name":"Qi Lv","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Lv","id":"37721167400"},{"name":"Yong Dou","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Dou","id":"37285984800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0088-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0087-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6273050","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","fault diagnosis","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicellular array architecture","activator-inhibitor model theory","active cell ranking","passive cell sequence number maintaining method","ordinary distributed ranking method","active sequence maintain mechanism","single-point-of-failure properties","fault-injection experiment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed ranking","multicellular array architecture","pattern formation theory","activator-inhibitor model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6273050","abstract":"This paper presents a novel distributed ranking method based on activator-inhibitor model theory for multicellular array architecture. Cell ranking in multicellular array means that sequence number 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, n have to be assigned to the different cells. This method has two characteristics: 1) it's an active cell ranking and sequence number maintaining method compared to existing passive cell sequence number maintaining methods in multicellular array architectures; 2) it doesn't need initial value to rank and maintain cell sequence numbers, which is different from ordinary distributed ranking methods based on initial values. This method imitates the active sequence maintain mechanism in organisms to eliminate the single-point-of-failure properties of existing cell sequence number maintaining methods. Fault-injection experiments show our method has better robustness than existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273050","startPage":"719","endPage":"724","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSAE.2012.6273050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6272893","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Engineering (CSAE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261593/6272893/06273050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel distributed ranking method based on activator-inhibitor model for multicellular array architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6273050/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel distributed ranking method based on activator-inhibitor model for multicellular array architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6273050/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12947286","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel distributed ranking method based on activator-inhibitor model for multicellular array architecture","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"3015713245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050714S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261593","isNumber":"6272893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261593","xplore-issue":"6272893","articleId":"6273050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6273051,"authors":[{"name":"Weining Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Weining","lastName":"Wu","id":"37899695500"},{"name":"Maozu Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Maozu","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274181100"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279415400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0089-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0088-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0087-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6273051","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"We present a method of active learning with optimal sampling strategy.

A reliable strategy for the detection of unused spectrum bands is essential in a practical implementation of CR systems. It is widely accepted that in a real-world environment, cooperative spectrum sensing involving many secondary users (SUs) scattered over a wide geographical area can greatly improve sensing accuracy. However, some SUs may misbehave, i.e. provide false sensing information, in an attempt to maximize their own utility gains. Such selfish behaviour, if unchecked, can severely impact the operation of the CR system. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-aware resource allocation scheme in a centralized cognitive radio network with a system-level trust model in which trustworthiness is used as social capital to gain system resources. The scheme can detect misbehaving SUs and filter out the malicious attacks while attempting to maximize the total bit rate of SUs.

Muscle forces estimation is important for orthopedists, bio-mechanists, and physical therapists because of joint contact forces. In this work, EMG signal is used to estimate human arm muscle force by implementing a new Back-Propagation neural network (BPNN) model. The proposed model, uses the rectified smoothed electromyography (RSEMG) signals as input to generate the estimated muscle force as an output. To train the system, the Biceps-brachii muscle force was used. To validate our model, the Brachioradialis, Triceps-brachii, and Flexor carpi ulnaris muscles' signals were used. To measure the performance of the model, the BPNN output estimated force is compared with the Hill-Type force estimation. Our results illustrate that. The output of our model is accurate compared with Hell-type model. This can be proved through the regression value of our model which exceeded 99%. We have used four muscles of the arm to show that our model can estimate the force of any muscle of the hand, which makes it a global hand muscle force estimator.","doi":"10.1109/VECIMS.2012.6273225","startPage":"222","endPage":"227","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Virtual Environments Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurement Systems (VECIMS) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261594/6273175/06273225.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Virtual Environments Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurement Systems (VECIMS) Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VECIMS.2012.6273225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6273175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMG-muscle force estimation model based on back-propagation neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Muscles","Force","Mathematical model","Electromyography","Estimation","Joints","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biomechanics","electromyography","medical signal processing","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMG-muscle force estimation model","backpropagation neural network","muscle functions","mscle forces estimation","human arm muscle force","rectified smoothed electromyography signals","EMG signal","biceps-brachii muscle force","brachioradialis","flexor carpi ulnaris muscles","Hill-type force estimation","regression value","global hand muscle force estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMG signal","Hill-type model","Back-Propagation neural network (BPNN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6273225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"EMG-muscle force estimation model based on back-propagation neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6273225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12947408","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMG-muscle force estimation model based on back-propagation neural network","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"1569584815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061189S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261594","isNumber":"6273175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261594","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6273175","articleId":"6273225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6273254,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Luan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Xin Luan","id":"37999804900"},{"name":"Fangjie Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Fangjie Yu","id":"38466920300"},{"name":"Honghong Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Honghong Zhou","id":"38466837700"},{"name":"Xiufang Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Xiufang Li","id":"38466877800"},{"name":"Dalei Song","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Dalei Song","id":"38003717800"},{"name":"Bingwei Wu","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Bingwei Wu","id":"38469053800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1604-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1601-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1603-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6273254","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6273254","abstract":"This paper presents a novel area-based stereo matching algorithm based on improved census transform under changing illumination. For the traditional census-based stereo matching, the result is not robust under variant illumination, because the intensity value of center pixel in the mask is affected by the noise to cause distortion. In order to solve this problem, we propose the improved census transform method, which takes the standard deviation of census mask as the base point instead of the center pixel, comparing with the difference of per neighborhood pixel and the mean intensity of the mask to build the sparse census transform.

To further reduce the quantity of the acquired data for frequency-sparse signals, this paper presents a new data acquisition and compression method combining time-interleaved sampling technique with Compressed Sampling (CS) theory. We implement synchronous data compression using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, in which the asynchronous data streams are first synchronized through multistage buffering method and then compressed by CS approach. An important strength of this method lies in that the entire design is synchronized by a common clock, which allows the circuit to work at a high rate. From the perspective of data stream, we obtain a compressed data steam at a sub-Nyquist rate which reduces the load of storage and transmission significantly. The simulation experiments verify that the original signal can be recovered exactly from the compressed data with overwhelming probability.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012

This paper first introduces and analyzes the basic principle of acoustic source localization using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements. Time difference measurement is a key problem in TDOA location method for its accuracy directly determines the position estimation accuracy of the location system. Generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method can weaken the impact of noise on the delay estimation accuracy so this method is adopted in the paper to obtain TDOA measurement by detecting the peak position of the correlation function of two signals. Through the analysis of TDOA location algorithm, an improved Taylor algorithm with 10 iterations is proposed to solve the location coordinate of the acoustic source. This algorithm can achieve a higher accuracy with relatively smaller calculation. In order to forecast system performance, MATLAB simulations are realized for an acoustic source localization system using microphone array. Finally, the implementation of location system and actual test results are presented. In the actual environment, positioning errors are within 3 cm with microphone array element spacing of 50 cm and it is shown the implemented system can be applied to acoustic source localization.","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2012.6273317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6273239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2012.6273317","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261643/6273239/06273317.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on acoustic source localization using time difference of arrival measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Research on acoustic source localization using time difference of arrival measurements","isConference":true,"volume":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6273317/","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13064740","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6273317/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on acoustic source localization using time difference of arrival measurements","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"021196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070593S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261643","isNumber":"6273239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261643","xplore-issue":"6273239","articleId":"6273317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6273333,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Chao Zuo","id":"37087313188"},{"name":"Xiaofei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xiaofei Yang","id":"37087766083"},{"name":"Jun Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jun Ouyang","id":"37087722999"},{"name":"Weiwei Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Weiwei Han","id":"37087306871"},{"name":"Shi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Shi Chen","id":"37087766144"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1604-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1601-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1603-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6273333","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic field measurement","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","calibration","electromagnetic interference","geomagnetism","geophysics computing","magnetic field measurement","magnetometers","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geomagnetic measurement calibration algorithm","neural networks","geomagnetic field","geomagnetism navigation","geomagnetism observation","magnetometer measurements","environmental magnetic field","carrier magnetic field","calibration method","magnetic disturbance","high-precision measurements","in-depth analysis","magnetic interference","BP neural network algorithm","dynamic characteristics","mapping relationship","input-output function","adaptive ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["geomagnetic measurements","magnetic disturbance","BP neural network","calibration algorithm"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel geomagnetic measurement calibration algorithm based on neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6273333","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2012.6273333","startPage":"290","endPage":"293","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Measurement, Information and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6261643/6273239/06273333.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2012.6273333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6273239","abstract":"The studying of the geomagnetic field is a fundamental task in geomagnetism navigation and observation.

Recently, many robust approaches to overcome the above problems are studied, such as Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV), Diagonal Loading (DL) and so on. Among them, Norm Constraint Capon Beamforming (NCCB) is most popular and has a clear physical meaning. In this paper, we transform the original formulation of NCCB into Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) form, and give a complete performance analysis of NCCB approach. Simulation results show that NCCB is more robust against the steering vector errors, and has a better power estimation of the Signal of Interest (SOI) and output Signal Interference Noise Ratio (SINR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6273467/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"12947602","publicationDate":"May 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6273467/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of Norm Constrained Capon Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of Norm Constrained Capon Beamforming","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"041367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052513S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6261643","isNumber":"6273366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6261643","xplore-issue":"6273366","articleId":"6273467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6273552,"authors":[{"name":"Jinmei Liu","affiliation":["Air Force Logistics College, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jinmei","lastName":"Liu","id":"38468664200"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Air Force Logistics College, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"38469073100"},{"name":"Honggang Liu","affiliation":["Air Force Logistics College, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38468722100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2401-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2400-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2399-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6273552","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Safety","Atmospheric modeling","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","logistics","military aircraft","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum solution","aviation ammunition transport problem","genetic algorithm","mathematical model","transport ability","best transportation projects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aviation ammunition","linear programming","genetic algorithm","transport model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6273552","abstract":"Establishing an aviation ammunition transport model is an important premise to conduct quantitative study to the problems in aviation ammunition transport.

We study the overall round trip time from the start of the request to the response returning to the client. Furthermore, we measure and analyse the phases the request travels through to the server and the return of an associated response. The results of the overall round trip time and distribution of the delays along the service invocation path is presented to ultimately aid and justify a selection of the better performing interface implementation and associated message encoding scheme for the solution. Both interfaces implement the same functionality of registering a client, sending and receiving a message and finally unregistering.

In this paper summarize, classify and evaluate current approaches respect to determine costs of virtual machine live migration.","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2012.23","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Eighth World Congress on Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Eighth World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6273233/6274002/06274069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2012.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6274002","startPage":"323","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Costs of Virtual Machine Live Migration: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Costs of Virtual Machine Live Migration: A Survey","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274069/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12947360","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6274069/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Costs of Virtual Machine Live Migration: A Survey","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4756a323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08635S","chronDate":"24-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273233","isNumber":"6274002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273233","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6274002","articleId":"6274069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6274140,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lo","id":"37085505227"},{"name":"Jianwei Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Yin","id":"37333523200"},{"name":"Shuiguang Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shuiguang","lastName":"Deng","id":"37277817500"},{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37279889600"},{"name":"Zhaohui Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278598300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3049-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4753-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274140","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":616},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Web services","Time factors","Sparse matrices","Accuracy","Prediction algorithms","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","matrix decomposition","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended matrix factorization","Web services","World Wide Web","QoS-based service selection","history records","EMF framework","relational regularization","missing QoS values prediction","user side similarity measurements","service side similarity measurements","unified MF framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Service","QoS Prediction","Matrix Factorization","Regularization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274140","abstract":"With the growing adoption of Web services on the World Wide Web, the issue of QoS-based service selection is becoming important. A common hypothesis of previous research is that the QoS information to the current user is supposed all known and accurate. However, the real case is that there are many missing QoS values in history records. To avoid the expensive and costly Web services invocations, this paper proposes an extended Matrix Factorization (EMF) framework with relational regularization to make missing QoS values prediction. We first elaborate the Matrix Factorization (MF) model from a general perspective. To collect the wisdom of crowds precisely, we employ different similarity measurements on user side and service side to identify neighborhood. And then we systematically design two novel relational regularization terms inside a neighborhood. Finally we combine both terms into a unified MF framework to predict the missing QoS values. To validate our methods, experiments on real Web services data are conducted. The empirical analysis shows that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods in QoS prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2012.36","startPage":"162","endPage":"169","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Services Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2012.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6274119","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6273231/6274119/06274140.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Extended Matrix Factorization Approach for QoS Prediction in Service Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274140/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Extended Matrix Factorization Approach for QoS Prediction in Service Selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274140/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12948903","publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 June 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extended Matrix Factorization Approach for QoS Prediction in Service Selection","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4753a162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058271S","chronDate":"24-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273231","isNumber":"6274119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273231","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6274119","articleId":"6274140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6274197,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Fang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Fang","id":"38468653100"},{"name":"ZhiHui Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"ZhiHui","lastName":"Lu","id":"38468613000"},{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wu","id":"38468861400"},{"name":"ZhenYin Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"ZhenYin","lastName":"Cao","id":"38469035700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3049-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4753-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274197","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1080},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Load modeling","Servers","Cloud computing","Data models","Prediction algorithms","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","resource allocation","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource prediction and provisioning scheme","cloud data center","virtualization","elastic fine-grained resource provision","SLA","RPPS","VM-complementary migration strategy","demand fluctuations","CPU intensive applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prediction","provisioning","migration","cloud","data center"]}],"abstract":"Cloud data centers and virtualization are being highly considered for enterprises and industries. However, elastic fine-grained resource provision while ensuring performance and SLA guarantees for applications requires careful consideration of important and extremely challenging tradeoffs. In this paper, we present RPPS (Cloud Resource Prediction and Provisioning scheme), a scheme that automatically predict future demand and perform proactive resource provisioning for cloud applications. RPPS employs the ARIMA model to predict the workloads in the future, combines both coarse-grained and fine-grained resource scaling under different situations, and adopts a VM-complementary migration strategy. RPPS can resolve predictive resource provisioning problem when enterprises confront demand fluctuations in cloud data center. We evaluate a prototype of RPPS with traces collected by ourselves using typical CPU intensive applications and as well as workloads from a real data center. The results show that it not only has high prediction accuracy (about 90% match in most time) but also scales the resource well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RPPS: A Novel Resource Prediction and Provisioning Scheme in Cloud Data Center","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2012.47","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6273231/6274119/06274197.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2012.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6274119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"RPPS: A Novel Resource Prediction and Provisioning Scheme in Cloud Data Center","conferenceDate":"24-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274197/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948947","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RPPS: A Novel Resource Prediction and Provisioning Scheme in Cloud Data Center","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"4753a609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074144S","chronDate":"24-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273231","isNumber":"6274119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273231","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6274119","articleId":"6274197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6274229,"authors":[{"name":"V.A.

Generally, a camera functions for video recording and lacks the ability to detect whether tampering has occurred. Most tampering solutions are passive, as evidenced by many surveillance systems frequently left unattended. Tampering detection of real-time automated cameras is thus of priority concern important for timely operator warning. This work describes a novel algorithm for camera tamper detection scheme. Developed for video surveillance and security applications, the pro-posed approach identifies camera tampering by detecting large edge differences and grayscale histogram comparisons between current and previous frames. The optimized algorithm is implemented on PC and TI DAVINCI DM6437 DSP as well. Extensive experiments were performed.

has more effect on human societies than the others. Scentific researches have important roles in drought planning and management of water resources, especially in time of crisis and predicted big event by the event that the crisis management turnover. The main objective of this research is to develop an approach to analyze the spatial patterns of meteorological droughts based on annual precipitation data in Iran. By using a nonparametric spatial analysis neural network algorithm, the normalized and standardized precipitation data are classified into certain degrees of drought severity (extreme drought, severe drought, mild drought, and nondrought) based on a number of truncation levels corresponding to specified quantiles of the standard normal distribution. Then posterior probabilities of drought severity at any given point in the region are determined and the point is assigned a Bayesian Drought Severity Index. This index may be useful for constructing drought severity maps in Iran that display the spatial variability of drought severity for the whole region on a yearly basis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6274307/","accessionNumber":"12959667","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Artificial Neural Network (SANN) Based Regional Drought Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Artificial Neural Network (SANN) Based Regional Drought Analysis","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4821a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095457S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273236","isNumber":"6274306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273236","xplore-issue":"6274306","articleId":"6274307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6274311,"authors":[{"name":"Kullawat Chaowanawatee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kullawat","lastName":"Chaowanawatee","id":"38468595000"},{"name":"Apichat Heednacram","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand"],"firstName":"Apichat","lastName":"Heednacram","id":"38468761700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2640-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4821-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274311","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Training","Forecasting","Optimization","Rivers","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","floods","forecasting theory","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","radial basis function networks","rivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural network","decision making","flood water level forecasting","neural network training","cuckoo search algorithm","Little Wabash River","radial basis function","polyharmonic function","Gaussian function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computational intelligence","neural network","cuckoo search","flood forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274311","abstract":"The flood forecasting is the key to support the right decision making. A method to forecast flood accurately and timely are important. We propose a method based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network which has the important application in flood water level forecasting. The traditional way of training of the neural network may drive the network to converge in local minima instead of global minimum. We introduce a cuckoo search algorithm to train parameters of neural network instead of a normal way. We implement our proposed algorithm where the input is the real data from Little Wabash River. In the experimental part, we choose the type of Radial Basis Function to be Gaussian and Polyharmonic. We investigate the impact of these two RBF functions and discuss the error between the forecast and the actual values. We conclude that Polyharmonic function suits to this problem better than Gaussian function.","doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2012.15","startPage":"22","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2012.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6274306","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6273236/6274306/06274311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Cuckoo Search in RBF Neural Network for Flood Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274311/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Cuckoo Search in RBF Neural Network for Flood Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274311/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12948970","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Cuckoo Search in RBF Neural Network for Flood Forecasting","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4821a022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035049S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273236","isNumber":"6274306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273236","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6274306","articleId":"6274311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6274313,"authors":[{"name":"Min Keng Tan","affiliation":["Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Minerals & Materials Research Unit, School of Engineering and Information Technology Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min Keng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37853110000"},{"name":"Helen Sin Ee Chuo","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Helen Sin Ee","lastName":"Chuo","id":"38667323500"},{"name":"Heng Jin Tham","affiliation":["Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Minerals & Materials Research Unit, School of Engineering and Information Technology Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Heng Jin","lastName":"Tham","id":"37847565700"},{"name":"Yan Yan Farm","affiliation":["Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory, Minerals & Materials Research Unit, School of Engineering and Information Technology Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yan Yan","lastName":"Farm","id":"37086763980"},{"name":"Kenneth Tze Kin Teo","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Kenneth Tze Kin","lastName":"Teo","id":"37404084600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2640-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4821-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274313","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274313","abstract":"Exothermic process is highly nonlinear and complex process. Large amount of heat will be released during the chemical reaction. As a result of the exothermic behaviour, the reaction may become unstable and consequently poses safety concern to the plant if the reactor temperature exceeds the cooling capacity. In the industrial point of view, heating is needed in order to speed up the reaction rate so that it can reduce the overall process reaction time. Hence, this paper proposes genetic algorithm (GA) to control the reaction temperature as well as to balance the production needs with the safety specification. GA exploits probabilistic search method to optimise the specific objective function based on evolutionary principle. Simulation assessment of the GA has been carried out using a benchmark exothermic batch process model.

Heads Distribution of Wireless Sensor Networks via Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks consists of hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes supported by small capacity battery. For environmental monitoring purposes, sensor nodes must have high endurance capabilities. Therefore, selecting suitable cluster heads (CH) location becomes a challenging issue. In this work, cluster heads distribution based on adaptive particle swarm (PSO) is proposed. PSO is one of the swarm intelligence methods designed to find optimum solution by mimicking the behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. Adaptive cognitive and social learning factor can achieve better convergence speed and particles reselection mechanism can reduce the chances of getting trapped in local maximum. The performance of the proposed method is compared with low energy adaptive cluster hierarchical (LEACH). Simulation result shows that proposed method outperforms LEACH in terms of first node die (FND) round, total data received by base station and energy consume per round.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274321/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12948980","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274321/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cluster Heads Distribution of Wireless Sensor Networks via Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster Heads Distribution of Wireless Sensor Networks via Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4821a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074215S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273236","isNumber":"6274306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273236","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6274306","articleId":"6274321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6274322,"authors":[{"name":"Chen How Wong","affiliation":["Minerals & Materials Research Unit, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chen How","lastName":"Wong","id":"37086656518"},{"name":"Zhan Wei Siew","affiliation":["Minerals & Materials Research Unit, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zhan Wei","lastName":"Siew","id":"38233722300"},{"name":"Min Keng Tan","affiliation":["Minerals & Materials Research Unit, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min Keng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37853110000"},{"name":"Renee Ka Yin Chin","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Renee Ka Yin","lastName":"Chin"},{"name":"Kenneth Tze Kin Teo","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Kenneth Tze Kin","lastName":"Teo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2640-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4821-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274322","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Genetic algorithms","Array signal processing","Wireless sensor networks","Biological cells","Optimization","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","genetic algorithms","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed optimization","collaborative beamforming","wireless sensor network","WSN","transmission distance","energy efficiency","sensor assignment","array pattern synthesis","node selection method","uniform space linear array synthesis","virtual line construction","network topology","nodes selection optimization","genetic algorithm","radiation beam pattern improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","wireless sensor networks","collaborate beamforming","genetic algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Collaborate beamforming in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a concept of using beamforming technology to establish link in the networks.

Project managers have to manage different software development processes based on different time, cost, and number of staff, sequentially. Software time, cost, and number of staff estimates are the critical tasks for project managers in software companies. Estimation of these parameters at early stage of software project planning is one the challenging issued in software project management, for the last decade. Software cost and time estimation supports the project planning and tracking, and it controls the expenses of software development. Software effort estimation refers to the estimates of the likely amount of cost, schedule, and manpower required to develop a software. Accurate effort estimate at the early phase of software development can help project managers to efficiently control project progress and improve the project success rate. This paper proposes a novel artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model incorporates Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO), ANN-COCOMO II, to provide more accurate software estimates at the early phase of software development. This model uses the advantages of artificial neural networks such as learning ability and good interpretability, while maintaining the merits of the COCOMO model. The ANN is utilised to calibrate the software attributes using past project data, in order to produce accurate software estimates. The proposed model is evaluated using 156 sets of project data from two data sets, COCOMO I and NASA93. The analysis of the obtained results shows 8.36% improvement in estimation accuracy in the ANN-COCOMO II model, when compared with the original COCOMO II.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274335/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12948993","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274335/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Proposing an Enhanced Artificial Neural Network Prediction Model to Improve the Accuracy in Software Effort Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposing an Enhanced Artificial Neural Network Prediction Model to Improve the Accuracy in Software Effort Estimation","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4821a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056025S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273236","isNumber":"6274306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273236","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6274306","articleId":"6274335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6274341,"authors":[{"name":"Akhil Behl","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence for Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics and Photonics, UNSW, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Akhil","lastName":"Behl","id":"38235090700"},{"name":"Kanika Behl","affiliation":["IT, Jagan Institute of Management Studies, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Kanika","lastName":"Behl","id":"38468698000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2640-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4821-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274341","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1588},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Organizations","Standards organizations","Authorization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud security paradigms","cloud computing","catchphrase","Internet","services-based environment","cost-effective solutions","computing needs","computing infrastructure","cloud-aware security solutions","dynamic cloud environment","cloud providers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud","security","Cloud Computing","Security Challenges","distributed computing","Security Paradigm"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing -- some treat it as a catchphrase, others as the next step in evolution of their organization and the Internet. However, what is for sure is that, it is a way of leveraging less expensive services based environment providing cost-effective solutions to various organizations to cater for their computing needs, without investing in computing infrastructure. However, cloud computing, just like other formats of computing, is not free from issues. One of the major barriers in adoption of cloud is security. Once migrated to cloud, you do not know where your data is physically stored, what laws and regulations govern the same and most important of all, who has access to it. This paper explores security issues related to cloud computing and proposes a paradigm for securing cloud. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud environment, followed by conclusion where we try to entail the whole research and try to formulate a practical security paradigm, which will enable the cloud providers and consumers to ensure that their data and valuable assets are safe from otherwise prying eyes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Paradigms for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2012.45","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6273236/6274306/06274341.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2012.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6274306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Security Paradigms for Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274341/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948996","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Paradigms for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4821a200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092754S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273236","isNumber":"6274306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273236","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6274306","articleId":"6274341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6274357,"authors":[{"name":"Akram Azarloo","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Akram","lastName":"Azarloo","id":"38469103500"},{"name":"Fardad Farokhi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fardad","lastName":"Farokhi","id":"37596620500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2640-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4821-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274357","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Feature extraction","Support vector machine classification","Classification algorithms","Accuracy","Training","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","multilayer perceptrons","musical instruments","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic musical instrument recognition","MLP neural networks","musical instrument automatic recognition","audio signal classification","K-NN algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Musical Instrument Recognition","Feature Extraction","Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)","K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)","UTA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274357","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed an approach to Musical Instrument Automatic Recognition.

and forwards the packet in a single transmission time slot. At the same time, network coding increases the complexity of packets management and delay of network due to the waiting time for network coding opportunity. A solution based on improved genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the network coding node resources in network coding. Genetic algorithm will search a multicast tree that fulfils the desired throughput with a desired multicast rate. Mutation rate of the genetic algorithm will change based on the previous solution to avoid from being stuck on the local optima. The simulation result shows that with given multicast rate, improved genetic algorithm is able to search and construct multicast tree with minimal usage of network coding nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274375/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12949029","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274375/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Network Coding Nodes in Multicast Tree Construction via Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Network Coding Nodes in Multicast Tree Construction via Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"4821a399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068757S","chronDate":"24-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273236","isNumber":"6274306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273236","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6274306","articleId":"6274375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6274638,"authors":[{"name":"Kual-Zheng Lee","affiliation":["Information & Communications Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kual-Zheng","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086682853"},{"name":"Luo-Wei Tsai","affiliation":["Information & Communications Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Luo-Wei","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37548380200"},{"name":"Pang-Chan Hung","affiliation":["Information & Communications Research Lab., Industrial Technology Research Institute, HsinChu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pang-Chan","lastName":"Hung","id":"37086682704"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1741-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4712-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274638","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Accuracy","Tracking","Cameras","Conferences","Monitoring","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","embedded systems","feature extraction","image motion analysis","image sequences","object tracking","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled motion statistics","fast people counting method","tracking methods","moving target monitoring","motion information analysis","region of interest","bidirectional people counting","sampled image area","predefined object size","prior calibration phase","motion features","directional status","image sequences","spatial-temporal analysis","complex object labeling","complex object tracking","outdoor environments","embedded systems","rapid processing frame rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["People counting","Surveillance system","Motion feature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274638","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a fast people counting method using the sampled motion statistics.

Combining the motion features and its directional status in image sequences, people counts can be estimated through spatial-temporal analysis.

The PBMA successively recovers the corrupted MB with minimizing the impact of corrupted-residual by ED information. At packet error rate of 20%, this work outperforms sophisticated EC algorithms by 0.13dB at least on average PSNR, as indicated from experiment result.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Error Concealment Using Progressive Block Matching Algorithm with Euclidean Distance","publicationTitle":"2012 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2012.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6273237/6274114/06274647.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2012.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6274114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6274647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Video Error Concealment Using Progressive Block Matching Algorithm with Euclidean Distance","conferenceDate":"18-20 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6274647/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12949125","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Error Concealment Using Progressive Block Matching Algorithm with Euclidean Distance","confLoc":"Piraeus-Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"4712a199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057223S","chronDate":"18-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6273237","isNumber":"6274114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6273237","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6274114","articleId":"6274647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6274653,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang-Cheh Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Cheh","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275101100"},{"name":"Feng-Cheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Innovative Information and Technology, Tamkang University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Feng-Cheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37415447100"},{"name":"Chun-Hsien Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hsien","lastName":"Wu","id":"38468733500"},{"name":"Wei-Hao Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Hao","lastName":"Lai","id":"38231691700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1741-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4712-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6274653","dbTime":"104 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6274653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Watermarking","Robustness","Image reconstruction","Image quality","PSNR","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","copyright","data compression","data privacy","image reconstruction","image sampling","image watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["watermarking","compressive sampling applications","data compression","innovative scheme","data copyright protection","image reconstruction","secret information","data delivery","lossy channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sampling","watermarking","copyright protection","image quality","robustness"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sampling is a newly developed topic in the field of data compression.

In fact, the next generation wireless technologies have put significant emphasis on supporting distribution of rich media content and video-on-demand services. However, energy consumption in the handheld wireless devices is a major bottleneck that hinders the growth of mobile device based rich media services. The biggest problem today in the mobile world is that the mobile devices are battery driven and the battery technologies are not matching the required energy demand. This paper outlines the major energy-consuming components in handheld devices like smart-phones, PDAs and other multimedia-centric wireless devices. Further, this paper surveys different research works on how the energy consumption could be optimized and provides detailed discussions on the latest energy saving techniques in the major components of the mobile devices. In addition, the paper surveys other systemic energy optimization techniques so that the overall battery life of the device is increased. Major global research projects and their research focus are then surveyed. Finally, a brief summary is provided along with some open research problems and different possible future research directions.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2012.072412.00115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6512259/06275427.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2012.072412.00115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","startPage":"768","endPage":"786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Energy Optimization in Multimedia-Centric Wireless Devices: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Energy Optimization in Multimedia-Centric Wireless Devices: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275427/","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6275427/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2013","accessionNumber":"13475587","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Energy Optimization in Multimedia-Centric Wireless Devices: A Survey","sourcePdf":"11kennedy115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.26548S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6512259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6512259","articleId":"6275427","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275429,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Wen","affiliation":["Center for Military Computational Experiments and Parallel Systems Technology, College of Information System and Management, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ding Wen is a professor at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, Hunan, China, and a senior advisor of the Research Center for Military Computational Experiments and Parallel Systems Technology at NUDT.

We propose a novel computational framework called ACP (Artificial societies, Computational experiments, and Parallel systems), targeting at creating an effective computational theory and developing a systematic methodological framework for socioeconomic studies. The basic idea behind the ACP approach is: 1) to model the complex socioeconomic systems as artificial societies using agent techniques in a \"bottom-up\u201d fashion; 2) to utilize innovative computing technologies and make computers as experimental laboratories for investigating socioeconomic problems; and 3) to achieve an effective management and control of the focal complex socioeconomic system through parallel executions between artificial and actual socioeconomic systems. An ACP-based experimental platform called MacroEconSim has been discussed, which can be used for modeling, analyzing, and experimenting on macroeconomic systems. A case study on economic inflation is also presented to illustrate the key research areas and algorithms integrated in this platform.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2012.24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6522397/06275429.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2012.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6522397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Societies, Computational Experiments, and Parallel Systems: An Investigation on a Computational Theory for Complex Socioeconomic Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Societies, Computational Experiments, and Parallel Systems: An Investigation on a Computational Theory for Complex Socioeconomic Systems","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6275429/","accessionNumber":"13531257","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April-June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Societies, Computational Experiments, and Parallel Systems: An Investigation on a Computational Theory for Complex Socioeconomic Systems","sourcePdf":"tsc2013020177.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100032S","chronDate":"April-June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6522397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6522397","articleId":"6275429","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6275435,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Bogdanov","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Flanders, BE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6585338/6275435/6275435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrey Bogdanov received the PhD degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, in 2009.

Lately, lightweight cryptography--optimizing the algorithms to fit the most constrained environments--has received a great deal of attention, the recent research being mainly focused on building block ciphers. As opposed to that, the design of lightweight hash functions is still far from being well investigated with only few proposals in the public domain. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by exploring the design space of lightweight hash functions based on the sponge construction instantiated with present-type permutations. The resulting family of hash functions is called spongent. We propose 13 spongent variants--or different levels of collision and (second) preimage resistance as well as for various implementation constraints. For each of them, we provide several ASIC hardware implementations--ranging from the lowest area to the highest throughput. We make efforts to address the fairness of comparison with other designs in the field by providing an exhaustive hardware evaluation on various technologies, including an open core library. We also prove essential differential properties of spongent permutations, give a security analysis in terms of collision and preimage resistance, as well as study in detail dedicated linear distinguishers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6585338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6585338/06275435.pdf","startPage":"2041","endPage":"2053","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPONGENT: The Design Space of Lightweight Cryptographic Hashing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"SPONGENT: The Design Space of Lightweight Cryptographic Hashing","volume":"62","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6275435/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13709969","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPONGENT: The Design Space of Lightweight Cryptographic Hashing","sourcePdf":"ttc2013102041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113691S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6585338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6585338","articleId":"6275435","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6275439,"authors":[{"name":"Seetharam Narasimhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6609031/6275439/6275439-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seetharam Narasimhan received the BE (Hons) degree from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2006 and the PhD degree in computer engineering from the Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, in 2012.

Sidechannel analysis has been investigated as an alternative to conventional logic testing to detect the presence of hardware Trojans. However, these techniques suffer from decreased sensitivity toward small Trojans, especially because of the large process variations present in modern nanometer technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel noninvasive, multiple-parameter side-channel analysisbased Trojan detection approach. We use the intrinsic relationship between dynamic current and maximum operating frequency of a circuit to isolate the effect of a Trojan circuit from process noise. We propose a vector generation approach and several design/test techniques to improve the detection sensitivity. Simulation results with two large circuits, a 32-bit integer execution unit (IEU) and a 128-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) cipher, show a detection resolution of 1.12 percent amidst \u00b120 percent parameter variations. The approach is also validated with experimental results. Finally, the use of a combined side-channel analysis and logic testing approach is shown to provide high overall detection coverage for hardware Trojan circuits of varying types and sizes.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6609031/06275439.pdf","startPage":"2183","endPage":"2195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Trojan Detection by Multiple-Parameter Side-Channel Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Trojan Detection by Multiple-Parameter Side-Channel Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275439/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13795182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275439/","volume":"62","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Trojan Detection by Multiple-Parameter Side-Channel Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttc2013112183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17588S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6609031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6609031","articleId":"6275439","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6275443,"authors":[{"name":"Sahin Cem Geyik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6604394/6275443/6275443-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sahin Cem Geyik received the BS degree in computer engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2007.

This data can range from the information on the mobility of the agents that are being monitored by a wireless network to mobility information of nodes in mobile network applications. In this paper, we examine the use of probabilistic context-free grammars as the modeling framework for such data. We present a fast algorithm for deriving a concise probabilistic context-free grammar from the given training data. The algorithm uses an evaluation metric based on Bayesian formula for maximizing grammar a posteriori probability given the training data. We describe the application of this algorithm in two mobility modeling domains: 1) recognizing mobility patterns of monitored agents in different event data sets collected by sensor networks, and 2) modeling and generating node movements in mobile networks. We also discuss the model's performance in simulations utilizing both synthetic and real-world mobility traces.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604394","startPage":"2119","endPage":"2131","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6604394/06275443.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grammatical Inference for Modeling Mobility Patterns in Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6275443/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Grammatical Inference for Modeling Mobility Patterns in Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795119","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grammatical Inference for Modeling Mobility Patterns in Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2013112119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115129S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6604394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6604394","articleId":"6275443","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275451,"authors":[{"name":"Philip A.

Bit-serial architectures have been developed that reduce the number of wires needed, however, they do not fully realize the potential for deeply pipelined serial data processing. Digit- online arithmetic allows operations to be performed in a serial, digit-by-digit manner, making it ideal for use in implementing a digit-serial LDPC decoder. Digit-online circuits for the primitive operations required for an offset min-sum LDPC decoder are simple, and allow deep pipelining at the digit level. A new hardware architecture for LDPC decoding is demonstrated, using redundant number systems for the internal representation of values. We present post-layout decoder results for the (2048, 1723) 10GBASE-T LDPC code in a general-purpose 65 nm CMOS technology. The decoder requires a core area of 10.89 mm and operates at a clock frequency of 980 MHz.

Upon fault occurrence, an auto-triggered silicon control rectifier (SCR) inserts the parallel resonant circuit in the load current path. In addition to self-controlling capability of the proposed SSFCL, it can be controlled using an external command generated by a fault detection algorithm.

It is shown that TCMs can orient the design procedure by providing an insight into the natural behavior of the analyzed radiating part of the structure. A metallic equilateral triangular-shaped plate is analyzed by TCMs, and its first seven characteristic modes are obtained. Among them, there are two sets of degenerative modes. All these modes are orthogonal. To achieve pattern diversity, it is essential to have two or more orthogonal radiation patterns with identical excitation frequency of the relevant ports. Therefore, the aforementioned sets can be used to acquire the pattern diversity. However, from obtained results, the set with the less practical implementation issues is selected to be excited. To perform the above-mentioned modal analysis, a specific method of moments (MoM) code has been developed and applied to identify different radiating modes. Two microstrip transmission lines were used as feeding parts so as to excite the suitable set of modes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06275465.pdf","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2214198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2214198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oriented Design of an Antenna for MIMO Applications Using Theory of Characteristic Modes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna radiation patterns","MIMO","Resonant frequency","Modal analysis","Moment methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","codes","method of moments","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","modal analysis","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna oriented design","theory of characteristic mode","TCM","pattern diversity","multiple-input-multiple-output application","MIMO application","metallic equilateral triangular-shaped plate analysis","degenerative mode set","orthogonal radiation pattern","identical excitation frequency","modal analysis","method of moment code","MoM code","microstrip transmission line","antenna feeding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Method of moments (MoM)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","pattern diversity","theory of characteristic modes (TCMs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Oriented Design of an Antenna for MIMO Applications Using Theory of Characteristic Modes","volume":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6275465/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2012","accessionNumber":"13003492","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oriented Design of an Antenna for MIMO Applications Using Theory of Characteristic Modes","sourcePdf":"lawp-araghi-2214198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145179S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6275465","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6275474,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoichi Iigusa","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6365270/6275474/6275474-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyoichi Iigusa (M'08) received the B.S. degree in physics from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1985, and the M.S. degree in applied physics and the D.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1987 and 2008, respectively.","In 1987, he joined the Radio Research Laboratory, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which was renamed as the Communications Research Laboratory (currently reorganized with NICT), where he was involved in the research and development of antennas.

We model the channel as a propagation graph in which vertices represent transmitters, receivers, and scatterers, while edges represent propagation conditions between vertices. The recursive structure of the graph accounts for the exponential power decay and the avalanche effect. We derive a closed-form expression for the graph's transfer matrix. This expression is valid for any number of interactions and is straightforward to use in numerical simulations. We discuss an example where time dispersion occurs only due to propagation in between vertices. Numerical experiments reveal that the graph's recursive structure yields both an exponential power decay and an avalanche effect.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2214192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6365270/06275475.pdf","startPage":"5978","endPage":"5988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2214192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Reverberant Radio Channels Using Propagation Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275475/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Reverberant Radio Channels Using Propagation Graphs","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13150511","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275475/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Reverberant Radio Channels Using Propagation Graphs","sourcePdf":"tap-pedersen-2214192-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082739S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6365270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6365270","articleId":"6275475","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6275479,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Ming Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6472755/6275479/6275479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Ming Yang received the B.S. degree in electric engineering from Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 1999; the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2001; and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Chang Gung University in 2006.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, after a five-year career in Inotera Memories Inc. for DRAM device and retention optimization as the Department Manager of Device Engineering.

Most prior work on IA is based on the impractical assumption that perfect and global channel-state information (CSI) is available at all transmitters. However, to implement IA, each receiver has to feed back CSI to all interferers, resulting in overwhelming feedback overhead. In particular, the sum feedback rate of each receiver scales quadratically with the number of users even if the feedback CSI is quantized. To substantially suppress feedback overhead, this paper focuses on designing efficient arrangements of feedback links, called feedback topologies, under the IA constraint. For the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n-user interference channel, we propose the feedback topology that supports sequential CSI exchange (feedback and feedforward) between transmitters and receivers so as to achieve IA progressively. This feedback topology is shown to reduce the network feedback overhead from a quadratic function of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n to a linear one. To reduce the delay in the sequential CSI exchange, an alternative feedback topology is designed for supporting two-hop feedback via a control station, which also achieves the linear feedback scaling with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n. Next, given the proposed feedback topologies, the feedback-bit allocation algorithm is designed for allocating feedback bits by each receiver to different feedback links so as to regulate the residual interference caused by finite-rate feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bit allocation leads to significant throughput gains especially in strong interference environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-Topology Designs for Interference Alignment in MIMO Interference Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2214214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6357313/06275502.pdf","startPage":"6561","endPage":"6575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2214214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-Topology Designs for Interference Alignment in MIMO Interference Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6275502/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13146516","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-Topology Designs for Interference Alignment in MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2214214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152952S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6357313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6357313","articleId":"6275502","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6275503,"authors":[{"name":"Taewon Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6357313/6275503/6275503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taewon Hwang received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1993, and the M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, in 1995, respectively.

The proposed scheme is constructed by applying energy spreading transforms (EST's) to multiple data streams and spatially multiplexing the streams to multiple transmit antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed FDFR scheme outperforms the threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) code, which is a FDFR code based on maximum likelihood (ML) detection, when the number of transmit antennas (with the same number of receive antennas) are three and four.

This paper presents the fixed-point error analysis and parameter selections of MSR-CORDIC with applications to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). First, the fixed-point mean squared error of the MSR-CORDIC is analyzed by considering both the angle approximation error and signal round-off error incurred in the finite precision arithmetic. The signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR) of the output of the FFT synthesized using MSR-CORDIC is thereafter estimated. Based on these analyses, two different parameter selection algorithms of MSR-CORDIC are proposed for general and dedicated MSR-CORDIC structures. The proposed algorithms minimize the number of adders and word-length when the SQNR of the FFT output is constrained.

With the introduction of femtocells, spectrum allocation among macro base stations (MBSs) and numerous FBSs becomes challenging. WSPs will allocate resources among hierarchical infrastructures to mitigate mutual interference and maximize WSPs' revenue from service provisioning. In this paper, we propose a channel allocation and service provision framework to help WSPs allocate resources and increase revenue. The spectrum allocation and revenue maximization problem is formulated as a convex problem, and a centralized method is proposed to efficiently solve it. We also propose a distributed algorithm called LD (based on Lagrangian decomposition) to achieve a near-optimal solution with low computational and communication complexity, which can be used when the system is on a large scale. The simulation results show that our scheme can significantly improve the system's revenue.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revenue Improvement for Wireless Service Providers in Hybrid Macrocell\u2013Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2213619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6353156/06275509.pdf","startPage":"4109","endPage":"4117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2213619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Revenue Improvement for Wireless Service Providers in Hybrid Macrocell\u2013Femtocell Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6275509/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115787","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revenue Improvement for Wireless Service Providers in Hybrid Macrocell\u2013Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2213619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084224S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6353156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6353156","articleId":"6275509","onlineDate":"20 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6275516,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriela Hug","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6275510/6275516/6275516-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriela Hug (S'05\u2013M'08) was born in Baden, Switzerland.

Robots have been proved commendable in working together with patients and practitioners to achieve the common goal of well-being. Apart from high power to weight ratio and accuracy, robots are expected to be safe and flexible. At The University of Auckland we had earlier developed robots for ankle joint and lower limb rehabilitation using McKibben pneumatic muscle actuators (PMA) which were safe and flexible. However, these actuators had larger response time and hysteresis apart from compromised actuation limits. As a result of our further research we have been able to develop inhouse pleated PMA (PPMA) in our laboratory which show improved response time with low hysteresis. The newly developed actuators have larger actuation as well. In order to cope with the non-linear and transient nature of these actuators, this paper further proposes a new Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach. To optimize ANN model parameters a hybrid approach combing back propagation (BP) algorithm with Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) is developed. Results show that the hybrid approach is able to model the PPMA behaviour closely.","doi":"10.1109/MESA.2012.6275560","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 IEEE/ASME 8th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264150/6275526/06275560.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 IEEE/ASME 8th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MESA.2012.6275560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network based dynamic modelling of indigenous pneumatic muscle actuators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Actuators","Load modeling","Muscles","Neurons","Hysteresis","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electroactive polymer actuators","medical robotics","neural nets","patient rehabilitation","service robots","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","dynamic modelling","indigenous pneumatic muscle actuators","medical devices","surgical robots","rehabilitation robots","service robots","ankle joint rehabilitation","lower limb rehabilitation","McKibben pneumatic muscle actuators","inhouse pleated PMA","ANN model","backpropagation algorithm","modified genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pleated Pneumatic Muscle Actuators","Artificial Neural Networks","Dynamic Modelling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network based dynamic modelling of indigenous pneumatic muscle actuators","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275560/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948740","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network based dynamic modelling of indigenous pneumatic muscle actuators","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05037S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264150","isNumber":"6275526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264150","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6275526","articleId":"6275560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6275565,"authors":[{"name":"Adel Younis","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Younis","id":"38468890400"},{"name":"Zuomin Dong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Zuomin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37364612100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2349-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2347-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2348-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275565","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275565","abstract":"The use of approximation models in multiobjective optimization problems that involve expensive analysis and simulation processes such as multi-physics modeling and simulation, finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become more popular and more attractive, especially for the optimization of complex mechatronics systems. Approximation models have been found as a promising tool for multiobjective optimization problems due to their capability for providing accurate modeling results with much less computations for intensive computation problems. Many present global optimization search techniques involve fitness evaluations that are expensive to perform, even worse for problems with multiple objective black-box functions evaluations. In this work, a new adaptive multiobjective optimization approach based metamodeling (AMOP) techniques is introduced. The approach can identify the Pareto front for multiobjective optimization problems efficiently with high accuracy. The computation cost associated with identifying the Pareto front for expensive black-box functions is reduced. The new search method was tested using benchmark test problems and mechatronics device design examples.","doi":"10.1109/MESA.2012.6275565","startPage":"218","endPage":"223","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 IEEE/ASME 8th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264150/6275526/06275565.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2012 IEEE/ASME 8th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MESA.2012.6275565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metamodel multi-objective optimization tool for mechatronic system design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Linear programming","Algorithm design and analysis","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational fluid dynamics","design engineering","finite element analysis","mechatronics","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metamodel multiobjective optimization tool","mechatronic system design","approximation model","multiphysics modeling","multiphysics simulation","finite element analysis","FEA","computational fluid dynamics","CFD","global optimization search technique","fitness evaluation","black-box functions evaluation","AMOP technique","Pareto front","computation cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","approximation models","response surface function","radial basis function","Kriging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Metamodel multi-objective optimization tool for mechatronic system design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275565/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948744","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamodel multi-objective optimization tool for mechatronic system design","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115509S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264150","isNumber":"6275526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264150","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6275526","articleId":"6275565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6275640,"authors":[{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashichou, Kagawa, Japan","Harbin Engineering University"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"},{"name":"Shilian Mao","affiliation":["Graduate school of Kagawa University, Hayashichou, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Mao","id":"38059839200"},{"name":"Liwei Shi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashichou, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37531265800"},{"name":"Maoxun Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Maoxun","lastName":"Li","id":"38468707800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1618-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1617-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275640","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275640","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propulsion","Servomotors","Actuators","Legged locomotion","Axles","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","intelligent materials","legged locomotion","microactuators","microrobots","motion control","propellers","servomotors","underwater vehicles","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amphibious mother spherical robot","underwater microrobots","smart material actuated microrobots","locomotion speed","short operating time","mother-son multirobots cooperation system","GSL system","power supply","locomotion system","water-jet propeller","servo motors","walking mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spherical underwater robot","Amphibious robot","Water-jet propeller","Quadruped walking","Mother robot"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, smart materials actuated microrobots are widely used when dealing with complicated missions in limited spaces. But problems still exist in this kind of solutions, such as low locomotion speed and short operating time. To solve these problems, we propose a mother-son multi-robots cooperation system, named GSL system, which included several microrobots as son robots, and a novel designed amphibious spherical robot as the mother robot. The mother robot, called GSLMom, was designed to be able to carry microrobots and provide power supply for them. This paper will talk about the structure and mechanism of the GSLMom robot. The GSLMom robot was designed as an amphibious spherical one. The robot was equipped with a 4 unit locomotion system, and each unit consists of a water-jet propeller and two servo motors. Each servo motor could rotate 90\u00b0 in horizontal and 120\u00b0 in vertical direction respectively. When moving in water, servo motors controlled the directions of water jet propellers and the 4 propellers work to actuate the robot. In the ground situation, propellers were used as legs, and servo motors actuated these legs to realize walking mechanism. After discussed structures, experiments were conducted to evaluate performance of the actuators.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275640","publicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247530/6275588/06275640.pdf","startPage":"758","endPage":"762","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of an amphibious mother spherical robot used as the carrier for underwater microrobots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Development of an amphibious mother spherical robot used as the carrier for underwater microrobots","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6275640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948602","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275640/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an amphibious mother spherical robot used as the carrier for underwater microrobots","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"CME2012051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07258S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247530","isNumber":"6275588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247530","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6275588","articleId":"6275640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6275641,"authors":[{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Faculty a/Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"},{"name":"Maoxun Li","affiliation":["Graduate school of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Maoxun","lastName":"Li","id":"38468707800"},{"name":"Liwei Shi","affiliation":["Graduate school of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37531265800"},{"name":"Shilian Mao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Mao","id":"38059839200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1618-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1617-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275641","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a novel underwater biomimetic microrobot with two motion attitudes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275641","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Propulsion","Clocks","Relays","Actuators","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attitude control","biomimetics","legged locomotion","microactuators","microrobots","motion control","underwater vehicles","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel underwater biomimetic microrobot","two motion attitudes","biomedical engineering","underwater operation","compact structure","low driving voltage","simple control system","underwater missions","walking biomimetic microrobot","ICPF","ionic conducting polymer film actuators","locomotion control","shape memory alloy actuators","lying structure","stick insect-inspired walking-rotating motions","fish-like swimming motion","ICPF tail fin","horizontal grasping motion","ICPF fingers","floating motion","electrolyzing water","standing structure","inchworm-inspired crawling motion","vertical grasping motion","prototype","floating speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater microrobot","Motion attitudes","ICPF actuator","SMA actuator","Biomimetic locomotion"]}],"abstract":"In the last few years, various microrobots were applied more and more in the fields of biomedical engineering and underwater operation. By having a compact structure, low driving voltage and a simple control system, microrobots could do a variety of underwater missions, especially in limited spaces. To realize the purpose of multifunction of the microrobot aiming at adapting to the complex underwater environment, we proposed a walking biomimetic microrobot which had two kinds of motion attitudes. The microrobot used eleven ICPF (ionic conducting polymer film) actuators for locomotion and missions and two SMA (shape memory alloy) actuators for attitude change. In lying structure, the microrobot could implement stick insect-inspired walking/rotating motions by using eight ICPF legs, fish-like swimming motion by using one ICPF tail fin, horizontal grasping motion by using two ICPF fingers, and floating motion by electrolyzing water. In standing structure, it could implement inchworm-inspired crawling motion along two directions and vertical grasping motion by using inside four legs. Then we developed a prototype of multi-functional biomimetic microrobot and evaluated the walking speed and floating speed experimentally for performance testing.","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275641","publicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247530/6275588/06275641.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Development of a novel underwater biomimetic microrobot with two motion attitudes","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275641/","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948603","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275641/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a novel underwater biomimetic microrobot with two motion attitudes","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"CME2012052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072042S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247530","isNumber":"6275588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247530","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6275588","articleId":"6275641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6275644,"authors":[{"name":"Koh Inoue","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Mechanical Systems Engineering, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Koh","lastName":"Inoue","id":"38468804500"},{"name":"Hiroaki Hobara","affiliation":["Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Hobara","id":"38468679300"},{"name":"Takahiro Wada","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Wada","id":"37329590300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1618-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1617-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275644","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid fiber coaxial cables","Hip","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial motion","joint moments","knee joint motion","half-foot contact","full-foot contact","computer simulation","transfemoral prosthetic leg swinging","able-bodied subjects","prosthetic knees","transfemoral amputation","motor task","step-over-step gait","stair ascending","swing phase","lower extremity","foot placement effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transfemoral prosthesis","Stair ascending","Foot placement","Inertial properties"]}],"abstract":"Stair ascending, especially step-over-step gait, is a difficult motor task for people with transfemoral amputation. Although many types prosthetic knees have been developed to attempt such locomotion, finding alternative methods is also important. The purposes of the present study were to (a) elucidate the effects of foot placement, as part of stair ascending strategies, on the lower extremity motion of able-bodied subjects and (b) investigate the effectiveness of these strategies on transfemoral prosthetic leg swinging during stair ascending in a computer simulation. In the experiment, 2 different foot placement strategies on a step were conducted with able-bodied subjects: the full-foot contact (FFC) and half-foot contact (HFC) strategies. HFC made the toe trajectory straighter, mainly owing to the knee joint motion. The joint moments at the hip and knee were smaller in the HFC condition than the FFC condition. These results suggest that HFC causes the leg swing to have more inertial motion than FFC and demonstrate the applicability of the HFC condition for transfemoral prostheses without any actuators. In the computer simulation based on the results of the first experiment, various inertial properties of a transfemoral prosthesis were examined to accomplish leg swing without tripping. Only in the HFC condition specific inertial properties allowed the prosthesis to avoid colliding with the stairs. These simulation results suggest that with natural motion, transfemoral prostheses without assistive devices could allow successful leg swing for step-over-step gait with the HFC condition and appropriate inertial properties.","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275644","publicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247530/6275588/06275644.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of foot placement on the lower extremity in the swing phase during stair ascending: Implications for transfemoral prostheses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275644/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of foot placement on the lower extremity in the swing phase during stair ascending: Implications for transfemoral prostheses","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948606","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275644/","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of foot placement on the lower extremity in the swing phase during stair ascending: Implications for transfemoral prostheses","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"CME2012055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076708S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247530","isNumber":"6275588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247530","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6275588","articleId":"6275644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275663,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Balouchestani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Balouchestani","id":"37703670400"},{"name":"Kaamran Raahemifar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Kaamran","lastName":"Raahemifar","id":"37273545200"},{"name":"Sridhar Krishnan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Sridhar","lastName":"Krishnan","id":"37275777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1618-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1617-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275663","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1114},"abstract":"With the rapid advancements of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), wireless communication, and electronic technologies the area of wireless networks has grown significantly supporting a range of applications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) including Electronic Health (EH) and Mobile health (MH). Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) consist of small intelligent wireless sensors attached on or implanted in the body. These wireless sensors are responsible for collecting, processing, and transmitting vital information such as: blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, electrocardiographic (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), oxygenation signals, respiratory rate, and temperature to provide continuous health monitoring with real-time feedback to the users and medical centers. In order to fully exploit the benefits of WBANs for important applications such as EH, MH, and Ambulatory Health Monitoring (AHM), the power consumption must be minimized. Each Wireless Node (WN) in WBANs must be designed to manage its local power supply in order to maximize total network lifetime. With this in mind, we want to employ Compressed Sensing (CS) to WBANs theory as a new sampling procedure to reduce load of sampling rate and minimize power consumption. Our simulation results show that sampling rate can be reduced to 30% of Nyquist Rate (NR) and power consumption to 40% in ECG signals without sacrificing reliability and availability by employing the CS theory to WBANs. This paper presents a novel sampling approach to WBANs using compressive sensing methods to WBANs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6247530/6275588/06275663.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"2012 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering (CME)","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Body Area Networks with compressed sensing theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical measurements","Frequency measurement","Power measurement","Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","body area networks","compressed sensing","electrocardiography","electroencephalography","haemodynamics","intelligent sensors","medical signal processing","Nyquist stability","personal area networks","pneumodynamics","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless body area networks","compressed sensing theory","wireless sensor networks","wireless communication","electronic health","mobile health","intelligent wireless sensors","blood pressure","heart rate","respiration rate","electrocardiographic signals","ECG","electroencephalography","EEG","oxygenation signals","respiratory rate","body temperature","ambulatory health monitoring","power consumption","Nyquist rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Body Area Network","Sampling-rate","Power consumption","Spares signal","Compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Body Area Networks with compressed sensing theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275663/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948625","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Body Area Networks with compressed sensing theory","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"CME2012074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061058S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247530","isNumber":"6275588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247530","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6275588","articleId":"6275663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6275670,"authors":[{"name":"Franck Ruffier","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Science, Biorobotics Department, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France","UMR7287, CNRS, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Ruffier","id":"37282466500"},{"name":"Fabien Expert","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Science, Biorobotics Department, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France","UMR7287, CNRS, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Expert","id":"38235252000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1618-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1617-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275670","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical sensors","Robot sensing systems","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","Bluetooth","control engineering computing","image sequences","lighting","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual motion sensing onboard","free-flying helicopter","complex VICON-lighting conditions","ground avoidance","terrain following","takeoff","landing","optic flow sensors","tethered flying robot","OCTAVE","programmable visual motion sensor","Bluetooth module","TwinCoax","IR-reflective markers","ground-truth optic flow","free-flying helicopter trajectory","optical altitude control system for autonomous vehicles","mass 50 g"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elementary motion detector (EMD)","Optic flow","Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV)","Free-flying Helicopter"]}],"abstract":"In previous studies, we described how complicated tasks such as ground avoidance, terrain following, takeoff and landing can be performed using optic flow sensors mounted on a tethered flying robot called OCTAVE.

Methods: We acquired interictal MEG data using a whole-head 151channel gradiometer system in 35 children with intractable neocortical epilepsy. We visually identified the earliest peak of each spike, by examining the raw MEG recordings using a band pass filter of 15-70 Hz. We used a spatiotemporal beamforming method to estimate the spatial distribution of source power in individual interictal spikes over the whole brain. The resulting volumetric source power images of individual spikes were then averaged and the results displayed on the patient's MRI. We compared the results to the localization obtained using the equivalent current dipole model and to the ictal onset zones on IVEEG. Results: Thirty-one patients had a single MEG dipole cluster. Four patients had more than 2 MEG spike source (MEGSS) clusters. Twenty-three patients showed focal ERB, including a single focal ERB 16 (46%) patients, and more than 2 ERBs in 7 (20%) patients. The Euclidean distance between the centroid of the MEGSS cluster and the ERB was less than 2 cm in 27 (77%) patients. The distance between the centroid of the MEGSS cluster and ERB was less than 2 cm in 21/23 patients with focal ERB (mean, 1.19cm; SD, 0.65cm ). ERB was localized within the ictal onset zone gyral in 24 (69 %) patients, regional concordance was seen in 8 (23 %) patients and discordant in 3 (8 %) patients. A focal ERB was associated with concordant seizure localization (p=0.02) while all three patients with discordant IVEEG and ERB activation had multiple ERB foci. Maximum ERB was included in the resection margin in 28 (80 %) patients. In 23 patients with focal ERB, the ERB area was included in the resection margin in 22 (95 %) patients. A favorable surgical outcome was obtained in 17 (74 %) with a focal ERB. Conclusion: ERB for interictal MEG spikes highly corresponded to the center of the MEGSS clusters and ictal onset zones localized on IVEEG. The frequency analysis of interictal MEG spikes may correlate with a subset of the epileptogenic high frequency oscillations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275692/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12948654","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275692/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Source localization using event related beamformer of magnetoencephalography for interictal spikes in pediatric neocortical epilepsy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source localization using event related beamformer of magnetoencephalography for interictal spikes in pediatric neocortical epilepsy","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"CME2012103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074885S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6247530","isNumber":"6275588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6247530","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6275588","articleId":"6275692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275721,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Kondo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37281328200"},{"name":"Junji Ueno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Ueno","id":"37590226800"},{"name":"Shoichiro Takao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoichiro","lastName":"Takao","id":"38481156500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1618-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1617-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6275721","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275721","abstract":"A revised Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural network algorithm for medical image diagnosis is proposed, and is applied to medical image diagnosis of lung cancer.

However, charging sensor node one at a time poses a serious scalability problem. Recent advances in magnetic resonant coupling shows that multiple nodes can be charged at the same time. In this paper, we exploit this multi-node wireless energy transfer technology to address energy issue in a WSN. We consider a wireless charging vehicle (WCV) periodically traveling inside a WSN and charging sensor nodes wirelessly. We propose a cellular structure that partitions the two-dimensional plane into adjacent hexagonal cells. The WCV visits these cells and charge sensor nodes from the center of a cell. We pursue a formal optimization framework by jointly optimizing traveling path, flow routing and charging time. By employing discretization and a novel Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT), we develop a provably near-optimal solution for any desired level of accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On renewable sensor networks with wireless energy transfer: The multi-node case","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275766","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275766.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"On renewable sensor networks with wireless energy transfer: The multi-node case","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275766/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948763","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On renewable sensor networks with wireless energy transfer: The multi-node case","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p10xie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068857S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":6275773,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Pu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406354800"},{"name":"Ian F.

To encounter this, a new stability criterion, namely moment stability, is introduced, which requires that the queue length of each secondary user has finite moments for every achievable order. Then, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a resource allocation policy to achieve moment stability are derived. Moreover, the network stability region yielded from these conditions is shown to be directly related to the statistics of secondary user traffics, primary user activities, the number of secondary users contending the spectrum, and the total number of primary user channels available to secondary users. In addition, a throughput-optimal policy, which stabilizes the network for any arrival rates in the stability region, is also introduced. In the end, the impact of the heavy tailed primary user traffic on the network stability is investigated, which shows that the tail heaviness of the primary user traffics determines what types of the network stability are achievable for a dynamic spectrum networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275773.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network stability of cognitive radio networks in the presence of heavy tailed traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Steady-state","Delay","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","resource allocation","stability","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","network stability","heavy tailed traffic","dynamic spectrum networks","moment stability","queue length","finite moments","resource allocation policy","secondary user traffics","primary user channels","throughput-optimal policy","heavy tailed primary user traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Network stability of cognitive radio networks in the presence of heavy tailed traffic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275773/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948770","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network stability of cognitive radio networks in the presence of heavy tailed traffic","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p165wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056976S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6275776,"authors":[{"name":"Colin O'Reilly","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"O'Reilly","id":"37085860581"},{"name":"Alex Gluhak","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Gluhak","id":"37547231200"},{"name":"Muhammad Imran","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"},{"name":"Sutharshan Rajasegarar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Sutharshan","lastName":"Rajasegarar","id":"37403126000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275776","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"abstract":"Anomaly detection in a Wireless Sensor Network is an important aspect of data analysis in order to facilitate intrusion and event detection. A key challenge is creating optimal classifiers constructed from training sets in which the anomaly rates are varying due to the existence of non-stationary distributions in the data. In this paper we propose an adaptive algorithm that can dynamically adjust the anomaly rate parameter, which can be represented by a model parameter of a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine. This algorithm operates in an online, iterative manner producing an optimal model for a training set, which is presented sequentially. Our evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of constructing optimal models for a training set that minimizes the error rate on the classification set compared to a static model, where the anomaly rate is kept stationary.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275776.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"199","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online anomaly rate parameter tracking for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Vectors","Kernel","Data models","Support vector machines","Adaptation models","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","security of data","support vector machines","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","online anomaly rate parameter tracking","anomaly detection","data analysis","intrusion detection","event detection","optimal classifiers","nonstationary distributions","one-class quarter-sphere","support vector machine","iterative manner"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Network","Anomaly Detection","Security","Non-Stationary Environment","Concept Drift","Adaptive Models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Online anomaly rate parameter tracking for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275776/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948773","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online anomaly rate parameter tracking for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p191oreilly.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058299S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6275780,"authors":[{"name":"Jalaluddin Qureshi","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jalaluddin","lastName":"Qureshi","id":"37410102200"},{"name":"Chuan Heng Foh","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chuan Heng","lastName":"Foh","id":"37272792200"},{"name":"Jianfei Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jianfei","lastName":"Cai","id":"37291518400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275780","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Receivers","Decoding","Indexes","Network coding","Throughput","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","Galois fields","mobile handsets","multicast communication","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal solution","index coding problem","network coding","GF(2)","transmission problem","multicast networks","computational complexity","packet encoding","packet decoding","finite field size","energy constraint","mobile phones","wireless sensors"]}],"abstract":"The index coding problem is a fundamental transmission problem which occurs in a wide range of multicast networks. Network coding over a large finite field size has been shown to be a theoretically efficient solution to the index coding problem. However the high computational complexity of packet encoding and decoding over a large finite field size, and its subsequent penalty on encoding and decoding throughput and higher energy cost makes it unsuitable for practical implementation in processor and energy constraint devices like mobile phones and wireless sensors. While network coding over GF(2) can alleviate these concerns, it comes at a tradeoff cost of degrading throughput performance. To address this tradeoff, we propose a throughput optimal triangular network coding scheme over GF(2). We show that such a coding scheme can supply unlimited number of innovative packets and the decoding involves the simple back substitution. Such a coding scheme provides an efficient solution to the index coding problem and its lower computation and energy cost makes it suitable for practical implementation on devices with limited processing and energy capacity.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275780","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275780.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal solution for the index coding problem using network coding over GF(2)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275780/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal solution for the index coding problem using network coding over GF(2)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948777","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275780/","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal solution for the index coding problem using network coding over GF(2)","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p209qureshi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101411S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275782,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chung Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Li-Chung","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37710002900"},{"name":"Tommaso Melodia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Melodia","id":"37266571400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275782","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Receivers","Diversity methods","Routing","Underwater acoustics","Protocols","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","MIMO communication","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters","routing protocols","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed cross-layer routing algorithm","MIMO-OFDM underwater acoustic link","underwater acoustic sensor network","UW-ASN","commercial application","military application","oceanographic data collection","pollution monitoring","offshore exploration","disaster prevention","tactical surveillance","communication protocol","underwater acoustic communication channel","variable propagation delay","multimedia underwater monitoring application","heterogeneous traffic demand","end-to-end reliability","delay-insensitive application","delay-sensitive application","energy consumption reduction","power transmission allocation","quality of service","QoS","radio transmitter","radio receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater acoustic sensor networks","Routing algorithm","MIMO-OFDM","Cross-layer design","Performance evaluation"]}],"abstract":"UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) are experiencing a rapid growth, due to their high relevance to commercial and military applications such as oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, and tactical surveillance. However, the design of efficient communication protocols for underwater sensor networks is still an open research problem due to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic communication channel such as limited bandwidth, high and variable propagation delays, and significant multipath and scattering. In this paper, we consider multimedia underwater monitoring applications with heterogeneous traffic demands in terms of bandwidth and end-to-end reliability. Distributed routing algorithms are introduced for delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive applications, with the objective of reducing the energy consumption by i) leveraging the tradeoff between multiplexing and diversity gain that characterizes MIMO links, and ii) allocating transmit power on suitable subcarriers according to channel conditions and application requirements. To achieve the objective above, each node jointly i) selects its next hop, ii) chooses a suitable transmission mode, and iii) assigns optimal transmit power on different subcarriers to achieve a target level of Quality of Service (QoS) in a cross-layer fashion. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocol is adaptive to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic communication channel, and achieves excellent performance through local cooperations between transmitter and receiver.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275782","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275782.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer routing on MIMO-OFDM underwater acoustic links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275782/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer routing on MIMO-OFDM underwater acoustic links","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948779","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275782/","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer routing on MIMO-OFDM underwater acoustic links","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p227kuo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064907S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275786,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Malandrino","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Malandrino","id":"37400927900"},{"name":"Claudio Casetti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Casetti","id":"37266445800"},{"name":"Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Carla-Fabiana","lastName":"Chiasserini","id":"37275293800"},{"name":"Marco Fiore","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INRIA, INSA-Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Fiore","id":"38480403700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275786","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":530},"abstract":"Content downloading by mobile users is expected to significantly increase the cellular network load. Vehicular users, in particular, are likely to engage in information retrieval on the move: in this context, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can play an important role in offloading the cellular infrastructure. We investigate the effectiveness of ITS in this task, considering that roadside units (RSUs) can exploit mobility prediction to decide which data they should fetch from the Internet and schedule transmissions to vehicles, either potential relays or downloaders. Rather than presenting a specific prediction scheme, we propose a model that allows us to express and account for any prediction technique in a simple, yet effective, manner. We then provide a probabilistic graph-based representation of the system that accounts for the prediction uncertainty. We use such a representation to study the network dynamics by efficiently solving a (non-integer) LP problem. Our results show that the above approach to content downloading through ITS can achieve an 80% offload of the cellular network. Also, we investigate the dependency of the system performance on the accuracy of the mobility prediction, and which prediction errors have the largest impact.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275786.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offloading cellular networks through ITS content download","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Relays","Prefetching","Predictive models","Accuracy","Mobile communication","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","information retrieval","Internet","scheduling","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offloading cellular networks","ITS content download","mobile users","vehicular users","information retrieval","intelligent transportation systems","roadside units","Internet","schedule transmissions","probabilistic graph-based representation","prediction uncertainty","LP problem","mobility prediction","prediction errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Offloading cellular networks through ITS content download","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948783","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offloading cellular networks through ITS content download","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p263malandrino.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108004S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275800,"authors":[{"name":"Furqan H.

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is often used to reduce energy consumption in systems where sleep is not an option. We show that changing the CPU frequency introduces sudden changes in clock behavior, thereby affecting the time-keeping functionality. This anomalous phenomenon is observed in different sensor platforms and causes a loss of time synchronization among nodes that is unacceptable to applications such as structural health monitoring that require tightly synchronized clocks over extended periods. The paper provides experimental measurements of the clock value shift anomaly in three widely used wireless sensor platforms and its impact on clock synchronization costs. A general framework balancing the need to save energy against the need to keep clocks synchronized is developed. Our system is implemented and evaluated on a network of sensors deployed on a truss bridge and running a high-fidelity structural health monitoring application. Experimental measurements confirm the efficacy of the solution in saving energy while maintaining an acceptable level of synchronization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The time-keeping anomaly of energy-saving sensors: Manifestation, solution, and a structural monitoring case study","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275801","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275801.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"The time-keeping anomaly of energy-saving sensors: Manifestation, solution, and a structural monitoring case study","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275801/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948797","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The time-keeping anomaly of energy-saving sensors: Manifestation, solution, and a structural monitoring case study","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p380moinzadeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096062S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6275806,"authors":[{"name":"Weifei Zeng","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Weifei","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38469078100"},{"name":"Chris T.

We investigate such trade-offs using a random linear network coding scheme for one or more receivers in single hop wireless packet erasure broadcast channels. We capture the delay sensitivities across different types of network applications using a class of delay metrics based on the norms of packet arrival times. With these delay metrics, we establish a unified framework to characterize the rate and delay requirements of applications and to optimize system parameters. In the single receiver case, we demonstrate the trade-off between average packet delay, which we view as the inverse of throughput, and maximum inorder inter-arrival delay for various system parameters. For a single broadcast channel with multiple receivers having different delay constraints and feedback delays, we jointly optimize the coding parameters and time-division scheduling parameters at the transmitter. We formulate the optimization problem as a Generalized Geometric Program (GGP). This approach allows the transmitter to adjust adaptively the coding and scheduling parameters for efficient allocation of network resources under varying delay constraints. In the case where the receivers are served by multiple non-interfering wireless broadcast channels, the same optimization problem is formulated as a Signomial Program, which is NP-hard in general. We provide approximation methods using successive formulation of geometric programs and show the convergence of approximations.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275806","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275806.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint coding and scheduling optimization in wireless systems with varying delay sensitivities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275806/","displayDocTitle":"Joint coding and scheduling optimization in wireless systems with varying delay sensitivities","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948802","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275806/","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint coding and scheduling optimization in wireless systems with varying delay sensitivities","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p416zeng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065229S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6275807,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tie","lastName":"Luo","id":"37403753600"},{"name":"Chen-Khong Tham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen-Khong","lastName":"Tham","id":"37302074200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275807","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":665},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275807","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Incentive schemes","Quality of service","Indexes","Nash equilibrium","Games","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Global Positioning System","minimax techniques","Pareto optimisation","public administration","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentivizing participatory sensing","social welfare","large-scale data collection","users demand","compelling services","demand-based principle","demand fairness incentive","iterative tank filling","max-min fair","Jain fairness index","Nash equilibrium","Pareto optimal","globally optimal","game theoretic approach","optimal service demands","stochastic programming"]}],"abstract":"Participatory sensing has emerged recently as a promising approach to large-scale data collection. However, without incentives for users to regularly contribute good quality data, this method is unlikely to be viable in the long run. In this paper, we link incentive to users' demand for consuming compelling services, as an approach complementary to conventional credit or reputation based approaches. With this demand-based principle, we design two incentive schemes, Incentive with Demand Fairness (IDF) and Iterative Tank Filling (ITF), for maximizing fairness and social welfare, respectively. Our study shows that the IDF scheme is max-min fair and can score close to 1 on the Jain's fairness index, while the ITF scheme maximizes social welfare and achieves a unique Nash equilibrium which is also Pareto and globally optimal. We adopted a game theoretic approach to derive the optimal service demands. Furthermore, to address practical considerations, we use a stochastic programming technique to handle uncertainty that is often encountered in real life situations.","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275807.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"433","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness and social welfare in incentivizing participatory sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fairness and social welfare in incentivizing participatory sensing","htmlLink":"/document/6275807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12948803","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness and social welfare in incentivizing participatory sensing","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p425luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070836S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6275809,"authors":[{"name":"Rohan Gandhi","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Gandhi","id":"38468968100"},{"name":"Chih-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Chih-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068552500"},{"name":"Y.

We study blind rendezvous, where users search for each other without any infrastructural aid. Previous work in this area have focused on efficient blind rendezvous algorithms for two users but the solution for multiple users is still far from optimal. In particular, when two users encounter, one user inherits the other's hopping sequence but the sequence is never shortened or split among the encountering users. We denote this class of algorithms as uncoordinated channel hopping algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new class of distributed algorithms for multi-user blind rendezvous, called Coordinated Channel Hopping (CCH), where users adjust, or coordinate, the sequence of channels being hopped as they rendezvous pairwise. Compared to existing rendezvous algorithms, our algorithms achieve 80% lower Time To Rendezvous (TTR) in case of multiple users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12948805","htmlLink":"/document/6275809/","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast rendezvous for multiple clients for cognitive radios using coordinated channel hopping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast rendezvous for multiple clients for cognitive radios using coordinated channel hopping","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p434gandhi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119467S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275813,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Mollanoori","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Mollanoori","id":"37680795700"},{"name":"Majid Ghaderi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ghaderi","id":"37274408700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275813","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Media Access Protocol","Silicon carbide","Physical layer","Decoding","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","game theory","interference suppression","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive interference cancellation","SIC enabled networks","random access networks","overlapping transmissions","network throughput","SIC aware MAC protocol","user channels","base configuration","one shot simultaneous move game","Nash equilibrium","packet transmission","optimal system throughput"]}],"abstract":"Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is a physical-layer technique that enables reception of multiple overlapping transmissions. While SIC has the potential to boost the network throughput, if the MAC protocol employed in the network is agnostic to such a capability at the physical-layer, the full potential of SIC can not be utilized in the network. There have been a number of studies to design new SIC-aware MAC protocols or adjust the existing protocols to exploit SIC. Despite that, the exact effect of MAC protocols on the throughput of SIC-enabled networks is unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel SIC-aware MAC protocol based on the disparity of user channels in a wireless network and analyze its performance. We consider a simple random access protocol with no SIC as the base configuration and compare it with three other configurations with different levels of SIC-awareness. We show that while a SIC-enabled physical layer without a SIC-aware MAC protocol can increase the throughput of the network by 1.5\u00d7, a specifically designed MAC protocol is far more efficient achieving up to 3.3\u00d7 improvement in throughput. Our SIC-aware MAC protocol is fully distributed and hence subject to selfish behavior of users. Thus, we also consider the case where the users behave selfishly. We model our proposed protocol as a one-shot simultaneous move game and derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. We also show that we can set the cost of packet transmission in such a way that we get the optimal system throughput at the Nash equilibrium.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of successive interference cancellation in random access networks","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275813","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275813.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of successive interference cancellation in random access networks","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6275813/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948809","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of successive interference cancellation in random access networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p461mollanoori.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116785S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275819,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085489792"},{"name":"Lance Kaplan","affiliation":["Networked Sensing & Fusion Branch, US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi"],"firstName":"Lance","lastName":"Kaplan","id":"37271026000"},{"name":"Tarek Abdelzaher","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Abdelzaher","id":"37267896800"},{"name":"Charu C.

Scalable and robust estimation of source reliability is a key challenge in social sensing where humans or human-operated sensors act as data sources. In order to assess correctness of data, the reliability of sources must first be assessed, yet this is complicated when sources are not a priori known and vetted, but rather can opt in at will, for example, by downloading a sensing application on their mobile device. In our previous work, we developed a maximum likelihood source reliability estimator and approximately quantified confidence in its estimation based on an asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). In this paper we show that the asymptotic bound fails to track estimation performance when the number of sources is small. We derive the real CRLB to accurately characterize estimation performance for scenarios where the asymptotic bound fails. We study the limitations of the real and asymptotic CRLBs and show the trade-offs they offer between computational complexity and estimation scalability. We also evaluate the robustness of these bounds to changes in the number of sources. The results offer an understanding of attainable estimation accuracy of source reliability in social sensing applications that rely on un-vetted sources whose reliability is not known in advance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","startPage":"506","endPage":"514","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275819.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On scalability and robustness limitations of real and asymptotic confidence bounds in social sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6275819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6275819/","displayDocTitle":"On scalability and robustness limitations of real and asymptotic confidence bounds in social sensing","conferenceDate":"18-21 June 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12948815","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On scalability and robustness limitations of real and asymptotic confidence bounds in social sensing","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"p506wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060199S","chronDate":"18-21 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6265425","isNumber":"6275759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6265425","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6275759","articleId":"6275819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6275837,"authors":[{"name":"Boram Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Boram","lastName":"Choi","id":"38239370200"},{"name":"Hyuk Lim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuk","lastName":"Lim","id":"37082407300"},{"name":"Hyunduk Kang","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunduk","lastName":"Kang","id":"38183830500"},{"name":"Byung-Jang Jeong","affiliation":["Radio Technology Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Jang","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37270067500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1905-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1904-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1903-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2155-5486"}],"articleNumber":"6275837","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6275837","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Throughput","Cognitive radio","Dynamic scheduling","Quality of service","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","quality of service","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","dynamic priority scheduling","secondary networks","primary networks","channel information exchange","coexistence manager","channel access scheduling","quality-of-service","QoS differentiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coexistence","cognitive radio networks","priority scheduling","quality-of-service"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SECON.2012.6275837","publicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6265425/6275759/06275837.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2012.6275837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6275759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic priority scheduling for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), secondary networks (SNs) are regulated in order to prevent them from accessing a channel if primary networks (PNs) are currently occupying the channel.

With perfect channel state information (CSI), a closed-form expression for the maximum secondary received-power is found. Under imperfect CSI and when the beamforming weights are computed using the channel estimates, the actual secondary received-power, G, and the actual primary interference-power, I, are derived. We show that the mean E[G] has a term that grows linearly with the number of secondary antennas, N, and additional terms dependent on \u2208. Consequently, we obtain tradeoffs between E[G] and c. Under perfect CSI, we show that small increases in c from zero lead to moderate enhancements in E[G] for small N. However, increasing N reduces the enhancements. Under imperfect CSI, the gain in E[G] is less compared to the perfect CSI case. Furthermore, we show that the dominant parts of E[I] are independent of N. Thus, we conclude that there is no significant loss for the secondary to perform null-steering beamforming instead. Moreover, it can employ additional antennas to improve E[G] without generating significant extra interference on the primary.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","volume":"11","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13057122","publicationDate":"October 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6276194/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Tradeoffs Offered by Beamforming in Cognitive Radio Systems: An Analytic Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Tradeoffs Offered by Beamforming in Cognitive Radio Systems: An Analytic Approach","sourcePdf":"3766-tw1210-jamal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097965S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6333589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6333589","articleId":"6276194","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6276195,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6333589/6276195/6276195-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Yang (S'09-M'11) received the B.S. degree in Electronics from China Agricultural University, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2010.

We propose optimal (under an assumption of zero other-cell interference) and suboptimal transmit/receive beamforming vectors through zero-forcing IA-CBF algorithms. We also investigate the optimality of the proposed IA-CBF algorithms with respect to the number of receive antennas. Numerical results confirm that the proposed system with two transmit/receive antennas achieves the full degrees of freedom (a.k.a. multiplexing gain) of the two-cell multiple-input multiple-output channel while showing a better sum rate performance than competitive solutions such as non-cooperative eigen-beamforming and interference nulling.

Much of the complexity is due to the computation of the covariance matrix corresponding to the least favorable noise. Additionally GDFE implementation requires the base stations (BS) to feedback filter coefficients to the users thus increasing overhead. In this paper, we address both the aspects - computational complexity and feedback overhead. We first propose an alternative framework for realizing the GDFE precoder, which avoids the explicit computation of the least favorable noise. We show that, while maintaining capacity optimality of the GDFE precoder, the proposed algorithm has significantly lower complexity. Next, we propose another algorithm which does not require the feedback of filter coefficients from BS to users with minimal loss in achievable capacity. Thus our algorithms are a step towards adopting GDFE precoders in future wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.081312.112125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6333589/06276199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.081312.112125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6333589","startPage":"3668","endPage":"3676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical GDFE Precoder for Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Practical GDFE Precoder for Multiuser MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13057127","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6276199/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical GDFE Precoder for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"3668-tw1210-gaur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079248S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6333589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6333589","articleId":"6276199","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6276204,"authors":[{"name":"Ferkan Yilmaz","affiliation":["KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ferkan","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37408923000"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6276204","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":587},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Fading","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity reception","Wireless communication","Higher order statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","fading channels","higher order statistics","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized fading channels","channel capacity","higher-order statistics","unified analysis","moment generating function","maximal-ratio-combining receivers","correlated generalized fading environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Higher-order statistics of the channel capacity","ergodic capacity","maximal-ratio combining","correlated fading distributions","correlated non-central chi-squared distributions"]}],"abstract":"The higher-order statistics (HOS) of the channel capacity \u03bc\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sub>\n = E[ log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n(1+\u03b3\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">end</sub>\n)], where n \u2208 N denotes the order of the statistics, has received relatively little attention in the literature, due in part to the intractability of its analysis.

Inspired by human brain, the CRs extract and memorize the activity patterns of the primary network and other CRs and create temporal channel assignments on sub-bands with no recent primary user activities using a self-organizing maps (SOM) technique. The proposed scheme is decentralized and employs a simple learning rule with low complexity and minimal memory requirements.

The resource allocation process is based on the dual solution of a weighted sum-rate maximization problem. In particular, to realistically address IP-based video and data communications, the set of considered constraints include the number of bits actually present in the different transmission buffers. Furthermore, we propose an innovative AMC solution, based on M-QAM modulation and LDPC codes, jointly working with the scheduler and capable to maximize the throughput while guaranteeing a given set of performance requirements. A simple weight adaptation algorithm is introduced to properly tune the trade off between opportunistic transmissions and fairness among users. Several simulation results are presented to validate the proposed approach and a comparison with more traditional schemes is provided. In particular, we show that a good trade off between user fairness and opportunistic exploitation of the radio channel can be reached with the proposed strategies, improving the communication quality for both real-time video and non real-time data applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6331703/06276209.pdf","startPage":"2915","endPage":"2925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Resource Allocation with Adaptive Modulation and LDPC Coding for Heterogeneous Traffic in OFDMA Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Resource Allocation with Adaptive Modulation and LDPC Coding for Heterogeneous Traffic in OFDMA Downlink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276209/","publicationDate":"October 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13056953","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6276209/","volume":"60","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Resource Allocation with Adaptive Modulation and LDPC Coding for Heterogeneous Traffic in OFDMA Downlink","sourcePdf":"2915-tc1210-mazzotti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075762S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6331703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6331703","articleId":"6276209","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6276210,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Blasco-Serrano","affiliation":["Communication Theory Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6362326/6276210/6276210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ricardo Blasco-Serrano (S'05) received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Spain, in 2007.

In the first case we prove that polar codes are capacity achieving for the physically degraded relay channel; for stochastically degraded relay channels our construction provides an achievable rate.

The messages on the graph are obtained by making large system assumptions for the user symbols and Gaussian assumptions for the messages related to the channel parameters.

To support prioritized transmissions, the unequal error protection (UEP) for multi-resolution multimedia sources can be realized through MBMS. Nevertheless, the enhancement on the transmission fidelity in base layer typically sacrifices the fidelity of enhancement layers. Herein, a novel dual diversity space-time coding (DDSTC) is proposed to exploit the intrinsic UEP capability of space-time codes by utilizing a constellation mapping duo for two consecutive transmission periods in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. As compared with Alamouti coding, the DDSTC achieves coding gains on the transmission error rates of base layer without significant degradations on the enhancement layers. At the transmission rates of base and enhancement layers equal to 2 bits per transmission, the DDSTC obtains 1.3 dB and 3.0 dB coding gains for base layer in 2 \u00d7 2 and 2 \u00d7 3 MIMO systems respectively. Besides, analytical analysis on symbol error probabilities verifies that 6 dB asymptotic coding gain is reachable in rich transmit diversity scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic frequency and power allocation algorithm for the DownLink (DL) of OFDMA-based cellular networks, where frequency resources are allocated to cells by a central broker to minimize long-term cell-edge inter-cell interference. Moreover, each cell independently assigns its available frequency resources and power to users in a way that its total DL transmission power is minimized while meeting the throughput demands of its users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvements in network outage performance, capacity, and throughput as compared with existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6331703/06276215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331703","startPage":"2904","endPage":"2914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Downlink Frequency and Power Allocation in OFDMA Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Downlink Frequency and Power Allocation in OFDMA Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13056954","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6276215/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Downlink Frequency and Power Allocation in OFDMA Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"2904-tc1210-perez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088357S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6331703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6331703","articleId":"6276215","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6276216,"authors":[{"name":"Lotfollah Beygi","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6362326/6276216/6276216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lotfollah Beygi received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree both in electrical engineering in 1999 and 2002, respectively, from University of Tehran, Iran.

According to this model, for high enough symbol rates, a fiber-optic link can be described as a linear dispersive channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and a complex scaling. The variance of this AWGN noise and the attenuation are computed analytically as a function of input power and channel parameters. The results illustrate a cubic growth of the noise variance with input power. Moreover, the cross effect between the two polarizations and the interaction of amplifier noise and the transmitted signal due to the nonlinear Kerr effect are described. In particular, it is found that the channel noise variance in one polarization is affected twice as much by the transmitted power in that polarization than by the transmitted power in the orthogonal polarization. The effect of pulse shaping is also investigated through numerical simulations. Finally, it is shown that the analytical performance results based on the new model are in close agreement with numerical results obtained using the SSFM for a symbol rate of 28 Gbaud and above.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06276216.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","startPage":"3440","endPage":"3450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discrete-Time Model for Uncompensated Single-Channel Fiber-Optical Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Discrete-Time Model for Uncompensated Single-Channel Fiber-Optical Links","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148514","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6276216/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discrete-Time Model for Uncompensated Single-Channel Fiber-Optical Links","sourcePdf":"3440-tc1211-beygi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116069S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6276216","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6276217,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The additive noise is modeled by a symmetric alpha-stable distribution, a well-known model of man-made and natural noise that appears in various environments. A major challenge in the design of signal detection schemes is that detectors typically operate without knowledge of the transmitted data, channel state, and noise statistics. The design becomes especially difficult for the considered noise model since conventional signal processing approaches are not applicable. For this reason, we propose a five-stage signal detection scheme that is based on the use of a matched myriad filter. An important contribution of this paper is the development of new algorithms for the estimation of noise distribution parameters in the presence of an unknown signal. Results are presented which show that the proposed detector outperforms a zero-memory non-linearity-based scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Digital Amplitude-Phase Modulated Signals in Symmetric Alpha-Stable Noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.120026","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06276217.pdf","startPage":"3365","endPage":"3375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.120026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Digital Amplitude-Phase Modulated Signals in Symmetric Alpha-Stable Noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6276217/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148515","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Digital Amplitude-Phase Modulated Signals in Symmetric Alpha-Stable Noise","sourcePdf":"3365-tc1211-chavali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135171S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6276217","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6276222,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Zhu","affiliation":["NICTA Ltd., University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic., Australia"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38237594900"},{"name":"An V.

We analyze the diurnal variation of rainfall rate for four time intervals and, moreover, we present statistics of rain attenuation for slant-path Earth-space links estimated by means of a new model (Stratiform-Convective SST) that combines the advantages of the Dual-Layer Synthetic Storm Technique (SST) and the SC EXCELL model. The predicted statistics are in good agreement with those obtained from beacon measurements (MEASAT-1 satellite at 12 GHz). Finally, the diurnal variation of the slant-path rain attenuation is presented to provide system operators and radio communication engineers with useful information on the quality of service (QoS) that can be achieved during a typical day on an Earth-space link.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06276225.pdf","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1005","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2214371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2214371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Rain Attenuation in Equatorial Kuala Lumpur","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Rain Attenuation in Equatorial Kuala Lumpur","htmlLink":"/document/6276225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2012","accessionNumber":"12956777","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Rain Attenuation in Equatorial Kuala Lumpur","sourcePdf":"lawp-din-2214371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055511S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6276225","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6276226,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Min Lee","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Min","lastName":"Lee","id":"38469715800"},{"name":"Ki-Baek Kim","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Baek","lastName":"Kim","id":"38469427400"},{"name":"Hong-Kyun Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Kyun","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37291322400"},{"name":"Jong-Myung Woo","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Myung","lastName":"Woo","id":"37274778200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6276226","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2806},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Ultra wideband antennas","Wireless LAN","Mobile antennas","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mobile handsets","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact ultrawideband MIMO antenna","WLAN band-rejected operation","mobile devices","compact ultrawideband multiple-input-multiple-output antenna","WCDMA band","WiMax band","UWB bands","printed folded monopole antenna","parasitic inverted-L element","frequency 1.92 GHz to 2.17 GHz","frequency 2.3 GHz to 2.5 GHz","frequency 5.15 GHz to 5.85 GHz","bandwidth 1.85 GHz to 11.9 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band-rejected antennas","mobile devices","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) antennas","wideband antennas"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents an ultrawideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna that covers the WCDMA (1.92-2.17 GHz), WiMAX (2.3, 2.5 GHz), WLAN (2.4 GHz), and UWB (3.1-10.6 GHz) bands for wireless device applications.

The receive chain consists of wideband LNA and mixer, baseband amplifiers, and a 7-bit 21 MS/s filtering SAR ADC. This filtering ADC embeds a highly-integrated and configurable DT FIR/IIR filter to replace dedicated filtering stages. The tap length and coefficients of the embedded FIR filter are configurable from 16 to 64 taps and 0 to 6 units, respectively. Interleaving of the SAR and DT filter sampling processes in the ADC maximizes the conversion rate and facilitates IIR filtering. The prototype receiver supports several standards and bands. In packet tests, the prototype exceeds the sensitivity and jammer resistance requirements of both the 915 MHz and 2450 MHz bands of IEEE 802.15.4 while consuming 4.0 mW and 5.5 mW, respectively. The receiver is also demonstrated with the DSSS specification of IEEE 802.11.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6359940/06276231.pdf","startPage":"2846","endPage":"2857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359940","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible 500 MHz to 3.6 GHz Wireless Receiver with Configurable DT FIR and IIR Filter Embedded in a 7b 21 MS/s SAR ADC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Finite impulse response filter","Receivers","Wireless communication","Baseband","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","filtering theory","FIR filters","IIR filters","radio receivers","signal sampling","software radio","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR ADC","flexible software-configurable wireless receiver","wideband LNA","mixer","baseband amplifiers","CMOS process","configurable DT FIR-IIR filter","tap length","embedded FIR filter","DT filter sampling process","jammer resistance","IEEE 802.15.4","IEEE 802.11","frequency 500 MHz to 3.6 GHz","word length 7 bit","power 4.0 mW","power 5.5 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog discrete-time filter","configurable filter","SAR ADC","wireless receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible 500 MHz to 3.6 GHz Wireless Receiver with Configurable DT FIR and IIR Filter Embedded in a 7b 21 MS/s SAR ADC","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6276231/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13146669","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible 500 MHz to 3.6 GHz Wireless Receiver with Configurable DT FIR and IIR Filter Embedded in a 7b 21 MS/s SAR ADC","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lin-2206457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075966S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6359940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6359940","articleId":"6276231","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6276232,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad S.

Toward that end, we have developed a transcutaneous two-way communication and power system for wireless neural recording. Wireless powering and forward data transmission (into the body) at 1.25 Mbps is achieved using a frequency-shift keying modulated class E converter. The reverse telemetry (out of the body) carrier frequency is generated using an integer-N phase-locked loop, providing the necessary wideband data link to support simultaneous reverse telemetry from multiple implanted devices on separate channels. Each channel is designed to support reverse telemetry with a data rate in excess of 3 Mbps, which is sufficient for our goal of streaming 16 channels of raw neural data. We plan to incorporate this implantable power and telemetry system in a 1-cm diameter single-site cortical neural recording implant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13055207","htmlLink":"/document/6276242/","pubMedId":"22922687","displayDocTitle":"A Power and Data Link for a Wireless-Implanted Neural Recording System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power and Data Link for a Wireless-Implanted Neural Recording System","sourcePdf":"tbme-pt2-rush-2214385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144772S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6331619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6331619","articleId":"6276242","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6276251,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ozgun Ok","affiliation":["Department of Geodetic and Geographic Information Technologies, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey","Department of Civil Engineering, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6469260/6276251/6276251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Ozgun Ok (M'12) received the B.S. degree from the Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey, in 2001 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently with the Department of Civil Engineering, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.

First, we investigate the shadow evidence to focus on building regions. To do that, we propose a new fuzzy landscape generation approach to model the directional spatial relationship between buildings and their shadows. Once all landscapes are collected, a pruning process is developed to eliminate the landscapes that may occur due to non-building objects. The final building regions are detected by GrabCut partitioning approach. In this paper, the input requirements of the GrabCut partitioning are automatically extracted from the previously determined shadow and landscape regions, so that the approach gained an efficient fully automated behavior for the detection of buildings. Extensive experiments performed on 20 test sites selected from a set of QuickBird and Geoeye-1 VHR images showed that the proposed approach accurately detects buildings with arbitrary shapes and sizes in complex environments. The tests also revealed that even under challenging environmental and illumination conditions, reasonable building detection performances could be achieved by the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2207123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6469260/06276251.pdf","startPage":"1701","endPage":"1717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2207123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Detection of Arbitrarily Shaped Buildings in Complex Environments From Monocular VHR Optical Satellite Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276251/","displayDocTitle":"Automated Detection of Arbitrarily Shaped Buildings in Complex Environments From Monocular VHR Optical Satellite Imagery","volume":"51","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13343323","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6276251/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Detection of Arbitrarily Shaped Buildings in Complex Environments From Monocular VHR Optical Satellite Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ok-2207123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148744S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6469260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6469260","articleId":"6276251","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6276254,"authors":[{"name":"Steven X.

So far investigations on irregular breathing patterns have been limited to respiratory monitoring of only extreme inspiration and expiration. Using breathing traces acquired on a Cyberknife treatment facility, we retrospectively categorized breathing data into several classes based on the extracted feature metrics derived from breathing data of multiple patients. The novelty of this paper is that the classifier using neural networks can provide clinical merit for the statistical quantitative modeling of irregular breathing motion based on a regular ratio representing how many regular/irregular patterns exist within an observation period. We propose a new approach to detect irregular breathing patterns using neural networks, where the reconstruction error can be used to build the distribution model for each breathing class. The proposed irregular breathing classification used a regular ratio to decide whether or not the current breathing patterns were regular. The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristiccurve of the proposed irregular breathing pattern detector was analyzed. The experimental results of 448 patients' breathing patterns validated the proposed irregular breathing classifier.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2012.2214395","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2012.2214395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/6353358/06276258.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irregular Breathing Classification From Multiple Patient Datasets Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276258/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Irregular Breathing Classification From Multiple Patient Datasets Using Neural Networks","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6276258/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13168236","pubMedId":"22922728","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Irregular Breathing Classification From Multiple Patient Datasets Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"titb-motai-2214395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121903S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6353358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6353358","articleId":"6276258","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6276259,"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Ostadabbas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/6353358/6276259/6276259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sarah Ostadabbas (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in both electrical and biomedical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in control engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, in 2007.

Patients need to be regularly repositioned to prevent excessive pressure on a single area of body, which can lead to ulcers. Pressure ulcers are extremely costly to treat and may lead to several other health problems, including death. The current standard for prevention is to reposition at-risk patients every 2 h. Even if it is done properly, a fixed schedule is not sufficient to prevent all ulcers. Moreover, it may result in nurses being overworked by turning some patients too frequently. In this paper, we present an algorithm for finding a nurse-effort optimal repositioning schedule that prevents pressure ulcer formation for a finite planning horizon.

Existing power distribution techniques tend to increase the number of cascaded conversion stages, which limits overall efficiency. Differential power processing enables independent load regulation, while processing only a small portion of the total load power. Bulk power conversion occurs once. Load voltage domains are connected in series, and differential converters act as controllable current sources to regulate intermediate nodes. This enables independent, low supply voltages, which can reduce system energy consumption, especially in digital circuits and solid-state lighting. Since differential voltage regulators process a fraction of the load power, decreased size, cost, and conversion losses are attainable. Under balanced load conditions, secondary differential converters do not process any power. This paper analyzes several differential power delivery architectures that can be applied to homogenous and heterogeneous loads at various levels: chip, board, blade, etc. A variety of operating conditions for a test system with four series voltage domains are examined in simulation and verified with experimental hardware. Results in a reference application show a 7\u20138% decrease in input power and 6\u20137 percentage points increase in overall conversion efficiency as compared to a conventional cascaded approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Power Processing for DC Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2214402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6341145/06276262.pdf","startPage":"1795","endPage":"1806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2214402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Differential Power Processing for DC Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6276262/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Power Processing for DC Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-shenoy-2214402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062736S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6341145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6341145","articleId":"6276262","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6276263,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Fei Wang","affiliation":["ATCO Electric, Canadian Utilities, Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6361328/6276263/6276263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Fei Wang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912) was born in Lanzhou, China, in 1983.

Since only one signal is available, the task is more difficult than in three-phase systems. Among the existing methods, the frequency-domain ones are known to have a one-cycle delay and heavier computational burden. Meanwhile, the time-domain methods often rely on phase-locked loop, quadrature signal generation, and complex filtering techniques; the resulted multiple-looped system may suffer from slow transients and stability issues. This paper proposes a new detection method based on anticonjugate harmonic decomposition and cascaded delayed signal cancellation. The method uses constant zero as the quadrature signal, and has a completely open-looped structure. The resulted detection system is very simple and robust. The fundamental and harmonic detection transients can be as short as 0.47 cycle in most cases, or 1.5 cycles for cases with considerable frequency variations. Meanwhile, zero steady-state error can be guaranteed in complicated harmonic scenarios, including all typical single-phase system harmonics.

In the new defined transform domain, the channel parameters of the two block pilots in the SC-FDMA subframe are first estimated, then the polynomial basis expansion model (P-BEM) is employed to estimate the channel parameters of the data symbols, and an autoregressive (AR) model is used to improve the estimation accuracy of the channel parameters of the data symbols out of the two block pilots. The symbol-by-symbol changes of the channel parameters can be effectively estimated by the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to the fast time-varying channel in the HST scenario, and that the frame error rate (FER) performance of the system by using the proposed method can obtain a gain in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 10 dB compared with those of the available methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2214409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353156","startPage":"4009","endPage":"4019","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6353156/06276270.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2214409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Time-Varying Channel Estimation Technique for LTE Uplink in HST Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Time-varying channels","Data models","Indexes","Rician channels","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","channel estimation","frequency division multiplexing","Long Term Evolution","polynomials","railway communication","time division multiple access","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast time-varying channel estimation technique","LTE uplink","HST environment","time-division duplex long term evolution","single carrier frequency division multiple access system","SC-FDMA system","high speed train environment","defined transform domain","channel parameters","polynomial basis expansion model","data symbols","autoregressive model","frame error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","high-speed train (HST)","single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA)","transform domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast Time-Varying Channel Estimation Technique for LTE Uplink in HST Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6276270/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13115790","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Time-Varying Channel Estimation Technique for LTE Uplink in HST Environment","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2214409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067085S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6353156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6353156","articleId":"6276270","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6276271,"authors":[{"name":"Yuli Yang","affiliation":["King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6353156/6276271/6276271-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuli Yang (S'04\u2013M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2007.","From 2006 to 2007, she was an Intern with Huawei Technologies, and from 2007 to 2009, she was a Research Scientist with Alcatel\u2013Lucent Shanghai Bell Labs.

To achieve high spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining a target packet loss probability (PLP), switching among different transmission modes is performed to match the time-varying propagation conditions pertaining to the secondary link. Herein, by minimizing the SU's packet error rate (PER) with each transmission mode subject to the spectrum-sharing constraints, we obtain the optimal power allocation at the secondary transmitter (ST) and then derive the probability density function (pdf) of the received SNR at the secondary receiver (SR). Based on these statistics, the SU's packet loss rate and average SE are obtained in closed form, considering transmissions over block-fading channels with different distributions. Our results quantify the relation between the performance of a secondary link exploiting the cross-layer-designed adaptive transmission and the interference inflicted on the primary user (PU) in CR networks.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2214410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6353156/06276271.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2214410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"4020","endPage":"4030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Combining of Adaptive Modulation and Truncated ARQ Under Cognitive Radio Resource Requirements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6276271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Combining of Adaptive Modulation and Truncated ARQ Under Cognitive Radio Resource Requirements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6276271/","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6276271/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13115791","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Combining of Adaptive Modulation and Truncated ARQ Under Cognitive Radio Resource Requirements","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2214410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060522S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6353156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6353156","articleId":"6276271","onlineDate":"21 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6276305,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhao","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory/DIMES, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6276273/6276305/6276305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Zhao (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 2008.

The tilt-tip control makes two separate laser beams overlap with each other in the far field, while the phase-locking control compensates the piston phase differences between the fiber lasers. Normalized power in bucket increases from 0.27 in open loop to 0.99 in closed loop. The fringe contrast is improved from 0% to more than 97% correspondingly.

The system consists of an implantable, batteryless and wireless transponder with integrated impedance and pH sensors; and a wearable, external reader that wirelessly powers up the transponder and interprets the transponded radio-frequency signals. The transponder implant with the total size of 0.4 cm \u00d70.8 cm \u00d73.8 cm harvests radio frequency energy to operate dual-sensor and load-modulation circuitry. The external reader can store the data in a memory card and/or send it to a base station wirelessly, which is optional in the case of multiple-patient monitoring in a hospital or conducting large-scale freely behaving animal experiments. Tests were carried out to verify the signal transduction reliability in different situations for antenna locations and orientation. In vitro, experiments were conducted in a mannequin model by positioning the sensor capsule inside the wall of a tube mimicking the esophagus. Different liquids with known pH values were flushed through the tube creating reflux episodes and wireless signals were recorded. Live pigs under anesthesia were used for the animal models with the transponder implant attached on the esophageal wall. The reflux episodes were created while the sensor data were recorded wirelessly. The data were compared with those recorded independently by a clinically used wireless pH sensor capsule placed next to our implant transponder. The results showed that our transponder detected every episode in both acid and non-acid nature, while the commercial pH sensor missed events that had similar, repeated pH values, and failed to detect pH values higher than 10. Our batteryless transponder does not require a battery thus allowing longer diagnosis and prognosis periods to monitor drug efficacy, as well as providing accurate assessment of GERD symptoms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6331619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6331619/06279457.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2214773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2214773","startPage":"3131","endPage":"3139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Implantable, Batteryless, and Wireless Capsule With Integrated Impedance and pH Sensors for Gastroesophageal Reflux Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279457/","displayDocTitle":"An Implantable, Batteryless, and Wireless Capsule With Integrated Impedance and pH Sensors for Gastroesophageal Reflux Monitoring","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6279457/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"13055208","pubMedId":"22922690","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Implantable, Batteryless, and Wireless Capsule With Integrated Impedance and pH Sensors for Gastroesophageal Reflux Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tbme-pt2-cao-2214773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097509S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6331619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6331619","articleId":"6279457","onlineDate":"22 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6279462,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Soundararajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6491457/6279462/6279462-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rajiv Soundararajan received the B.E.

The spatial and temporal information differences are combined to obtain the spatio-temporal-reduced reference entropic differences. The algorithms are flexible in terms of the amount of side information required from the reference that can range between a single scalar per frame and the entire reference information.

systems and its corresponding hardware co-simulation platform. This pilot-aided channel estimation algorithm consists of two parts: coarse estimation and fine estimation. In the coarse estimation, the combined classical channel estimation methods including carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel impulse response (CIR) estimation are used. Based on the received training sequence and pilot tones in the frequency domain, the major CFO, sampling clock frequency offset (SFO) and CIR effect coefficients are derived. In the fine estimation, the pilot-aided polynomial interpolation estimation combined with a new decision feedback equalizer scheme based on minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criteria is proposed to reduce the residual effect caused by imperfect CIR equalizer, SFO and CFO. At the same time, for the purpose of speeding up the whole development and verification process, a new architecture of co-simulation platform which combines software and hardware is introduced. The simulation results on the co-simulation platform indicate that the proposed hybrid channel estimation scheme can enhance the receiver performance by 6 dB in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM) over large ranges of CFO and SFO and BER performance by 7 dB for SNR range over 15 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2012.2207249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/6351840/06279474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2012.2207249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6351840","startPage":"590","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and Co-Simulation of Hybrid Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation With Decision Feedback Equalizer for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6279474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and Co-Simulation of Hybrid Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation With Decision Feedback Equalizer for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279474/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136049","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and Co-Simulation of Hybrid Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation With Decision Feedback Equalizer for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-li-2207249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056294S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6351840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6279474","onlineDate":"22 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6279477,"authors":[{"name":"Sanghyun Woo","affiliation":["Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6314489/6279477/6279477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanghyun Woo (S'07\u2013M'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2010.","From 2000 to 2006, he was with the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin-Si, Korea, as a Member of Research Staff, where he was involved with 4G wireless communication systems.

Unlike existing microgrids which are purely ac, the hybrid microgrid studied here comprises dc and ac subgrids interconnected by power electronic interfaces. The main challenge here is to manage power flows among all sources distributed throughout the two types of subgrids, which is certainly tougher than previous efforts developed for only ac or dc microgrid. This wider scope of control has not yet been investigated, and would certainly rely on the coordinated operation of dc sources, ac sources, and interlinking converters. Suitable control and normalization schemes are now developed for controlling them with the overall hybrid microgrid performance already verified in simulation and experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"28","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13146878","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6279488/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Operation of Hybrid Microgrid With AC and DC Subgrids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Operation of Hybrid Microgrid With AC and DC Subgrids","sourcePdf":"tpel-loh-2214792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081841S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"439","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6279488","onlineDate":"22 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6279494,"authors":[{"name":"Yicong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6479286/6279494/6279494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yicong Zhou (M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Tufts University, Medford, MA.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Macau, Macau, China.

A narrowband model representing an OFDM subcarrier is used to analyze the performance of several diversity combining schemes including optimum combining (OC), saturated metric combining (SMC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC). Results from BER analysis show that SMC achieves good performance in highly impulsive noise and is relatively insensitive to error in noise parameter estimates. Indoor measurements from 3 detached homes show that parallel wireless and PLC channels have a wide, but similar, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. Measurement data is used with link throughput analysis to show that wireless/PLC diversity can be used to minimize the likelihood of low throughput links.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081512.110408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6389884/06279521.pdf","startPage":"3865","endPage":"3875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081512.110408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Wireless and PLC Channels for Diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Using the Wireless and PLC Channels for Diversity","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6279521/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188467","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Wireless and PLC Channels for Diversity","sourcePdf":"3865-tc1212-lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07638S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6389884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6389884","articleId":"6279521","onlineDate":"22 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6279523,"authors":[{"name":"Don Torrieri","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6362326/6279523/6279523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Don Torrieri is a research engineer and Fellow of the US Army Research Laboratory.

The mobile locations may be drawn from any spatial distribution, and interference-avoidance protocols or protection against physical collisions among the mobiles may be modeled by placing an exclusion zone around each radio. The channel model accounts for the path loss, Nakagami fading, and shadowing of each received signal. The Nakagami m-parameter can vary among the mobiles, taking any positive value for each of the interference signals and any positive integer value for the desired signal. The analysis is governed by a new exact expression for the outage probability, defined to be the probability that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) drops below a threshold, and is conditioned on the network geometry and shadowing factors, which have dynamics over much slower timescales than the fading. By averaging over many network and shadowing realizations, the average outage probability and transmission capacity are computed. Using the analysis, many aspects of the network performance are illuminated. For example, one can determine the influence of the choice of spreading factors, the effect of the receiver location within the finite network region, and the impact of both the fading parameters and the attenuation power laws.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6362326/06279523.pdf","startPage":"3509","endPage":"3518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081512.110530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081512.110530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6279523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Outage Probability of a Finite Ad Hoc Network in Nakagami Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Fading","Shadow mapping","Receivers","Interference","Mobile computing","Nakagami distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel capacity","interference suppression","Nakagami channels","probability","protocols","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","finite ad hoc network","Nakagami fading channel","path loss","received signal","Nakagami m-parameter","interference signals","signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio","SINR","network geometry","shadowing factors","transmission capacity","finite network region","attenuation power laws"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","transmission capacity","Nakagami fading","spread spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Outage Probability of a Finite Ad Hoc Network in Nakagami Fading","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6279523/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13148520","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Outage Probability of a Finite Ad Hoc Network in Nakagami Fading","sourcePdf":"3509-tc1211-torrieri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076138S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6362326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6362326","articleId":"6279523","onlineDate":"22 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6279525,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Trifonov","affiliation":["Distributed Computing and Networking Department, Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University, Saint-Petersburg, Russia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6362326/6279525/6279525-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Trifonov was born in St. Petersburg, USSR in 1980.

While smart grid integration enables power grid networks to be smarter, it also increases the risk of cyberattacks due to the strong dependence on the cyberinfrastructure in the overall system. In this article, the coordinated datainjection attack detection problem in the smart grid is considered. Specifically, the data-injection attack model is first introduced and a thorough survey of existing detection methods is then given. Afterward, three important efforts to enrich the detection solution are presented in detail: 1) attacker versus defender dynamics, where possible interactive attack and defense strategies are discussed in the context of secure phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement 2) distributed attack detection and state recovery, where the focus is how to achieve the optimal centralized performance with a distributed approach 3) quickest detection (QD), where the trade off between the detection speed and detection performance is studied. A list of associated key open problems in this area is then presented to conclude this article.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated data-injection attack and detection in the smart grid: A detailed look at enriching detection solutions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2012.2185911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/6279563/06279584.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2185911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6279563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6279584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated data-injection attack and detection in the smart grid: A detailed look at enriching detection solutions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6279584/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933665","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated data-injection attack and detection in the smart grid: A detailed look at enriching detection solutions","sourcePdf":"29msp05-cui-2185911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07306S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6279563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6279563","articleId":"6279584","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"ISTOCKPHOTO.COM\u00a9 SIGAL SUHLER MORANIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6279585,"authors":[{"name":"Ramsey Faragher","affiliation":["Systems Advanced Technology Centre, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Ramsey Faragher (ramsey@cantab.net) is a principal scientist at the BAE Systems Advanced Technology Centre, United Kingdom."]},"firstName":"Ramsey","lastName":"Faragher","id":"38261713300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"6279585","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":246,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":15547},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Mathematics","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","Kalman filters","teaching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filter","intuitive derivation","teaching","Gaussian functions","mathematics"]}],"abstract":"This article provides a simple and intuitive derivation of the Kalman filter, with the aim of teaching this useful tool to students from disciplines that do not require a strong mathematical background.

This monitoring and control requires low-delay, highly reliable communication between customers, local utilities, and regional utilities. A vital part of future smart grids is the two way communication links between smart meters at the customer sites and a (decentralized) command and control center operated by the local utility. To enable these two-way communication links, narrowband power line communication (PLC) systems operating in the 3-500 kHz band are attractive because they can be deployed over existing outdoor power lines. Power lines, however, have traditionally been designed for one-directional power delivery and remain hostile environments for communication signal propagation. In this article, we review signal processing approaches to model channel impairments and impulsive noise and mitigate their effects in narrowband PLC systems. We examine ways to improve the communication performance based on current and emerging standards.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/6279563/06279590.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2012.2187038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2187038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6279563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6279590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Utility Power Line Communications in the 3\u2013500 kHz Band: Channel Impairments, Noise, and Standards","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Power grids","Power system management","Noise measurement","Standards","Electricity supply industry","Channel capacity","Power transmission lines","Power overhead lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","impulse noise","signal processing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local utility power line communications","channel impairments","channel noise","channel standards","smart grid systems","energy flows","power delivery reliability","power delivery efficiency","local utilities","regional utilities","two way communication links","smart meters","customer sites","decentralized command","control center","narrowband PLC systems","outdoor power lines","one-directional power delivery","communication signal propagation","signal processing approaches","impulsive noise","frequency 3 kHz to 500 kHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Local Utility Power Line Communications in the 3\u2013500 kHz Band: Channel Impairments, Noise, and Standards","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6279590/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933669","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Utility Power Line Communications in the 3\u2013500 kHz Band: Channel Impairments, Noise, and Standards","sourcePdf":"29msp05-nassar-2187038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102909S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6279563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6279563","articleId":"6279590","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6279592,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, US"],"bio":{"p":["Walid Saad (walid@miami.edu) received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Lebanese University in 2004, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Oslo, Norway, in 2010.

To accommodate these technologies, it will have to build on solid mathematical tools that can ensure an efficient and robust operation of such heterogeneous and large-scale cyberphysical systems. In this context, this article is an overview on the potential of applying game theory for addressing relevant and timely open problems in three emerging areas that pertain to the smart grid: microgrid systems, demand-side management, and communications. In each area, the state-of-the-art contributions are gathered and a systematic treatment, using game theory, of some of the most relevant problems for future power systems is provided. Future opportunities for adopting game-theoretic methodologies in the transition from legacy systems toward smart and intelligent grids are also discussed.

In this article, we introduce a unified framework for the estimation of instantaneous frequency in both balanced and unbalanced conditions in a three-phase system, thus consolidating the existing approaches and providing next-generation solutions capable of joint adaptive frequency estimation and system fault identification. This is achieved by employing recent developments in the statistics of complex variables (augmented statistics) and the associated widely linear models, allowing us to benefit from a rigorous account of varying degrees of noncircularity corresponding to different sources of frequency variations. The advantages of such an approach are illustrated for both balanced and unbalanced conditions, including voltage sags, harmonics and supply-demand mismatch, all major obstacles for accurate frequency estimation in the smart grid.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/6279563/06279596.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2012.2183689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2183689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6279563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6279596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Frequency Estimation in Smart Grid Applications: Exploiting Noncircularity and Widely Linear Adaptive Estimators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Power system management","Frequency estimation","Estimation","Time frequency analysis","Network topology","Power system management","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","frequency estimation","power supply quality","real-time systems","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart grid","adaptive frequency estimation","noncircularity","widely linear adaptive estimators","system frequency estimation","real time","instantaneous frequency estimation","unbalanced conditions","three-phase system","next-generation solutions","system fault identification","complex variables statistics","augmented statistics","frequency variations","voltage sags","harmonics","supply-demand mismatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6279596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Frequency Estimation in Smart Grid Applications: Exploiting Noncircularity and Widely Linear Adaptive Estimators","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6279596/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12933675","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Frequency Estimation in Smart Grid Applications: Exploiting Noncircularity and Widely Linear Adaptive Estimators","sourcePdf":"29msp05-xia-2183689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056661S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6279563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6279563","articleId":"6279596","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"ISTOCKPHOTO.COM/\u00a9 SIGAL SUHLER MORANIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"}]
