Discrete variable delays are obtained by exploiting an optically controlled fiber loop. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are used as switching gates in order to store or route the packet to the buffer output. Cross gain modulation effect is responsible for SOA-based switching, thus allowing for polarization and wavelength independent operation in the whole C-band. A maximum storage time of 50 \u03bcs is demonstrated without significant signal degradation. Performances are evaluated in terms of bit error rate measurements for 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero data payload, providing an optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty lower than 3 dB after 10 rounds. Cross talk measurements confirm the scheme suitability for OPS applications. The proposed solution is particularly attractive in slotted OPS nodes architectures where packet contention would be managed entirely in the optical domain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical buffering","Optical packet switching","Adaptive optics","Optical switches","Optical polarization","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","error statistics","optical communication equipment","optical crosstalk","optical delay lines","optical fibre communication","optical fibre polarisation","optical modulation","optical switches","packet switching","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-optical variable buffer","semiconductor optical amplifier","packet buffering","optical packet switching","discrete variable delays","optically controlled fiber loop","switching gates","cross gain modulation effect","polarization","wavelength independent operation","bit error rate","nonreturn-to-zero data payload","cross talk","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buffer memories","delay system","gain control","packet switching","semiconductor optical amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JQE.2010.2092752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/5724796/05730169.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5724796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2010.2092752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Variable Buffer Based on Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Variable Buffer Based on Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730169/","volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730169/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11872915","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Variable Buffer Based on Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","sourcePdf":"jqe-berrettini-2092752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068325S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5724796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5724796","articleId":"5730169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730170,"authors":[{"name":"Giampiero Contestabile","affiliation":["Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan","Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/5724796/5730170/5730170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giampiero Contestabile received the Laurea degree in physics from La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and telecommunications from Tor Vergata University, Rome, in 2001.","He was with the Semiconductor Devices Group of \u201cFondazione Ugo Bordoni,\u201d Rome, from 1996 to 2000.

This linear transceiver ensures that the required quality of service (QoS) is achieved at each user while satisfying the interference constraints on the primary users. Here, certain predefined throughput is considered as a QoS requirement for each user. The original QoS based transceiver design in the downlink is solved by exploiting the stream-wise mean-square error (MSE) duality and based on alternating optimization framework between the uplink and the downlink. From the MSE duality, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain transceiver filters. In each iteration, the downlink receiver filters are designed based on minimum mean square errors (MMSEs). The virtual uplink receiver filters are designed by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which incorporates the interference constraints on the primary users. The power allocation problem in the virtual uplink is solved using a geometric programming (GP), where the required total transmit power is minimized to satisfy the required rate constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through the simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Cognitive Radio (IWCR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724310/5730213/05730215.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Cognitive Radio (IWCR)","doi":"10.1109/IWCR.2010.5730215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCR.2010.5730215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear transceiver design for multiuser spectrum sharing MIMO networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","MIMO","Receivers","Interference constraints","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","geometric programming","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","quadratic programming","quality of service","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear transceiver design","multiuser spectrum sharing MIMO networks","multiple-input-multiple-output networks","quality of service","QoS requirement","interference constraints","primary users","stream-wise mean-square error duality","alternating optimization framework","MSE duality","iterative algorithm","transceiver filters","downlink receiver filters","minimum mean square errors","virtual uplink receiver filters","quadratically constrained quadratic programming","geometric programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Linear transceiver design for multiuser spectrum sharing MIMO networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11874338","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","conferenceDate":"15-15 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear transceiver design for multiuser spectrum sharing MIMO networks","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"Lambo21569371167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039461S","chronDate":"15-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724310","isNumber":"5730213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724310","xplore-issue":"5730213","articleId":"5730215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5730216,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Xin Hu","affiliation":["National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan","Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming-Xin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37854892300"},{"name":"Geng-Sheng Kuo","affiliation":["National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan","Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Geng-Sheng","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37868277300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9100-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9099-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9098-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5730216","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Switches","Sensors","Real time systems","Quality of service","Cognitive radio","Distance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cognitive radio","metropolitan area networks","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio-enabled QoS-enhanced scheme","IEEE 802.16e network","incremental bandwidth","primary user","secondary user","adaptive bandwidth reservation mechanism","switch mechanism","connection dropping probability","connection blocking probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","IEEE 802.16e","QoS"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio-enabled QoS-enhanced scheme for IEEE 802.16e networks","doi":"10.1109/IWCR.2010.5730216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730213","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Cognitive Radio (IWCR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Cognitive Radio (IWCR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724310/5730213/05730216.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCR.2010.5730216","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730216","abstract":"The IEEE 802.16e network faces the challenge of bandwidth shortage due to the growing demand for high-bandwidth applications. One promising approach is to obtain bandwidth by using cognitive radio (CR) technology, which provides an effective way to achieve incremental bandwidth from unlicensed spectrum. However, the appearance of primary users (PUs) does harm to the performance of secondary users (SUs). In this paper, we propose a QoS-enhanced scheme to prevent real-time services in 802.16e networks from corruption when switching between licensed and unlicensed bands. Adaptive bandwidth reservation mechanism and simplified switch mechanism are proposed to improve QoS performance for 802.16e services. Finally, simulation results show that our scheme has lower connection dropping probability (CDP) at a reasonable cost of connection blocking probability (CBP) than conventional scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874339","htmlLink":"/document/5730216/","conferenceDate":"15-15 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio-enabled QoS-enhanced scheme for IEEE 802.16e networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio-enabled QoS-enhanced scheme for IEEE 802.16e networks","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"Ming1569371136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094167S","chronDate":"15-15 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724310","isNumber":"5730213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724310","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5730213","articleId":"5730216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5730218,"authors":[{"name":"Samrat L.

We have also extended single node sensing to cooperative sensing using AND, OR and equal gain combining (EGC) fusion rule with energy detection technique in each node. We also implemented the cooperative sensing technique in Xilinx Vertex-2pro XC2VP30 (FFG896-7C) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

The computational complexity of finding an optimal JSUS-QPC scheme by exhaustive search grows exponentially with the number of users and power levels. In this paper, we present two low-complexity algorithms for JSUS-QPC in the cognitive MIMO system.

The conventional method for medical resonance brain images classification and tumors detection is by human inspection. Operator-assisted classification methods are impractical for large amounts of data and are also non-reproducible. Medical Resonance images contain a noise caused by operator performance which can lead to serious inaccuracies classification. The use of artificial intelligent techniques for instant, neural networks, and fuzzy logic shown great potential in this field. Hence, in this paper the Probabilistic Neural Network was applied for the purposes. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction using the principal component analysis and the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). The performance of the PNN classifier was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies. Probabilistic Neural Network gives fast and accurate classification and is a promising tool for classification of the tumors.","doi":"10.1109/ISMS.2011.32","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729958/5730309/05730335.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"138","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMS.2011.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Neural Network for Brain Tumor Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Neural Network for Brain Tumor Classification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11874427","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5730335/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Neural Network for Brain Tumor Classification","confLoc":"Phnom Penh, Cambodia","sourcePdf":"4336a136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052979S","chronDate":"25-27 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729958","isNumber":"5730309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729958","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5730309","articleId":"5730335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5730360,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Kattan","affiliation":["School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kattan","id":"37402116100"},{"name":"Rosni Abdullah","affiliation":["School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rosni","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"37281593100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0662"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-0670"}],"articleNumber":"5730360","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730360","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Benchmark testing","Program processors","Artificial neural networks","Computers","Training data","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel processing","pattern classification","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised training","feedforward artificial neural networks","harmony search algorithm","pattern classification benchmarking problem","parallel training method","pattern partitioning","network partitioning","master-slave parallel system","cluster computer","homogeneous system","switched network","distributed training method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","harmony search","parallel & distributed processing","pattern-classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISMS.2011.49","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729958/5730309/05730360.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation","startPage":"277","endPage":"283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMS.2011.49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel & Distributed Implementation of the Harmony Search Based Supervised Training of Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"The authors have published earlier a novel technique for the supervised training of feed-forward artificial neural networks using the Harmony Search algorithm.

Signal selection is based on the maximum gain of the source-relay link. Using the moment generating function (MGF) technique, the total signal to noise ratio (SNR) over the source-relay link and the average BER with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) are derived. Our formulation is applicable to cooperative links with any number of relay paths.

The relationship between EQ and project success is moderated by complexity of faith. The relationship between MQ and project success is moderated by complexity of fact and faith. Complexity of interaction has a direct effect on project success.

However, LCIs are known to generate interharmonics. They can interact with the mechanical system at torsional natural frequencies of the rotating train, on both the inverter and rectifier sides in weakly connected power systems, such as offshore oil and gas platforms. These interactions can lead to accelerated shaft fatigue, lifetime reduction, gear damage, and system blackouts. On the other hand, pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) voltage-source inverters (VSIs) are known to produce less torque ripple compared to LCIs. Consequently, VSIs are supposed to be less subject to exciting torsional resonances in mechanical shaft systems. Even with reduced torque ripple, mechanical failures have been consistently reported due to motor air-gap torques supplied by PWM drives. This paper is focused on solving torsional vibration issues. Due to system uncertainties, these issues cannot be excluded in the design phase of LCIs and VSIs for high-power applications. With regard to LCIs, the dc-link inductance is used as an integrated energy-storage unit. Motor and generator interactions are therefore decoupled. Excited eigenmodes on the grid side are damped with the rectifier; the inverter is driving the variable-speed motor. This approach is also successfully applied to damping resonance modes in the motor side.

The disturbance is detected by comparing the transformed signal with an empirically given threshold. However, as the signal under analysis contains noises, especially the white noise with flat spectrum, the threshold is difficult to give. Due to the nature of the flat spectrum, a filter cannot just get rid of the noise without removing the significant disturbance signals together. To enhance the WT technique in processing the noise-riding signals, this paper proposes a noise-suppression algorithm. The abilities of the WT in detecting and localizing the disturbances can hence be restored. Finally, this paper employed the actual data obtained from the practical power systems of Taiwan Power Company to test the effectiveness of the developed noise-suppression method.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2115610","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5765517/05730494.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2115610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising Techniques With a Spatial Noise-Suppression Method for Wavelet-Based Power Quality Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Noise","Transient analysis","Monitoring","Time frequency analysis","Voltage fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric noise measurement","power supply quality","power system measurement","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["denoising techniques","spatial noise-suppression method","wavelet-based power quality monitoring","wavelet transform technique","flat spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise measurement","power quality","power system measurement","power system monitoring","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Denoising Techniques With a Spatial Noise-Suppression Method for Wavelet-Based Power Quality Monitoring","volume":"60","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5730494/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11976058","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising Techniques With a Spatial Noise-Suppression Method for Wavelet-Based Power Quality Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tim-liao-2115610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065891S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5765517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5765517","articleId":"5730494","onlineDate":"14 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5730500,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6030134/5730500/5730500-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Sun received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering all from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.","In 2006, he joined the Faculty of Tsinghua University as a Lecturer of Electrical Engineering.

A distributed control strategy based on improved dc bus signaling is proposed for a modular photovoltaic (PV) generation system with battery energy storage elements. In this paper, the modular PV generation system is composed of three modular dc/dc converters for PV arrays, two grid-connected dc/ac converters, and one dc/dc converter for battery charging/discharging and local loads, which is available of either grid-connected operation or islanding operation. By using the proposed control strategy, the operations of a modular PV generation system are categorized into four modes: islanding with battery discharging, grid-connected rectification, grid-connected inversion, and islanding with constant voltage (CV) generation. The power balance of the system under extreme conditions such as the islanding operation with a full-charged battery is taken into account in this control strategy. The dc bus voltage level is employed as an information carrier to distinguish different modes and determine mode switching. Control methods of modular dc/dc converters, battery converter, and grid-connected converter are addressed. An autonomous control method for modular dc/dc converters is proposed to realize smooth switching between CV operation and maximum power point tracking operation, which enables the dc bus voltage regulation capability of modular dc/dc converters. Seamless switching of a battery converter between charging and discharging and that of a grid-connected converter between rectification and inversion are ensured by the proposed control methods. Experiments verify the practical feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"26","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12286573","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5730500/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Control Strategy Based on DC Bus Signaling for Modular Photovoltaic Generation Systems With Battery Energy Storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Control Strategy Based on DC Bus Signaling for Modular Photovoltaic Generation Systems With Battery Energy Storage","sourcePdf":"tpel-sun-2127488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075536S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6030134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"440","xplore-issue":"6030134","articleId":"5730500","onlineDate":"14 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5730501,"authors":[{"name":"Foroohar Foroozan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Oshawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5767741/5730501/5730501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Foroohar Foroozan (S'06) received the B.S. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995, the M.Sc. degree from Tehran Polytechnic, Iran, in 1998, respectively, both in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from York University, Toronto, Canada, in 2011.","From 1998 to 2005, she was working as a Senior Research Engineer in Sharif Advanced Information and Communication Technology Center, Tehran, Iran, and also in semiconductor industry working on data communication chip design.

Most radar systems are designed under the line-of-sight (LOS) assumption with multipath echos treated as undesired clutter noise. Strong multipath, therefore, has a negative impact on the resolution of the radar systems and their ability in accurately localizing the target. Rather than treating multipath as a detrimental effect, the paper introduces time reversal (TR) to exploit spatial/multipath diversity in improving the capability of the existing localization algorithms. In particular, we design TR based range and DOA estimators that adaptively adjust the probing radar waveforms to the multipath characteristics of the environment. The benefits of the spatial/multipath diversity in the proposed DOA and range estimators are quantified by deriving the respective Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds (CRB) and comparing them with the analytical expressions for their conventional counterparts. Numerical simulations also confirm the benefit of applying TR to source localization algorithms especially at low signal-to-noise ratios below -5 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2128317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5767741/05730501.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2128317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767741","startPage":"2655","endPage":"2668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Reversal Based Active Array Source Localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time Reversal Based Active Array Source Localization","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12006312","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5730501/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Reversal Based Active Array Source Localization","sourcePdf":"tsp-asif-2128317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107854S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5767741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5767741","articleId":"5730501","onlineDate":"14 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730505,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald P.

Knowledge of parameters such as clutter rate and detection profile are of critical importance in multi-target filters such as the probability hypothesis density (PHD) and cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filters. Significant mismatches in clutter and detection model parameters result in biased estimates. In practice, these model parameters are often manually tuned or estimated offline from training data. In this paper we propose PHD/CPHD filters that can accommodate model mismatch in clutter rate and detection profile.

It is assumed that the transmitted radio signal is random with known statistics. The conventional approach is based on two steps. In the first step the time difference of arrival and the differential Doppler shift are measured and in the second step these measurements are used for geolocation. We advocate a direct position determination approach that proves to be more computationally efficient and more precise for weak signals than the conventional approach. The direct method is a single-step method that uses the same signals as the two-step approach but searches directly for the emitter position without first estimating intermediate parameters such as Doppler frequency and the time delay. A secondary but important result is a derivation of closed-form and compact expressions of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound.

The use of ordinal optimization leads to a decrease in computational effort without compromising the quality of the solution. The benefits of the approach in terms of reduced estimation errors is illustrated by simulations involving a 95-bus UKGDS distribution network model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Current measurement","Optimization","State estimation","Power distribution","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","optimisation","power system state estimation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meter placement","distribution system state estimation","ordinal optimization approach","DSSE","relative errors","angle estimates","voltage magnitudes","probability","95-bus UKGDS distribution network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bivariate probability","distribution system state estimation","ordinal optimization","single quadrature"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2118771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6048014/05730515.pdf","startPage":"2328","endPage":"2335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2118771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meter Placement for Distribution System State Estimation: An Ordinal Optimization Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Meter Placement for Distribution System State Estimation: An Ordinal Optimization Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730515/","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730515/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12301708","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meter Placement for Distribution System State Estimation: An Ordinal Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-singh-2118771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077871S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6048014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6048014","articleId":"5730515","onlineDate":"14 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":5730522,"authors":[{"name":"Kerry Hinton","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Kerry Hinton (k.hinton@ee.unimelb.edu.au) received an Honors B.E. in 1978, an Honors B.Sc. in 1980, and an M.Sc. in mathematical sciences in 1982, all from the University of Adelaide.

To meet the ever increasing demands, the Internet has been rapidly growing, and it now includes a web of tens of millions of networked devices ranging from content servers to core and edge routers to home gateways. Due to the sheer numbers, however, it is reported that these devices, such as those used for content delivery, consume a considerable amount of energy. While optimizing the energy efficiency of data centers is well studied in the literature, understanding the energy efficiency of various content dissemination strategies has received comparatively little attention thus far. In this article we review existing content dissemination architectures and survey the energy efficiency of various network devices used for content delivery. The energy efficiency comparison using simple trace-based simulations reveals that a change from a host-oriented to a content-centric networking model can substantially improve energy efficiency of content dissemination. Our preliminary results are encouraging and will stimulate further research in this direction.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2011.5730523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/5730517/05730523.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2011.5730523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward energy-efficient content dissemination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730523/","displayDocTitle":"Toward energy-efficient content dissemination","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","accessionNumber":"11873176","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730523/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward energy-efficient content dissemination","sourcePdf":"006LEELAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033646S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5730517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5730517","articleId":"5730523","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5730524,"authors":[{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Skubic","affiliation":["Ericsson"],"bio":{"p":["Bjorn Skubic (bjorn.skubic@ericsson.com) holds a ph.D. in physics, condensed matter theory, from Uppsala University and an M.Sc. in engineering physics from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

One of the main opportunities for reducing network energy consumption lies in efficiency improvements of the customer premises equipment.

Current research indicates that one third of operating energy could be saved by reducing the transmission power of base stations. However, this approach requires the introduction of a range of additional equipment containing more embodied energy - consumed by all processes associated with the production of equipment. This problem is addressed first in this article. Furthermore, a new cellular network energy efficiency model with embodied energy is proposed, and optimization between the number of cells and their coverage is investigated. Contrary to previous works, we have found that embodied energy accounts for a significant proportion of total energy consumption and cannot be neglected. The simulation results confirm an important trade-off between operating and embodied energies, which can provide some practical guidelines for designing energy-efficient cellular access networks. The new model considering embodied energy is not limited to just cellular networks, but to other telecommunications, such as wireless local area networks and wired networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/5730517/05730527.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2011.5730527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2011.5730527","startPage":"40","endPage":"49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rethinking energy efficiency models of cellular networks with embodied energy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730527/","displayDocTitle":"Rethinking energy efficiency models of cellular networks with embodied energy","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730527/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11873180","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rethinking energy efficiency models of cellular networks with embodied energy","sourcePdf":"010GELAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061118S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5730517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"5730517","articleId":"5730527","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5730528,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00fcrkan G\u00fcr","affiliation":["Bogazici University, Turkey"],"bio":{"p":["Gurkan G\u00fcr (gurgurka@boun.edu.tr) received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2001 and M.S. degree in systems and control engineering in 2005, both from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.

There are two fundamental but entangled aspects of cognitive radios in the green communications context: leveraging CRs for energy efficiency and operation of CRs with energy efficiency. In practice, these two objectives overlap since the improvement of energy efficiency with CRs require efficient CRs, whereas efficient wireless communications require cognitive abilities at different network components and protocols. However, there are intrinsic challenges such as hardware complexity, algorithmic problems, and design trade-offs. In this article we present and discuss these issues to highlight the case of CRs for green wireless communication systems. Additionally, some fundamental trade-offs that emerge from these challenges and their impact on greening communications via cognitive functions are outlined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730528/","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5730528/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11873181","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Green wireless communications via cognitive dimension: an overview","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green wireless communications via cognitive dimension: an overview","sourcePdf":"011GRLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072767S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5730517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"5730517","articleId":"5730528","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5730552,"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Spence Adams","affiliation":["Franklin W.

These rate 1/2 codes are conjugation-separated and thus permit a linearized description of the transceiver signal. BCODs also display other combinatorial properties that are expected to be useful in implementation, such as having no linear processing. An elegant construction is provided for a class of rate 1/2 CODs that have no zero entries, effectively no irrational coefficients, no linear processing, and have each variable appearing exactly twice per column. The resulting codes meet the aforementioned bound on decoding delay in most cases. This class of CODs will be useful in practice due to their low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and other desirable properties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Classes of Minimal Delay and Low PAPR Rate - Complex Orthogonal Designs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2110730","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730552.pdf","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2110730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel Classes of Minimal Delay and Low PAPR Rate <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${1\\over 2}$</tex></formula> Complex Orthogonal Designs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5730552/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11878989","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Classes of Minimal Delay and Low PAPR Rate <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${1\\over 2}$</tex></formula> Complex Orthogonal Designs","sourcePdf":"tit-adams-2110730-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156877S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730553,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Amini","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Research Institute (ACRI), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Arash Amini was born in Arak, Iran, in 1982.

Since the RIP is established by means of coherence, the simple greedy algorithms such as Matching Pursuit are able to recover the sparse solution from the noiseless samples. Due to the cyclic property of the BCH codes, we show that the FFT algorithm can be employed in the reconstruction methods to considerably reduce the computational complexity.

Then, the residual ensemble of codes resulted by the BP decoder is defined and the design rate and the expectation of total number of codewords of the residual ensemble are computed. The decoding failure criterion combined with the density evolution analysis helps us to compute the asymptotic residual degree distribution for NBLDPC codes. Our approach to compute the residual degree distribution on the check node side is not efficient as it is based on enumeration of all the possible connections on the check node side which satisfy the decoding failure criterion.

We make progress on this long standing problem through a two-step approach. First, we propose a deterministic channel model which captures the key wireless properties of signal strength, broadcast and superposition. We obtain an exact characterization of the capacity of a network with nodes connected by such deterministic channels. This result is a natural generalization of the celebrated max-flow min-cut theorem for wired networks. Second, we use the insights obtained from the deterministic analysis to design a new quantize-map-and-forward scheme for Gaussian networks. In this scheme, each relay quantizes the received signal at the noise level and maps it to a random Gaussian codeword for forwarding, and the final destination decodes the source's message based on the received signal. We show that, in contrast to existing schemes, this scheme can achieve the cut-set upper bound to within a gap which is independent of the channel parameters. In the case of the relay channel with a single relay as well as the two-relay Gaussian diamond network, the gap is 1 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, the scheme is universal in the sense that the relays need no knowledge of the values of the channel parameters to (approximately) achieve the rate supportable by the network. We also present extensions of the results to multicast networks, half-duplex networks, and ergodic networks.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2110110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2110110","startPage":"1872","endPage":"1905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Network Information Flow: A Deterministic Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Network Information Flow: A Deterministic Approach","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11878992","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5730555/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Network Information Flow: A Deterministic Approach","sourcePdf":"tit-avestimehr-2110110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.245288S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"580","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5730557,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Asvadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, K.N.

It also preserves important properties of the base code such as degree distributions, and in some cases, the code rate. The constructed codes are quasi-cyclic and thus attractive from a practical point of view. The proposed method is applied to both structured and random codes over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The error floor improves consistently by increasing the lifting degree, and the results show significant improvements in the error floor compared to the base code, a random code of the same degree distribution and block length, and a random lifting of the same degree. Similar improvements are also observed when the codes designed for the BSC are applied to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2110150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2110150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730557.pdf","startPage":"2213","endPage":"2224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lowering the Error Floor of LDPC Codes Using Cyclic Liftings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Lowering the Error Floor of LDPC Codes Using Cyclic Liftings","volume":"57","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730557/","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11878994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730557/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowering the Error Floor of LDPC Codes Using Cyclic Liftings","sourcePdf":"tit-banihashemi-2110150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136989S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5730558,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Simulations are performed that corroborate the theoretical claims and show that the proposed power estimator largely outperforms alternative power inference techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2109990","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730563.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2109990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigen-Inference for Energy Estimation of Multiple Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Eigen-Inference for Energy Estimation of Multiple Sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730563/","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5730563/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11879000","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigen-Inference for Energy Estimation of Multiple Sources","sourcePdf":"tit-couillet-2109990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201488S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5730567,"authors":[{"name":"Nadia Fawaz","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nadia","lastName":"Fawaz","id":"37393631600"},{"name":"Keyvan Zarifi","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Keyvan","lastName":"Zarifi","id":"37284691900"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5730567","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":900},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Mutual information","Antennas","MIMO","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Spread spectrum communication","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","MIMO communication","precoding","relays","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic capacity","optimal precoding","MIMO","multi-hop relay networks","multi-antenna source","free probability theory","channel statistics","eigenvectors","channel correlation matrices","singular vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic capacity","correlated channel","free probability theory","multihop relay network","precoding"]}],"abstract":"A multihop relaying system is analyzed where data sent by a multi-antenna source is relayed by successive multi-antenna relays until it reaches a multi-antenna destination. Assuming correlated fading at each hop, each relay receives a faded version of the signal from the previous level, performs linear precoding and retransmits it to the next level. Using free probability theory and assuming that the noise power at relays- but not at destination- is negligible, the closed-form expression of the asymptotic instantaneous end-to-end mutual information is derived as the number of antennas at all levels grows large. The so-obtained deterministic expression is independent from the channel realizations while depending only on channel statistics. This expression is also shown to be equal to the asymptotic average end-to-end mutual information. The singular vectors of the optimal precoding matrices, maximizing the average mutual information with finite number of antennas at all levels, are also obtained. It turns out that these vectors are aligned to the eigenvectors of the channel correlation matrices. Thus, they can be determined using only the channel statistics. As the structure of the singular vectors of the optimal precoders is independent from the system size, it is also optimal in the asymptotic regime.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2111830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730567.pdf","startPage":"2050","endPage":"2069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2111830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Capacity and Optimal Precoding in MIMO Multi-Hop Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730567/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Capacity and Optimal Precoding in MIMO Multi-Hop Relay Networks","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11879004","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Capacity and Optimal Precoding in MIMO Multi-Hop Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-fawaz-2111830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070442S","chronDate":"April  2011","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"46","articleId":"5730567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5730570,"authors":[{"name":"Tiangao Gou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tiangao Gou (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Irvine, in 2009.

The MMSE can be regarded as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as a functional of the input distribution (of the random variable to be estimated). It is shown that the MMSE is concave in the input distribution at any given SNR. For a given input distribution, the MMSE is found to be infinitely differentiable at all positive SNR, and in fact a real analytic function in SNR under mild conditions. The key to these regularity results is that the posterior distribution conditioned on the observation through Gaussian channels always decays at least as quickly as some Gaussian density. Furthermore, simple expressions for the first three derivatives of the MMSE with respect to the SNR are obtained. It is also shown that, as functions of the SNR, the curves for the MMSE of a Gaussian input and that of a non-Gaussian input cross at most once over all SNRs. These properties lead to simple proofs of the facts that Gaussian inputs achieve both the secrecy capacity of scalar Gaussian wiretap channels and the capacity of scalar Gaussian broadcast channels, as well as a simple proof of the entropy power inequality in the special case where one of the variables is Gaussian.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730572.pdf","startPage":"2371","endPage":"2385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2111010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2111010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation in Gaussian Noise: Properties of the Minimum Mean-Square Error","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Random variables","Gaussian noise","Entropy","Estimation error","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise estimation","minimum mean square error","arbitrary random variable","signal to noise ratio","real analytic function","MMSE","Gaussian wiretap channel","Gaussian broadcast channel","Gaussian density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Entropy","estimation","Gaussian broadcast channel","Gaussian noise","Gaussian wiretap channel","minimum mean square error (MMSE)","mutual information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Estimation in Gaussian Noise: Properties of the Minimum Mean-Square Error","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5730572/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11879008","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation in Gaussian Noise: Properties of the Minimum Mean-Square Error","sourcePdf":"tit-guo-2111010-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145946S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730572","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730574,"authors":[{"name":"Pavlos Kazakopoulos","affiliation":["Physics Department, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Pavlos Kazakopoulos received the B.S.degree in physics from the University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in particle physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2005.","Between 2006 and 2009, he did Postdoctoral Research on the application of statistical physics methods to communications and networks at the University of Athens.

Further, with high probability, the recovery error from noisy data is within a constant of three targets: (1) the minimax risk, (2) an \u201coracle\u201d error that would be available if the column space of the matrix were known, and (3) a more adaptive \u201coracle\u201d error which would be available with the knowledge of the column space corresponding to the part of the matrix that stands above the noise. Lastly, the error bounds regarding low-rank matrices are extended to provide an error bound when the matrix has full rank with decaying singular values.

We derive this graph representation by linearizing the ML detection metric, which transforms the equalization problem into a classical decoding problem. We observe that the performance of LP and IMP decoding on this model are very similar in the uncoded case, while IMP decoding significantly outperforms LP decoding when low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are used. In particular, in the absence of coding, for certain classes of channels, both LP and IMP algorithms always find the exact ML solution using the proposed graph representation, without complexity that is exponential in the size of the channel memory. This applies even to certain two-dimensional ISI channels. However, for some other channel impulse responses, both decoders have nondiminishing probability of failure as SNR increases. We provide analytical explanations for many of these observations. In addition, we study the error events of LP decoding in the uncoded case, and derive a measure that can be used to classify ISI channels in terms of the performance of the proposed detection scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2110070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730584.pdf","startPage":"2188","endPage":"2202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2110070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-Based Decoding in the Presence of ISI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730584/","displayDocTitle":"Graph-Based Decoding in the Presence of ISI","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11879019","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730584/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-Based Decoding in the Presence of ISI","sourcePdf":"tit-taghavi-2110070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075737S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730586,"authors":[{"name":"Ersen Ekrem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ersen","lastName":"Ekrem","id":"37395816700"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5730586","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":159,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1554},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Covariance matrix","Encoding","Markov processes","Noise","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","covariance matrices","encoding","Gaussian channels","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy capacity region","Gaussian MIMO multireceiver wiretap channel","multiple-input multiple-output channel","single-input single-output case","Gaussian scalar broadcast channel","proof technique","minimum-mean-square-error","mutual information","Fisher information","differential entropy","SISO channel","MMSE","positive semidefinite order","noise covariance matrices","channel enhancement technique","dirty-paper coding","Gaussian signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel","information theoretic security","secrecy capacity region"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730586","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730586.pdf","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2111750","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2111750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Secrecy Capacity Region of the Gaussian MIMO Multi-Receiver Wiretap Channel","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multi-receiver wiretap channel in which a transmitter wants to have confidential communication with an arbitrary number of users in the presence of an external eavesdropper. We derive the secrecy capacity region of this channel for the most general case. We first show that even for the single-input single-output (SISO) case, existing converse techniques for the Gaussian scalar broadcast channel cannot be extended to this secrecy context, to emphasize the need for a new proof technique. Our new proof technique makes use of the relationships between the minimum-mean-square-error and the mutual information, and equivalently, the relationships between the Fisher information and the differential entropy. Using the intuition gained from the converse proof of the SISO channel, we first prove the secrecy capacity region of the degraded MIMO channel, in which all receivers have the same number of antennas, and the noise covariance matrices can be arranged according to a positive semi-definite order. We then generalize this result to the aligned case, in which all receivers have the same number of antennas; however, there is no order among the noise covariance matrices. We accomplish this task by using the channel enhancement technique. Finally, we find the secrecy capacity region of the general MIMO channel by using some limiting arguments on the secrecy capacity region of the aligned MIMO channel. We show that the capacity achieving coding scheme is a variant of dirty-paper coding with Gaussian signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","volume":"57","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11879021","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Secrecy Capacity Region of the Gaussian MIMO Multi-Receiver Wiretap Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Secrecy Capacity Region of the Gaussian MIMO Multi-Receiver Wiretap Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-ulukus-2111750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039428S","chronDate":"April  2011","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"159","articleId":"5730586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5730587,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Corporate Research and Development, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yi Jiang (S'01\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, in 2001.

This paper analyzes the channel dispersion for a simple channel with memory: the Gilbert-Elliott communication model in which the crossover probability of a binary symmetric channel evolves as a binary symmetric Markov chain, with and without side information at the receiver about the channel state. With side information, dispersion is equal to the average of the dispersions of the individual binary symmetric channels plus a term that depends on the Markov chain dynamics, which do not affect the channel capacity. Without side information, dispersion is equal to the spectral density at zero of a certain stationary process, whose mean is the capacity. In addition, the finite blocklength behavior is analyzed in the non-ergodic case, in which the chain remains in the initial state forever.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2111070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730589.pdf","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2111070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dispersion of the Gilbert-Elliott Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Dispersion of the Gilbert-Elliott Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730589/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11879024","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730589/","volume":"57","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dispersion of the Gilbert-Elliott Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-verdu-2111070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127086S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5730593,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Yang","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, SUPELEC, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"p":["Sheng Yang (M'07) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001, and both the engineer degree and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST), Paris, France, in 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Universit\u00e9 de Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI) in 2007.","From 2004 to 2007, he was a teaching and research assistant in the Communications and Electronics Department, ENST.

While the ergodic capacity of fading channels grows logarithmically with SNR in general, we have found that the secrecy capacity converges to an upper-bound (a closed-form expression is derived) that will be shown to be a function of two channel parameters; the correlation coefficient and the ratio of the main to eavesdropper channel gains.

It is assumed that the number of active users is a realization of a random variable with a given probability mass function. Moreover, users are unaware of each other's codebooks and hence, no multiuser detection is possible. We propose a randomized frequency hopping (FH) scheme in which each transmitter randomly hops over a subset of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">u</i>\n subbands from transmission slot to transmission slot. Assuming all users transmit Gaussian signals, the distribution of the noise plus interference is mixed Gaussian, which makes calculation of the mutual information between the transmitted and received signals of each user intractable. We derive lower and upper bounds on the mutual information of each user and demonstrate that, for large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, the two bounds coincide. This observation enables us to compute the sum multiplexing gain of the system and obtain the optimum hopping strategy for maximizing this quantity. We compare the performance of the FH system to that of the frequency division (FD) system in terms of the following performance measures: average sum multiplexing gain (\u03b7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(1)</sup>\n) and average minimum multiplexing gain per user (\u03b7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(2)</sup>\n). We show that (depending on the probability mass function of the number of active users) the FH system can offer a significant improvement in terms of \u03b7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(1)</sup>\n and \u03b7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(2)</sup>\n (implying a more efficient usage of the spectrum). In the sequel, we consider a scenario where the transmitters are unaware of the number of active users in the network as well as the channel gains. Developing a new upper bound on the differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random vector and using entropy power inequality, we obtain lower bounds on the maximum transmission rate per user to ensure a specified outage probability at a given SNR level. We demonstrate that the so-called outage capacity can be considerably higher in the FH scheme than in the FD scenario for reasonable distributions on the number of active users. This guarantees a higher spectral efficiency in FH compared to FD.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Upper bound","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","frequency hop communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomized resource allocation","decentralized wireless communication network","probability mass function","random variable","transmitter-receiver pairs","codebooks","randomized frequency hopping scheme","Gaussian signals","noise plus interference","mutual information","signal-to-noise ratio values","optimum hopping strategy","frequency division system","average sum multiplexing gain","average minimum multiplexing gain per user","differential entropy","mixed Gaussian random vector","entropy power inequality","maximum transmission rate per user","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized networks","frequency hopping (FH)","mixed Gaussian interference","multiplexing gain","outage capacity","randomized signaling","spectrum sharing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2112030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730600.pdf","startPage":"2115","endPage":"2142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2112030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Resource Allocation in Decentralized Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Resource Allocation in Decentralized Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730600/","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730600/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11879035","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Resource Allocation in Decentralized Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-khandani-2112030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127807S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730602,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Babu Korada","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Satish Babu Korada received the B.Tech. degree electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2009.","Since September 2009, he has been a postdoctorate at Stanford University, Stanford, CA.

The asymptotic (in the length) performance of such a combination for a fixed number of iterations is given by density evolution. Letting the number of iterations tend to infinity we get the density evolution (DE) threshold, the largest channel parameter so that the bit error probability tends to zero as a function of the iterations. In practice, we often work with short codes and perform a large number of iterations. It is, therefore, interesting to consider what happens if in the standard analysis we exchange the order in which the blocklength and the number of iterations diverge to infinity. In particular, we can ask whether both limits give the same threshold. Although empirical observations strongly suggest that the exchange of limits is valid for all channel parameters, we limit our discussion to channel parameters below the DE threshold. Specifically, we show that as long as the message reliabilities are bounded and other technical conditions are met, the bit error probability vanishes up to a nontrivial threshold regardless of how the limit is taken. This threshold is equal to the DE threshold when the minimum degree of the variable nodes is at least five and strictly less than the DE threshold for smaller degrees.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exchange of Limits: Why Iterative Decoding Works","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2111730","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5730547/05730602.pdf","startPage":"2169","endPage":"2187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2111730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730602/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Exchange of Limits: Why Iterative Decoding Works","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5730602/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11879037","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exchange of Limits: Why Iterative Decoding Works","sourcePdf":"tit-korada-2111730-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107204S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5730547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5730547","articleId":"5730602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5730603,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Babu Korada","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Satish Babu Korada received the B.Tech. degree electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2009.","Since September 2009, he has been a postdoctorate at Stanford University, Stanford, CA.

In the framework of this initiative a new mathematically supported approach for the roadmapping in power electronics has been developed. As described in this paper the procedure relies on a comprehensive mathematical modeling and subsequent multi-objective optimization of a converter system. The relationship between the technological base and the performance of the system then exists as a mathematical representation, whose optimization assures the best possible exploitation of the available degrees of freedom and technologies. Thus an objective Technology Node of a system is obtained, whereby physical limits are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the system performance with regard to the technological base can be calculated directly and the internal interdependence of Performance Indices directly studied. Accordingly, the improvement in performance achievable by improvements in the technology base can be tested and assessed in advance. Moreover, different system concepts, i.e. circuit topologies, control procedures, etc. can be evaluated and directly compared with regard to achievable efficiency, power density and costs in the form of the associated Pareto Front which defines the boundary of the Feasible Performance Space. If the target performance lies outside the Pareto Envelope of known system concepts and state-of-the-art technologies, a new technology must be employed. The necessity of a technological leap, i.e. the introduction of a Disruptive Technology can thus be recognized at an early stage. This offers an excellent basis for effective roadmapping for various main application areas in power electronics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730627/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730627/","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance trends and limitations of power electronic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance trends and limitations of power electronic systems","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"313212001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082433S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5720566","isNumber":"5730626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5720566","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5730626","articleId":"5730627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5730633,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Kriegel","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Kriegel","id":"37845726400"},{"name":"Ashot Melkonyan","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ashot","lastName":"Melkonyan","id":"37266933500"},{"name":"Marek Galek","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Galek","id":"37845725800"},{"name":"Juergen Rackles","affiliation":["Munich University of Applied Science, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Rackles","id":"37845726100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3212-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-814-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5730633","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power module with solid state circuit breakers for fault-tolerant applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Integrated Power Electronics Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5720566/5730626/05730633.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Integrated Power Electronics Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730626","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Leg","Fault tolerant systems","Silicon carbide","Driver circuits","Schottky diodes","Insulated gate bipolar transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace safety","circuit breakers","fault tolerance","insulated gate bipolar transistors","invertors","modules","motor drives","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid state circuit breaker","aerospace safety","redundancy","fail safe operability","fault tolerant inverter","inverter topology","switching loss minimization","IGBT","silicon carbide diodes","enhanced intelligent power module"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730633","abstract":"Due to safety reasons in some applications and especially in aerospace applications a fail safe operability is crucial. One solution for this operability is redundancy but size, weight and costs are doubled. Another approach is to design a fault tolerant system which ensures the fail safe operability.

The fault tolerant inverter consists of four phase legs, three phase legs for the conventional inverter topology and a redundant one. Additionally there are solid state circuit breakers in the system in order to minimize the conduction losses during operation. In order to minimize the switching losses during normal operation newest IGBT and silicon carbide diodes are used. Two phase legs with circuit breakers are integrated in one power module. Due to the enhanced functionality the modules are called Enhanced Intelligent Power Modules (EIPM). Two of these power modules are used for the fault tolerant inverter topology. The results, simulations and first measurements are shown in order to demonstrate the functionality of the system. This work was done in the European funded project MOET together with Airbus.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11874174","htmlLink":"/document/5730633/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power module with solid state circuit breakers for fault-tolerant applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power module with solid state circuit breakers for fault-tolerant applications","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"313212007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057621S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5720566","isNumber":"5730626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5720566","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5730626","articleId":"5730633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5730643,"authors":[{"name":"Martin M\u00e4rz","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Systems and Device Technology, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"M\u00e4rz","id":"37409429100"},{"name":"Andreas Schletz","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Systems and Device Technology, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Schletz","id":"37391542000"},{"name":"Bernd Eckardt","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Systems and Device Technology, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Eckardt","id":"37847123800"},{"name":"Sven Egelkraut","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Systems and Device Technology, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Egelkraut","id":"37391532800"},{"name":"Hubert Rauh","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Systems and Device Technology, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hubert","lastName":"Rauh","id":"37862449900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3212-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-814-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5730643","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2034},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730643","abstract":"The paper gives an overview of the basic requirements, concepts, and trends regarding a system integration of power electronics in hybrid (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV).

The expansion from small single device applications through industrial inverters up to large traction motor drives and HVDC converters have been possible mainly thanks to the fact that the IGBT devices can be paralleled and in addition series connected to achieve the high currents needed to realize multi megawatt applications. However, the demand for increasing power combined with the requirement of increasing reliability needs further understanding of the limiting mechanisms for stable paralleling and predictable sharing between the devices. New semiconductor generations have been developed to achieve lower losses and higher current densities, and some newly introduced properties have lead to changes of the behaviour in parallel setups. The following paper gives an overview of the issues to overcome when designing large scale paralleled IGBT devices and applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic paralleling problems in IGBT module construction and application","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Integrated Power Electronics Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Conference on Integrated Power Electronics Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5720566/5730626/05730646.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5730646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic paralleling problems in IGBT module construction and application","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5730646/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11874186","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic paralleling problems in IGBT module construction and application","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"313212021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091022S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5720566","isNumber":"5730626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5720566","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5730626","articleId":"5730646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5730676,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Lidow","affiliation":["Efficient Power Conversion Corporation, El Segundo, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Lidow","id":"37271322800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3212-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-814-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5730676","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":690},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Silicon","Power MOSFET","Transistors","Switches","Epitaxial growth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","power MOSFET","system-on-chip","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power conversion","power management efficiency","power MOSFET structures","circuit topologies","silicon substrate","DC-DC conversion","class D audio applications","system-on-chip integration","GaN-on-silicon","GaN","Si"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5730676","abstract":"For the past three decades, power management efficiency and cost have shown steady improvement as innovations in power MOSFET structures, technology, and circuit topologies have paced the growing need for electrical power in our daily lives.

Enhancement mode devices, first introduced in June 2009, will be demonstrated in DC-DC conversion and Class D audio applications. GaN roadmaps for improved device performance and for system-on-chip integration will also be discussed. Performance is only one dimension of the equation leading to the conclusion that GaN-on-silicon is a game-changer. The other dimensions are product reliability and cost.

An additional challenge to the development of lightwave systems has been the continued rapid evolution and improvement in this technology. Do we introduce today's technology or do we wait for tomorrow's? Optical Fiber or Lightwave Communication Systems have offered important advantages which include large bandwidth and low transmission loss. These advantages will be discussed and analyzed.

The hardware reduction approach is performed by using the single shift registers instead of barrel shift switches in floating point adders by self-timed techniques, which introduces the dependency of FFT processor response time on input data stream.","displayPublicationTitle":"Signals, Circuits and Systems, 2003.

The objective is achieved by satisfying frequency domain stability criteria via feedback parameters related to circulant matrices. The approach, by generating CNN's conditions, enables both hetero-associative and auto-associative memories to be designed. Finally, two examples highlight the capabilities of the designed networks in storing and retrieving information.","doi":"10.1109/SCS.2003.1226980","startPage":"189","endPage":"192 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Signals, Circuits and Systems, 2003.

Key to this approach is the manner in which different operating conditions are sampled to form a database for training. This paper develops an efficient sampling strategy that maximizes database information content while minimizing computing requirements. The approach involves two stages: stage-I to find the high information content region in the multidimensional operating parameter state space and stage-II to bias the sampling towards that region using importance sampling. The proposed approach is applied for deriving operating rules against voltage stability issues on the Brittany region of the French EHV system. The results show that the decision trees produced by the proposed efficient sampling approach have significantly improved classification performance and offer economic benefits compared to conventional sampling strategies, all at greatly reduced computational requirements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2112784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6048014/05732673.pdf","startPage":"2319","endPage":"2327","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2112784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Database Generation for Decision Tree Based Power System Security Assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Database Generation for Decision Tree Based Power System Security Assessment","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5732673/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301710","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Database Generation for Decision Tree Based Power System Security Assessment","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-krishnan-2112784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116713S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6048014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6048014","articleId":"5732673","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5732680,"authors":[{"name":"Goo Jun","affiliation":["Department of Biostatics, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5910675/5732680/5732680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Goo Jun (S'06\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 1997, the M.S. degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, in 2010.","From 1999 to 2005, he was with Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea, as a Research Engineer.

In hyperspectral images, spectral responses of land covers vary over space, and conventional classification algorithms that result in spatially invariant solutions are fundamentally limited. In the proposed framework, each band of a given class is modeled by a Gaussian random process indexed by spatial coordinates. These models are then used to characterize each land cover class at a given location by a multivariate Gaussian distribution with parameters adapted for that location. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively captures the spatial variations of hyperspectral data, significantly outperforming a variety of other classification algorithms on three different hyperspectral data sets.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2105490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910675","startPage":"2662","endPage":"2673","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5910675/05732680.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Classification of Land Cover With Remote Sensing Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5732680/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Classification of Land Cover With Remote Sensing Data","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12073001","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Adaptive Classification of Land Cover With Remote Sensing Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-jun-2105490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176931S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5910675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5910675","articleId":"5732680","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5732682,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Hur","affiliation":["School of Electric Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5768120/5732682/5732682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin Hur (S'93\u2013M'98\u2013SM'03) was born in Seoul, Korea, on November 13, 1968.

This paper presents a new harmonic analysis algorithm, which successfully adjusts an actual sampling sequence to an ideal sampling sequence synchronized with the original signal. First, a fundamental period is evaluated by a zero-crossing technique, and then, according to this fundamental period, the sampling sequence is reconstructed by the time-domain Newton's interpolation polynomial. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy in measuring distorted and noisy signals by reducing spectral leakage effectively in the framework of the International Electrotechnical Commission standards. Moreover, the proposed method maintains high measurement accuracy for nonstationary and slow-changing signals even at low-frequency resolution. The results of the field experiment confirm the effectiveness of this algorithm under practical considerations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5732685/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12141696","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Quasi-Synchronous Sampling Algorithm for Harmonic Analysis Based on Newton's Interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Quasi-Synchronous Sampling Algorithm for Harmonic Analysis Based on Newton's Interpolation","sourcePdf":"tim-zhou-2118890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062272S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5948426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5948426","articleId":"5732685","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5732688,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian P.

The precision of such a system is, in part, dependent on the modulation frequency. There is typically a tradeoff between precision and maximum unambiguous range. Research has shown that, by taking two measurements at different modulation frequencies, the unambiguous range can be extended without compromising distance precision. In this paper, we present an efficient method for combining two distance measurements obtained using different modulation frequencies. The behavior of the method in the presence of noise has been investigated to determine the expected error rate. In addition, we make use of the signal amplitude to improve the precision of the combined distance measurement.

Unlike several current techniques, the presented estimation method is effective with any initial attitude error. The estimator is based on the decomposition of the attitude quaternion into separate Earth motion, inertial rate, and alignment quaternions. The alignment quaternion is estimated using a minimum variance fit between loci of body- and navigation-frame velocity vectors using solutions to Wahba's problem. One set of vectors is derived from time integrals of measured vehicle motions, and the second set is derived from Earth motion and GPS data (when moving). For the case of quasi-static alignment, an algebraic expression for the covariance of the attitude estimate as a function of the variance of navigation-frame velocity disturbances is developed. It is shown that, by averaging and interleaving the velocity vectors, the resulting attitude estimate is improved over sequential sampling techniques. It is further shown, for a maneuvering vessel, that a continuous estimate of the attitude error covariance can be generated from the IMU data. This latter feature allows direct initialization of a follow-on fine-alignment stochastic estimator's covariance matrix. Results are presented for quasi-static alignment using inertial sensors only and for full in-motion alignment using navigation-frame GPS velocity and position aiding.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2113131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5765517/05732690.pdf","startPage":"1930","endPage":"1941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2113131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Coarse Alignment of a Ship's Strapdown Inertial Attitude Reference System Using Velocity Loci","volume":"60","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11976060","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732690/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coarse Alignment of a Ship's Strapdown Inertial Attitude Reference System Using Velocity Loci","sourcePdf":"tim-silson-2113131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040756S","chronDate":"June  2011","isNumber":"5765517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"130","articleId":"5732690","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5732696,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Bruser","affiliation":["Medical Information Technology, Helmholtz-Institute of Biomedical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/6008174/5732696/5732696-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christoph Br\u00fcser (S'05) was born in Troisdorf, Germany, in 1983.

Compared to many existing algorithms, the new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis. The agreement of the proposed algorithm with an ECG reference has been evaluated. A relative beat-to-beat interval error of 1.79% with a coverage of 95.94% was achieved on recordings from 16 subjects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beat-to-Beat Heart Rate Estimation in Ballistocardiograms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2011.2128337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/6008174/05732696.pdf","startPage":"778","endPage":"786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2011.2128337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5732696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beat-to-Beat Heart Rate Estimation in Ballistocardiograms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5732696/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216109","pubMedId":"21421447","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beat-to-Beat Heart Rate Estimation in Ballistocardiograms","sourcePdf":"titb-brueser-2128337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083438S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6008174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6008174","articleId":"5732696","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5732698,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Wollmer","affiliation":["Institute of Human-Machine-Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5779921/5732698/5732698-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin W\u00f6llmer (M'09) received the Diploma in electrical engineering and information technology from Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), M\u00fcnchen, Germany.","He works as a Researcher, funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Program Project SEMAINE (FP7/2007-2013), with TUM, where his current research and teaching activity includes the subject areas of pattern recognition and speech processing.

However, the drawback due to the lack of force and tactile feedback presents a great deal of limitations in MIS procedures. Tissue palpation, which is easily conducted during traditional open surgery to examine tissue properties and abnormalities, is not possible when performing surgery in a minimally invasive manner. This paper proposes a specially designed miniature 3-axis distal force sensor that can be used to perform tissue palpation, measuring tissue interaction forces at the tip of a surgical instrument. Relying on an optical sensing scheme, the sensor can measure forces within measurement ranges of \u00b13 N in axial direction and \u00b11.5 N in radial direction. The resolution is 0.02 N. It is compatible with laparoscopic operations and can be used to localize tissue lesions or relatively hard nodules buried under an organ's surface, which are not detectable by visual means.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2116033","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6195075/05732701.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2116033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6195075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniature 3-Axis Distal Force Sensor for Minimally Invasive Surgical Palpation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5732701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732701/","displayDocTitle":"Miniature 3-Axis Distal Force Sensor for Minimally Invasive Surgical Palpation","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12696690","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniature 3-Axis Distal Force Sensor for Minimally Invasive Surgical Palpation","sourcePdf":"tmech-puangmali-2116033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051386S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","isNumber":"6195075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"153","articleId":"5732701","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5732703,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Di Marco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Siena, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Di Marco","id":"37418990500"},{"name":"Massimo Grazzini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Siena, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Grazzini","id":"37397145100"},{"name":"Luca Pancioni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Siena, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Pancioni","id":"37267334700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5732703","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5732703","abstract":"This brief considers a class of delayed full-range (FR) cellular neural networks (CNNs) with uncertain interconnections between neurons modeled by means of intervalized matrices.

This paper presents a practical approach for designing a mixed linear/adaptive model reference controller that recovers the performance of a reference model, and guarantees the boundedness of the tracking error within an a priori specified compact domain, in the presence of bounded uncertainties. The linear part of the controller results from the solution of an optimization problem where specifications are expressed as linear matrix inequality constraints. The linear controller is then augmented with a general adaptive NN that compensates for the uncertainties. The only requirement for the NN is that its output must be confined within pre-specified saturation limits. Toward this end a specific NN output confinement algorithm is proposed in this paper. The main advantages of the proposed approach are that requirements in terms of worst-case performance can be easily defined during the design phase, and that the design of the adaptation mechanism is largely independent from the synthesis of the linear controller. A numerical example is used to illustrate the design methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11909995","pubMedId":"21421434","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5732704/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of a Neural Network Adaptive Controller via a Constrained Invariant Ellipsoids Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Neural Network Adaptive Controller via a Constrained Invariant Ellipsoids Technique","sourcePdf":"tnn-fravolini-2111385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126603S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5741988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5741988","articleId":"5732704","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5732705,"authors":[{"name":"Vassilis Vassiliades","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5741988/5732705/5732705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vassilis Vassiliades received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in intelligent systems engineering, from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2008.

The contradictory nature of these games makes their study in multiagent systems quite challenging. In particular, we investigate MARL with spiking and nonspiking agents in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma by exploring the conditions required to enhance its cooperative outcome. The spiking agents are neural networks with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons trained with two different learning algorithms: 1) reinforcement of stochastic synaptic transmission, or 2) reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity with eligibility trace. The nonspiking agents use a tabular representation and are trained with Q- and SARSA learning algorithms, with a novel reward transformation process also being applied to the Q-learning agents. According to the results, the cooperative outcome is enhanced by: 1) transformed internal reinforcement signals and a combination of a high learning rate and a low discount factor with an appropriate exploration schedule in the case of non-spiking agents, and 2) having longer eligibility trace time constant in the case of spiking agents. Moreover, it is shown that spiking and nonspiking agents have similar behavior and therefore they can equally well be used in a multiagent interaction setting. For training the spiking agents in the case where more than one output neuron competes for reinforcement, a novel and necessary modification that enhances competition is applied to the two learning algorithms utilized, in order to avoid a possible synaptic saturation. This is done by administering to the networks additional global reinforcement signals for every spike of the output neurons that were not \u201cresponsible\u201d for the preceding decision.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2111384","startPage":"639","endPage":"653","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5741988/05732705.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2111384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5741988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Spiking and Nonspiking Agents in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Games","Artificial neural networks","Biological system modeling","Neurotransmitters","Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent reinforcement learning","spiking agent","nonspiking agent","iterated prisoner dilemma","general-sum game","multi-agent systems","integrate-and-fire neurons","stochastic synaptic transmission","reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity","tabular representation","Q-learning algorithm","SARSA learning algorithm","reward transformation process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiagent reinforcement learning","Prisoner's Dilemma","reward transformation","spiking neural networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Animals","Humans","Models, Neurological","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons","Reinforcement (Psychology)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Spiking and Nonspiking Agents in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5732705/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2011","accessionNumber":"11909996","pubMedId":"21421435","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Spiking and Nonspiking Agents in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma","sourcePdf":"tnn-vassiliades-2111384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114186S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5741988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5741988","articleId":"5732705","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5732712,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Masmoudi","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Masmoudi","id":"38196006000"},{"name":"Faouzi Bellili","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bellili","id":"37391785500"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e8ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00e8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Alex Stephenne","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Stephenne","id":"37294239900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5732712","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":864},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Binary phase shift keying","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Timing","Time frequency analysis","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","minimum shift keying","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exact Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds","symbol timing recovery","BPSK","MSK","square-QAM transmissions","binary phase shift keying","minimum shift keying","Nyquist criterion","shaping pulse","carrier phase","carrier frequency","observation interval","received signal","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-data-aided (NDA) estimation","QAM signals","stochastic Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound (CRLB)","symbol timing recovery"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive for the first time analytical expressions for the exact Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for symbol timing recovery of binary phase shift keying (BPSK), minimum shift keying (MSK), and square QAM-modulated signals.

First of all, we focus on the selection of the radar signal optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in correspondence of a given expected target Doppler frequency (Algorithm 1). Then, through a max-min approach, we make robust the technique with respect to the received Doppler (Algorithm 2), namely we optimize the worst case SNR under the same constraints as in the previous problem. Since Algorithms 1 and 2 do not impose any condition on the waveform phase, we also devise their phase quantized versions (Algorithms 3 and 4, respectively), which force the waveform phase to lie within a finite alphabet. All the problems are formulated in terms of nonconvex quadratic optimization programs with either a finite or an infinite number of quadratic constraints. We prove that these problems are NP-hard and, hence, introduce design techniques, relying on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and randomization as well as on the theory of trigonometric polynomials, providing high-quality suboptimal solutions with a polynomial time computational complexity. Finally, we analyze the performance of the new waveform design algorithms in terms of detection performance and robustness with respect to Doppler shifts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12006318","htmlLink":"/document/5732713/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Optimized Radar Codes With a Peak to Average Power Ratio Constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Optimized Radar Codes With a Peak to Average Power Ratio Constraint","sourcePdf":"tsp-demaio-2128313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147142S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5767741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5767741","articleId":"5732713","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5732748,"authors":[{"name":"Vemal Raja Manikam","affiliation":["School of Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5746823/5732748/5732748-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vemal Raja Manikam received the B.Eng. degree in materials engineering from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia, in 2005, and the M.Eng. degree in manufacturing engineering from Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2009.

Like any long-range active sonar system, LFAS produces a large amount of unwanted sea bottom echoes or clutter. These echoes give way to false alarms that increase the computational load of target trackers and delay the correct classification of each echo. The number of false alarms due to clutter can be reduced either through echo classification techniques or through Doppler filtering provided the targets of interest have a nonzero radial velocity. Much research has been carried out on waveform investigation for the efficient use of bandwidth capabilities of modern sonar transmitters. Among the quantity of waveforms, binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) pulses have emerged as exhibiting cross-correlation properties relevant to Doppler filtering while maintaining a range resolution comparable to frequency-modulated (FM) pulses. In this paper, we have successfully applied a false-alarm reduction technique using contacts obtained with an FM pulse subsequently processed by Doppler filtering with a BPSK pulse. The Doppler filtering performance for this pulse is evaluated on an experimental data set and a few limitations of BPSK are identified.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2010.2094770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5732754/05732762.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2010.2094770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732754","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"False-Alarm Reduction for Low-Frequency Active Sonar With BPSK Pulses: Experimental Results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5732762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"False-Alarm Reduction for Low-Frequency Active Sonar With BPSK Pulses: Experimental Results","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11883053","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5732762/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"False-Alarm Reduction for Low-Frequency Active Sonar With BPSK Pulses: Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"joe-colin-2094770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079939S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5732754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5732754","articleId":"5732762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5732766,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Yerramalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Yerramalli","id":"37400050100"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0364-9059"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1691"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7786"}],"articleNumber":"5732766","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":893},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society","url":"http://www.oceanicengineering.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Approximation methods","Doppler effect","Delay","Time frequency analysis","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal detection","approximation theory","intercarrier interference","matched filters","OFDM modulation","signal sampling","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signal sampling","optimal resampling","multiscale-multilag underwater acoustic channel","path-dependent time scaling","intercarrier interference","ICI","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","front-end processing","Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound","Cramer-Rao bound","matched filtering","single-scale approximation","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly selective","multiscale Doppler compensation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","parameter estimation","reduced rank","resampling","underwater acoustic channels (UACs)"]}],"abstract":"Underwater acoustic channels (UACs) have a large fractional bandwidth and are well modeled by a multiscale-multilag model, which is a generalization of the commonly employed single time-scale model. The path-dependent time scaling introduces significant channel variation, destroying carrier orthogonality and yielding intercarrier interference (ICI) in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Typical front-end processing at the receiver for a channel with common time scaling on every path involves resampling the received signal to compensate for this scaling. This work examines the choice of resampling parameter for the multiscale scenario. Bounds are derived for the performance and hard and soft data detection schemes using the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound (HCRB) and the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB), respectively, which when optimized yield the optimal resampling parameter. It is shown that resampling is equivalent to matched filtering the incoming signal with an approximated channel having a common time scale on each path. A second criterion for optimizing the resampling parameter then minimizes the aggregate error between the multiscale channel and its single-scale approximation. Analysis of special cases suggests that the optimal resampling parameter is close to the time-scaling parameter of the dominant path. The scenarios under which using the time-scaling factor on the dominant path for resampling are suboptimal are also investigated. Blind and pilot-aided estimators for the optimal resampling parameter, which are a generalization of the estimators for the common time-scale model, are derived building on the channel approximation model for resampling. Numerical simulations show the advantages of the derived estimators over a classical packet-length-based time-scale estimator.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2010.2093752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5732754/05732766.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2010.2093752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5732754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resampling of OFDM Signals for Multiscale\u2013Multilag Underwater Acoustic Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5732766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5732766/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resampling of OFDM Signals for Multiscale\u2013Multilag Underwater Acoustic Channels","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11883057","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Resampling of OFDM Signals for Multiscale\u2013Multilag Underwater Acoustic Channels","sourcePdf":"joe-yerramalli-2093752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047732S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","isNumber":"5732754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"44","articleId":"5732766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733223,"authors":[{"name":"Ruizhi Liao","affiliation":["NeTS Research Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruizhi","lastName":"Liao","id":"37850977300"},{"name":"Boris Bellalta","affiliation":["NeTS Research Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Bellalta","id":"37330390400"},{"name":"Cristina Cano","affiliation":["NeTS Research Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Cano","id":"37267970100"},{"name":"Miquel Oliver","affiliation":["NeTS Research Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Miquel","lastName":"Oliver","id":"37333450300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8513-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8511-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8512-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5733223","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"abstract":"Multi-user MIMO is a promising technology to enhance the performance of WLANs.

However, little is known about the distribution of nuclei in tissues. Therefore, the acoustic pressure level necessary to generate bubbles in a targeted zone and their exact location are currently difficult to predict. To monitor the initiation of cavitation activity, a novel all-ultrasound technique sensitive to single nucleation events is presented here. It is based on combined passive detection and ultrafast active imaging over a large volume using the same multi-element probe. Bubble nucleation was induced using a focused transducer (660 kHz, f-number = 1) driven by a high-power electric burst (up to 300 W) of one to two cycles. Detection was performed with a linear array (4 to 7 MHz) aligned with the single-element focal point. In vitro experiments in gelatin gel and muscular tissue are presented. The synchronized passive detection enabled radio-frequency data to be recorded, comprising high-frequency coherent wave fronts as signatures of the acoustic emissions linked to the activation of the nuclei. Active change detection images were obtained by subtracting echoes collected in the unnucleated medium. These indicated the appearance of stable cavitating regions. Because of the ultrafast frame rate, active detection occurred as quickly as 330 \u03bcs after the high-amplitude excitation and the dynamics of the induced regions were studied individually.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","volume":"58","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11874648","pubMedId":"21429844","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733255/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Combined passive detection and ultrafast active imaging of cavitation events induced by short pulses of high-intensity ultrasound","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined passive detection and ultrafast active imaging of cavitation events induced by short pulses of high-intensity ultrasound","sourcePdf":"t1130517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120613S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5733245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5733245","articleId":"5733255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5733342,"authors":[{"name":"Haikun Liu","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Haikun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37655834400"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37276607900"},{"name":"Xiaofei Liao","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Liao","id":"37269559200"},{"name":"Chen Yu","affiliation":["Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37675195300"},{"name":"Cheng-Zhong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Zhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278305300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"5733342","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":2245},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Algorithm design and analysis","Wide area networks","Local area networks","Virtual machining","Checkpointing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","computer centres","local area networks","virtual machines","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["live virtual machine migration","asynchronous replication","state synchronization","data centers","data clusters","local area networks","wide area network","CR/TR-Motion","checkpointing technology","recovery technology","trace technology","replay technology","migration downtime reduction","network bandwidth consumption reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Copy-on-write checkpointing","deterministic replay","live migration","trace","virtual machine."]}],"abstract":"Live migration of virtual machines (VM) across physical hosts provides a significant new benefit for administrators of data centers and clusters. Previous memory-to-memory approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of live VM migration in local area networks (LAN), but they would cause a long period of downtime in a wide area network (WAN) environment. This paper describes the design and implementation of a novel approach, namely, CR/TR-Motion, which adopts checkpointing/recovery and trace/replay technologies to provide fast, transparent VM migration for both LAN and WAN environments. With execution trace logged on the source host, a synchronization algorithm is performed to orchestrate the running source and target VMs until they reach a consistent state. CR/TR-Motion can greatly reduce the migration downtime and network bandwidth consumption. Experimental results show that the approach can drastically reduce migration overheads compared with memory-to-memory approach in a LAN: up to 72.4 percent on application observed downtime, up to 31.5 percent on total migration time, and up to 95.9 percent on the data to synchronize the VM state. The application performance overhead due to migration is kept within 8.54 percent on average. The results also show that for a variety of workloads migrated across WANs, the migration downtime is less than 300 milliseconds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Live Virtual Machine Migration via Asynchronous Replication and State Synchronization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.86","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6056733/05733342.pdf","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Live Virtual Machine Migration via Asynchronous Replication and State Synchronization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5733342/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12315681","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Live Virtual Machine Migration via Asynchronous Replication and State Synchronization","sourcePdf":"ttd2011121986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050242S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6056733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"55","articleId":"5733342","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5733344,"authors":[{"name":"Palden Lama","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6087361/5733344/5733344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Palden Lama received the BTech degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India, in 2003.

In this paper, we address three important challenging problems. First, we propose an efficient server provisioning approach on multitier clusters based on an end-to-end resource allocation optimization model. It is to minimize the number of virtual servers allocated to the system while the average end-to-end response time guarantee is satisfied. Second, we design a model-independent fuzzy controller for bounding an important performance metric, the 90th-percentile response time of requests flowing through the multitier architecture. Third, to compensate for the latency due to the dynamic addition of virtual servers, we design a self-tuning component that adaptively adjusts the output scaling factor of the fuzzy controller according to the transient behavior of the end-to-end response time. Extensive simulation results, using two representative customer behavior models in a typical three-tier web cluster, demonstrate that the provisioning approach is able to significantly reduce the number of virtual servers allocated for the performance guarantee compared to an existing representative approach. The approach integrated with the model-independent self-tuning fuzzy controller can efficiently assure the average and the 90th-percentile end-to-end response time guarantees on multitier clusters.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.88","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6087361/05733344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6087361","startPage":"78","endPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Server Provisioning with Control for End-to-End Response Time Guarantee on Multitier Clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Server Provisioning with Control for End-to-End Response Time Guarantee on Multitier Clusters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12388603","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5733344/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Server Provisioning with Control for End-to-End Response Time Guarantee on Multitier Clusters","sourcePdf":"ttd2012010078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103156S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6087361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6087361","articleId":"5733344","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5733354,"authors":[{"name":"Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6087361/5733354/5733354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou received the diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering (summa cum laude) and the MSc degree in technoeconomics from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

Each user is associated with a nested utility function, which appropriately represents his degree of satisfaction in relation to the expected trade-off between his QoS-aware actual uplink throughput performance and the corresponding power consumption. Initially, a Multiservice Uplink Power Control game (MSUPC) is formulated, where each user aims selfishly at maximizing his utility-based performance under the imposed physical limitations and its unique Nash equilibrium point is determined. Then the inefficiency of MSUPC game's Nash equilibrium is proven and a usage-based convex pricing policy of the transmission power is introduced, which offers a more effective approach compared to the linear pricing schemes that have been adopted in the literature. Consequently, a Multiservice Uplink Power Control game with Convex Pricing (MSUPC-CP) is formulated and its unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium is determined. A distributed iterative algorithm for computing MSUPC-CP game's equilibrium is proposed, while the overall approach's efficiency is illustrated via modeling and simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6087361/05733354.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6087361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Uplink Power Control in Multiservice Wireless Networks via a Game Theoretic Approach with Convex Pricing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733354/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Uplink Power Control in Multiservice Wireless Networks via a Game Theoretic Approach with Convex Pricing","volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12388608","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733354/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Uplink Power Control in Multiservice Wireless Networks via a Game Theoretic Approach with Convex Pricing","sourcePdf":"ttd2012010061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064049S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6087361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6087361","articleId":"5733354","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5733357,"authors":[{"name":"Lubin Kerhuel","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences, Biorobotics Team, National Center of Scientific Research, University of the Mediterranean, Marseilles, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6094080/5733357/5733357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lubin Kerhuel was born in Paris, France.

In the initial version presented here, the sensor relies on the repetitive micro-translation of a pair of photoreceptors set behind a small lens, and on the processing designed to locate a target from the two photoreceptor signals. The VODKA sensor, in which retinal micro-scanning movements are performed via a small piezo-bender actuator driven at a frequency of 40 Hz, was found to be able to locate a contrasting edge with an outstandingly high resolution 900-fold greater than its static resolution (which is constrained by the interreceptor angle), regardless of the scanning law imposed on the retina. Hyperacuity is thus obtained at a very low cost, thus opening new vistas for the accurate visuo-motor control of robotic platforms. As an example, the sensor was mounted onto a miniature aerial robot that became able to track a moving target accurately by exploiting the robot's uncontrolled random vibrations as the source of its ocular microscanning movement. The simplicity, small size, low mass and low power consumption of this optical sensor make it highly suitable for many applications in the fields of metrology, astronomy, robotics, automotive, and aerospace engineering. The basic operating principle may also shed new light on the whys and wherefores of the tremor eye movements occurring in both animals and humans.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6094080/05733357.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2011.2129505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2129505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The VODKA Sensor: A Bio-Inspired Hyperacute Optical Position Sensing Device","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical sensors","Photoreceptors","Robot sensing systems","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Retina","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","microrobots","mobile robots","motion control","optical receivers","optical sensors","piezoelectric actuators","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VODKA sensor","bioinspired hyperacute optical position sensing device","autonomous robot","vibrating optical device","vertebrate animal","invertebrate animal","microtranslation","photoreceptor signal","microscanning movement","piezobender actuator","static resolution","visuo-motor control","robotic platform","aerial robot","robot uncontrolled random vibration","ocular microscanning movement","power consumption","aerospace engineering","tremor eye movement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Astronomy","hyperacuity","metrology","micro aerial vehicle (MAV)","optical sensor","photodiode","photoreceptor","position sensing device (PSD)","robotics","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","vibration","vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"The VODKA Sensor: A Bio-Inspired Hyperacute Optical Position Sensing Device","volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5733357/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12403954","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The VODKA Sensor: A Bio-Inspired Hyperacute Optical Position Sensing Device","sourcePdf":"jsen-kerhuel-2129505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095513S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6094080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6094080","articleId":"5733357","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733359,"authors":[{"name":"Booma Devi Sekar","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6142628/5733359/5733359-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Booma Devi Sekar received the M.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Macau, Macau, in 2007.

However, this approach makes a strong assumption that image patch itself provides a good approximation on the true parameter, which leads to the bias problem particularly under serious speckle noise. Another disadvantage of the BNL filter is that the commonly used patch preselection method cannot effectively exclude the outliers. In this letter, a new form of the BNL filter is presented for the purpose of synthetic aperture radar image despeckling, which incorporates the technique of sigma filter to cope with the bias problem. In addition, pixel preselection is adopted based on the refined sigma range, which greatly contributes to the preservation of the image details such as edges, texture, and the strong reflective scatters.

Neurons can be stimulated and recorded using the same protocol. A novel local cable circuit between neighboring compartments allows one to construct different dendritic morphologies. This chip provides a hardware platform for studying the network behavior of neurons with active dendrites and for investigating the role of different dendritic morphologies in neuronal computation. Based on experimental results from a chip fabricated in a 4-metal, 2-poly, 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS technology, this work shows one instance of how dendritic nonlinearities can contribute to neuronal computation, that is, the dendritic spike mechanism can dynamically reduce the mismatch-induced coefficient of variation of the somatic response amplitude from about 40% to 3.5%, and the response timing jitter by a factor of 2.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2112570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6016553/05733378.pdf","startPage":"2159","endPage":"2171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2112570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Dimensional Configurable Active Silicon Dendritic Neuron Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Dimensional Configurable Active Silicon Dendritic Neuron Array","volume":"58","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12227975","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733378/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733378/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Dimensional Configurable Active Silicon Dendritic Neuron Array","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liu-2112570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093254S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6016553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6016553","articleId":"5733378","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5733382,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6044606/5733382/5733382-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sumit Singh (M'10) received the Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 2002, and the Master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California (UC), Santa Barbara, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He was a Software Engineer with the Network Systems Division, Samsung Electronics, Bangalore, India, from 2002 to 2004.

The links in such networks are highly directional: Because of the small carrier wavelength (an order of magnitude smaller than those for existing cellular and wireless local area networks), narrow beams are essential for overcoming higher path loss and can be implemented using compact electronically steerable antenna arrays. Directionality drastically reduces interference, but it also leads to \u201cdeafness,\u201d making implicit coordination using carrier sense infeasible. In this paper, we make a quantitative case for rethinking medium access control (MAC) design in such settings. Unlike existing MAC protocols for omnidirectional networks, where the focus is on interference management, we contend that MAC design for 60-GHz mesh networks can essentially ignore interference and must focus instead on the challenge of scheduling half-duplex transmissions with deaf neighbors. Our main contribution is an analytical framework for estimating the collision probability in such networks as a function of the antenna patterns and the density of simultaneously transmitting nodes. The numerical results from our interference analysis show that highly directional links can indeed be modeled as pseudowired, in that the collision probability is small even with a significant density of transmitters. Furthermore, simulation of a rudimentary directional slotted Aloha protocol shows that packet losses due to failed coordination are an order of magnitude higher than those due to collisions, confirming our analytical results and highlighting the need for more sophisticated coordination mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2122343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2122343","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1527","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on

The legacy power system visualization tools, however, restrict the visualization process to follow a limited number of pre-defined patterns created by human designers, thus hindering users' ability to discover. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to interactive visualization of power systems. The proposed approach relies on developing powerful data manipulation algorithms to create visualizations based on the characteristics of empirically or mathematically derived data. Based on this approach, a data-driven model exploratory tool has been developed to enable users to visualize the power system's physical/electrical configurations at various levels and from different perspectives. The conducted case studies have demonstrated that the data-driven approach could result in an interactive and user-driven power system visualization tool that fosters scientific understanding and insight, therefore unleashing the power of visualization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Pattern matching","Power system dynamics","Smart grids","Visual analytics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","power engineering computing","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system interactive visualization","information visualization","business practice","electric power industry","legacy power system visualization tool","predefined patterns","data driven interactive visualization","powerful data manipulation algorithms","data driven model","physical configuration","electrical configuration","common information model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common Information Model (CIM)","data-driven","interactive visualization","one-line diagram","pattern matching","power system visualization","situational awareness","Smart Grid","visual analytics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2119499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6048014/05733386.pdf","startPage":"2539","endPage":"2546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6048014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2119499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach to Interactive Visualization of Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach to Interactive Visualization of Power Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733386/","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733386/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12301712","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach to Interactive Visualization of Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhu-2119499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085908S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6048014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6048014","articleId":"5733386","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5733387,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Liu","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Xiong Liu (S'XX) received the B.E. and M.Sc. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006 and 2008 respectively, both in electrical engineering.

The hybrid grid consists of both ac and dc networks connected together by multi-bidirectional converters. AC sources and loads are connected to the ac network whereas dc sources and loads are tied to the dc network. Energy storage systems can be connected to dc or ac links. The proposed hybrid grid can operate in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. The coordination control algorithms are proposed for smooth power transfer between ac and dc links and for stable system operation under various generation and load conditions. Uncertainty and intermittent characteristics of wind speed, solar irradiation level, ambient temperature, and load are also considered in system control and operation. A small hybrid grid has been modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB. The simulation results show that the system can maintain stable operation under the proposed coordination control schemes when the grid is switched from one operating condition to another.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","volume":"2","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12021427","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5733387/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid and Its Coordination Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid and Its Coordination Control","sourcePdf":"tsg-wang-2116162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141987S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5772087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"654","xplore-issue":"5772087","articleId":"5733387","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5733392,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunsoo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunsoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37556866900"},{"name":"Chulhee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chulhee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336714600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"5733392","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":642},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Pixel","Video sequences","Motion estimation","PSNR","Interpolation","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion adaptive deinterlacing","modular neural networks","motion vectors","motion estimation","intra-mode switching","inter-mode switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular neural networks","motion adaptive deinterlacing","motion estimation","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733392","abstract":"In this letter, a motion adaptive deinterlacing algorithm based on modular neural networks is proposed.

To recognize the focused object, we decompose the image into multiple regions, which are described by using three types of visual descriptors. Each descriptor is extracted from a representation of some aspects of local appearance, e.g., a spatially localized texture, color, or geometrical property. Therefore, the focus detection of a region can be achieved by the classification of extracted visual descriptors based on a binary classifier. We employ a boosting algorithm to learn the classifier with a cascade of decision structure. Given a test image, initial segmentation can be achieved using obtained classification results. Finally, we apply a post-processing technique to improve the results by incorporating region grouping and pixel-level segmentation. Experimental evaluation on a number of images demonstrates the performance advantages of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Training","Pixel","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["focused object extraction","low DOF image","depth-of-field image","focused object recognition","visual descriptor","focus detection","binary classifier","boosting algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attention","boosting","image segmentation","low depth-of-field","object segmentation","visual descriptor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6062602/05733401.pdf","startPage":"1571","endPage":"1580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Extract Focused Objects From Low DOF Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Extract Focused Objects From Low DOF Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733401/","volume":"21","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733401/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12328539","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Extract Focused Objects From Low DOF Images","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ngan-2129150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091767S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6062602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6062602","articleId":"5733401","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733402,"authors":[{"name":"Zafar Shahid","affiliation":["Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics, and Microelectronics, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5762411/5733402/5733402-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zafar Shahid received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, and the M.S. degree in image processing from the National Institute of Applied Sciences, Lyon, France, in 2001 and 2007, respectively.

The problem of selective encryption (SE) is addressed along with the compression in the entropy coding modules. H.264/AVC supports two types of entropy coding modules. Context-adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) is supported in H.264/AVC baseline profile and context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) is supported in H.264/AVC main profile. SE is performed in both types of entropy coding modules of this video codec. For this purpose, in this paper the encryption step is done simultaneously with the entropy coding CAVLC or CABAC. SE is performed by using the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm with the cipher feedback mode on a subset of codewords/binstrings. For CAVLC, SE is performed on equal length codewords from a specific variable length coding table. In case of CABAC, it is done on equal length binstrings. In our scheme, entropy coding module serves the purpose of encryption cipher without affecting the coding efficiency of H.264/AVC by keeping exactly the same bitrate, generating completely compliant bitstream and utilizing negligible computational power. Owing to no escalation in bitrate, our encryption algorithm is better suited for real-time multimedia streaming over heterogeneous networks. It is perfect for playback on handheld devices because of negligible increase in processing power. Nine different benchmark video sequences containing different combinations of motion, texture, and objects are used for experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5762411/05733402.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Protection of H.264/AVC by Selective Encryption of CAVLC and CABAC for I and P Frames","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Automatic voltage control","Syntactics","Bit rate","Entropy coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic codes","binary codes","cryptography","entropy codes","variable length codes","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264/AVC","selective encryption","context-adaptive variable length coding","CAVLC","context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding","CABAC","I frames","P frames","bitstream protection","video codec","entropy coding modules","advanced encryption standard","cipher feedback mode","real-time multimedia streaming","heterogeneous networks","handheld devices","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES algorithm","CABAC","CAVLC","selective encryption","stream cipher","video security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast Protection of H.264/AVC by Selective Encryption of CAVLC and CABAC for I and P Frames","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5733402/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972477","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Protection of H.264/AVC by Selective Encryption of CAVLC and CABAC for I and P Frames","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-puech-2129090-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117292S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5762411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5762411","articleId":"5733402","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733403,"authors":[{"name":"Caroline Rougier","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Operations Research, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5762411/5733403/5733403-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Caroline Rougier received the M.S. degree in image processing from the University of Paris 6, Paris, France, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2010.","She is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.

In order to perform layered utility maximization over tiered networks, we propose a joint source-network flow optimization scheme where individual layers of the scalable video stream are imposed on their optimal multicast paths and associated rates for the highest sustainable layered video quality with minimum costs. It sufficiently guarantees that each destination node accesses progressive layered stream in an incremental order, considers network coding across overlapping paths to destination nodes for decent multicast capacity, and addresses the link contention problem during wireless transmission. We formulate the problem into convex programming with the objective to minimize the total rate-distortion variations between layers. Using primal decomposition and the primal-dual approach, we develop a decentralized algorithm with two levels of optimization. The numerical and packet-level results compare extensive performance under different control conditions over coded and non-coded hybrid networks. It demonstrates that the proposed algorithm could actually achieve the max-flow throughput and provide better video quality with optimal layered access for heterogeneous receivers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5762411/05733407.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source and Flow Optimization for Scalable Video Multirate Multicast Over Hybrid Wired/Wireless Coded Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Static VAr compensators","Streaming media","Optimization","Encoding","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","network coding","optimisation","video coding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable video multirate multicast","hybrid wired/wireless coded networks","video quality","traffic performance","layered utility maximization","tiered networks","joint source-network flow optimization","scalable video stream","network coding","multicast capacity","wireless transmission","convex programming","decentralized algorithm","heterogeneous receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-rate multicast","network coding","rate-distortion","resource allocation","scalable video coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source and Flow Optimization for Scalable Video Multirate Multicast Over Hybrid Wired/Wireless Coded Networks","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5733407/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972480","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source and Flow Optimization for Scalable Video Multirate Multicast Over Hybrid Wired/Wireless Coded Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-xiong-2129070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178073S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5762411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5762411","articleId":"5733407","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733413,"authors":[{"name":"Nelly Pustelnik","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge, CNRS-UMR 8049, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Marne-la-Vallee, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5986818/5733413/5733413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nelly Pustelnik (S'09\u2013M'11) was born in Sarlat-la-Can\u00e9da, France.

However, in the context of variational restoration methods, a challenging question remains, namely how to find a good regularizer. While total variation introduces staircase effects, wavelet-domain regularization brings other artefacts, e.g., ringing. However, a tradeoff can be made by introducing a hybrid regularization including several terms not necessarily acting in the same domain (e.g., spatial and wavelet transform domains). While this approach was shown to provide good results for solving deconvolution problems in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, an important issue is to efficiently deal with this hybrid regularization for more general noise models. To solve this problem, we adopt a convex optimization framework where the criterion to be minimized is split in the sum of more than two terms. For spatial domain regularization, isotropic or anisotropic total variation definitions using various gradient filters are considered. An accelerated version of the Parallel Proximal Algorithm is proposed to perform the minimization. Some difficulties in the computation of the proximity operators involved in this algorithm are also addressed in this paper. Numerical experiments performed in the context of Poisson data recovery, show the good behavior of the algorithm as well as promising results concerning the use of hybrid regularization techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2128335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5986818/05733413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2128335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986818","startPage":"2450","endPage":"2462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Proximal Algorithm for Image Restoration Using Hybrid Regularization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Proximal Algorithm for Image Restoration Using Hybrid Regularization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12190227","pubMedId":"21421440","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5733413/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Proximal Algorithm for Image Restoration Using Hybrid Regularization","sourcePdf":"tip-pustelnik-2128335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157159S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5986818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5986818","articleId":"5733413","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733422,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Ndjiki-Nya","affiliation":["Image Processing Department, Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications (Heinrich Hertz Institut), Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5767748/5733422/5733422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patrick Ndjiki-Nya (M'98) received the Dipl.-Ing. title (corr. to M.S degree) and the Ph.D. degree from the Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 1997 and 2008, respectively.","He has developed an efficient method for content-based video coding, which combines signal theory with computer graphics and vision.

The DIBR algorithm can be used in 3-D video applications to synthesize a number of different perspectives of the same scene, e.g., from a multiview-video-plus-depth (MVD) representation. This MVD format consists of video and depth sequences for a limited number of original camera views of the same natural scene. Here, DIBR methods allow the computation of additional new views. An inherent problem of the view synthesis concept is the fact that image information which is occluded in the original views may become visible, especially in extrapolated views beyond the viewing range of the original cameras. The presented algorithm synthesizes these occluded textures. The synthesizer achieves visually satisfying results by taking spatial and temporal consistency measures into account. Detailed experiments show significant objective and subjective gains of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2128862","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5767748/05733422.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"465","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2128862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth Image-Based Rendering With Advanced Texture Synthesis for 3-D Video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Depth Image-Based Rendering With Advanced Texture Synthesis for 3-D Video","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12004896","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5733422/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth Image-Based Rendering With Advanced Texture Synthesis for 3-D Video","sourcePdf":"tmm-ndjikinya-2128862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117391S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5767748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"5767748","articleId":"5733422","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5733428,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Bing Zeng","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China","School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Bing","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37850884000"},{"name":"Yong He","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"He","id":"37272942500"},{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277240200"},{"name":"Chang-Fan Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chang-Fan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533385300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5733428","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":135,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":932},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733428","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the problem of stability of neural networks with time-varying delays.

Standard transmit beamformers require perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and are sensitive to errors in channel estimation. In practice, such errors are inevitable due to finite feedback resources, quantization errors and other physical constraints. Hence, robustness has become a crucial issue recently. Among two popular robust designs, the stochastic approach exploits channel statistics and optimizes the average system performance while the maximin approach considers errors as deterministic and optimizes the worst case performance. The latter usually leads to a very conservative design against extreme (but rare) conditions which may occur at a very low probability. In this paper, we propose a more flexible approach that maximizes the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and takes the extreme conditions into account using the probability with which they may occur. Simulation results show that the proposed beamformer offers higher robustness against channel estimation errors than several popular transmit beamformers.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2129514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5767741/05733434.pdf","startPage":"2773","endPage":"2782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2129514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Constraint Approach for Robust Transmit Beamforming With Imperfect Channel Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733434/","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Constraint Approach for Robust Transmit Beamforming With Imperfect Channel Information","volume":"59","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12006319","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733434/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Constraint Approach for Robust Transmit Beamforming With Imperfect Channel Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-chung-2129514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068791S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5767741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5767741","articleId":"5733434","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5733435,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Hoydis","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5767741/5733435/5733435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jakob Hoydis (S'08) received the Diploma (Dipl.-Ing.) degree in electrical engineering and information technology from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, in 2008.","From May 2008 to April 2009, he was a Research Assistant at the Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University.

The BSs, assumed to be oblivious of the applied codebooks, forward compressed versions of their observations to a central station (CS) via capacity limited backhaul links. The CS jointly decodes the messages from all UTs. Since the BSs and the CS are assumed to have no prior channel state information (CSI), the channel needs to be estimated during its coherence time. Based on a lower bound of the ergodic mutual information, we determine the optimal fraction of the coherence time used for channel training, taking different path losses between the UTs and the BSs into account.

Various approaches have been proposed to decide relay weights for each relay so that they can cooperatively relay signals. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) has been widely adopted as a performance measure in deciding relay weights. In this paper, we adopt the minimum mean square error (MMSE) to decide relay weights as the MMSE criterion can easily allow distributed implementation with local channel state information (CSI). We also discuss the channel estimation at each relay for distributed beamforming and the impact of the channel estimation error.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05733448.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE-Based Distributed Beamforming in Cooperative Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5733448/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"MMSE-Based Distributed Beamforming in Cooperative Relay Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988520","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-Based Distributed Beamforming in Cooperative Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"1346-tc1105-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136008S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5733448","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5733450,"authors":[{"name":"Payam Rabiei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Dallas, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5766667/5733450/5733450-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Payam Rabiei (S'05) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from The Uiversity of Texas at Dallas 2007.

Using outage probability analysis, an upper bound on the allowable PHN level is derived which ensures that the dual-hop outperforms the direct transmission. To improve dual-hop transmission performance in the presence of PHN, we propose a reduced-complexity joint channel and PHN estimator using full-pilot OFDM symbols for AF relay transmission. The proposed approach achieves a lower mean squared error compared to the conventional channel estimator. In addition, we derive a joint data detection and PHN estimation scheme for comb-type data OFDM symbols by modifying the maximum ratio combining metric to account for the effect of PHN at the destination node.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05733450.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of OFDM-Based Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks in the Presence of Phase Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of OFDM-Based Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks in the Presence of Phase Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988522","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5733450/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of OFDM-Based Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks in the Presence of Phase Noise","sourcePdf":"1458-tc1105-rabiei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089955S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5733450","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5733452,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Mathecken","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Pramod Mathecken received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication from Coimbatore Institute of Technology, an autonomous college affiliated to Anna University, India, in 2005.

We see that the capacity and SINR are random variables whose distribution depends on the phase noise and the fading channel. Using a Taylor series approximation, we show that the random variable, characterizing the phase noise, in the performance metrics can be expressed as a sum of correlated gamma variables with rank-deficient square-root normalized covariance matrix. The approximation holds well when the ratio between the subcarrier spacing and the 3dB bandwidth of the oscillator power spectral density is at least one order of magnitude, which for most practical oscillators is the case. In earlier literature, the probability density function of a sum of correlated gamma variables with full-rank square-root normalized covariance matrix was derived. We extend these results to the rank-deficient case and apply them to the random variable of our case. With the probability density functions characterizing the phase noise and the fading channel at hand, we proceed to obtain closed-form statistical measures of capacity and SINR. The simulations show the good agreement with our analytical expressions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05733452.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100401","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of OFDM with Wiener Phase Noise and Frequency Selective Fading Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733452/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of OFDM with Wiener Phase Noise and Frequency Selective Fading Channel","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733452/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"11988524","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of OFDM with Wiener Phase Noise and Frequency Selective Fading Channel","sourcePdf":"1321-tc1105-mathecken.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102634S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5733452","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5733453,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Aurzada","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5766667/5733453/5733453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank Aurzada studied mathematics at the Friedrich-Schiller University, Jena, Germany and the University of York, York, U.K. He received the Dipl.-Math. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from the Friedrich-Schiller University in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

In this paper we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of the capacity (maximum mean packet throughput) and packet delay of subnetworks that can be used to form NG-PONs. Our analysis can cover a wide range of NG-PONs through taking the minimum capacity of the subnetworks forming the NG-PON and weighing the packet delays of the subnetworks. Our numerical and simulation results indicate that our analysis quite accurately characterizes the throughput-delay performance of EPON/GPON tree networks, including networks upgraded with higher data rates and wavelength counts. Our analysis also characterizes the trade-offs and bottlenecks when integrating EPON/GPON tree networks across a metro area with a ring, a Passive Star Coupler (PSC), or an Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) for uniform and non-uniform traffic. To the best of our knowledge, the presented analysis is the first to consider multiple PONs interconnected via a metro network.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05733453.pdf","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Delay Analysis of Next-Generation Passive Optical Networks (NG-PONs)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical network units","Time division multiplexing","Passive optical networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","EPON","Delay","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre LAN","passive optical networks","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next-generation passive optical network","NG-PON","Ethernet passive optical network","Gigabit PON","next-generation PON","probabilistic analysis","maximum mean packet throughput","packet delay","EPON-GPON tree networks","passive star coupler","PSC","arrayed waveguide grating","AWG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metro area network","packet delay","passive optical network","throughput-delay analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Delay Analysis of Next-Generation Passive Optical Networks (NG-PONs)","volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5733453/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988525","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Delay Analysis of Next-Generation Passive Optical Networks (NG-PONs)","sourcePdf":"1378-tc1105-aurzada.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090081S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5733453","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5733454,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5952306/5733454/5733454-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Wu was born in Inner Mongolia, China, in 1981.

Due to the inherent coupling between timing recovery and decoding, most existing studies rely on extensive simulation rather than on analytical methods to evaluate performance of timing recovery for coded systems. We propose analytical methods in this paper towards this end. A first key step is to approximate timing-offset-induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) as an additive Gaussian noise, since in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime the background noise is large enough to mask the ISI. Then, we derive semi-analytical expressions for the mean and variance of extrinsic information as functions of timing offset, building on which we characterize both open-loop and closed-loop performance of decision-directed timing synchronizers. Monte Carlo simulation results corroborate that the proposed method accurately characterizes the performance of CA DD timing recovery, for systems with a wide range of channel bandwidth and different channel codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100449","startPage":"1975","endPage":"1984","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5952306/05733454.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5952306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Code-Aided Symbol Timing Recovery on AWGN Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Code-Aided Symbol Timing Recovery on AWGN Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","volume":"59","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733454/","accessionNumber":"12157780","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733454/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Code-Aided Symbol Timing Recovery on AWGN Channels","sourcePdf":"1975-tc1107-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121769S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5952306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5952306","articleId":"5733454","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5733455,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5766667/5733455/5733455-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Wang received the B.S. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from Michigan Technological University, Houghton, in 2007, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

To limit the decoding latency, we start with a single-pass decoding algorithm, that is, marker code-based synchronization is performed only once per received packet and iterative decoding with information exchange between the inner decoder and outer decoder is not allowed. Through numerical evaluations, we first find the marker code structures which offer the ultimate achievable rate when standard bit-level synchronization is performed. Then, to exploit the correlations in the likelihoods corresponding to different transmitted bits, we introduce a novel symbol-level synchronization algorithm that works on groups of consecutive bits, and show how it improves the achievable rate along with the error rate performance by capturing part of the rate loss due to interleaving. When decoding latency is not an issue and multiple-pass decoding is performed, we utilize extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts to analyze the convergence behavior of the receiver, which leads to design of outer LDPC codes with good degree distributions. Finally, design examples are provided along with simulation results which confirm the advantage of the newly designed codes over the ones optimized for the standard additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, especially for channels with severe synchronization problems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05733455.pdf","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.030411.100546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-Level Synchronization and LDPC Code Design for Insertion/Deletion Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-Level Synchronization and LDPC Code Design for Insertion/Deletion Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733455/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11988526","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5733455/","volume":"59","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-Level Synchronization and LDPC Code Design for Insertion/Deletion Channels","sourcePdf":"1287-tc1105-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08975S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5733455","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5733456,"authors":[{"name":"Mai Vu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mai","lastName":"Vu","id":"37268913400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5733456","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1775},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733456","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Fading","Receivers","Array signal processing","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","channel capacity","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO channel capacity","per-antenna power constraint","optimal signaling scheme","channel state information","transmitter","receiver","Rayleigh fading channel","beamforming","beam weights","channel coefficients","sum power constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Per-antenna power","MISO capacity","MISO wireless","beamforming"]}],"abstract":"We establish in closed-form the capacity and the optimal signaling scheme for a MISO channel with per-antenna power constraint.

As the successful results have been presented in both areas, it is reasonable to begin the study of hardware implementation of adaptive fuzzy logic controllers. We have developed a kind of fuzzy logic systems' self-learning algorithm, and begin to design an AFLC's chip now.

The circuit performs complex-IF signal digitization as well as IF-to-Baseband frequency conversion of multistandard communication channels. It demonstrates the feasibility of digitizing quadrature IF-signals with sampling rates in the range of 100 MHz and an IF set to 3/4 of the sampling frequency. The ADC architecture is based on a quadrature IF sampling and mixing topology followed by I/Q lowpass Sigma-Delta modulators performing spectrally shaped signal quantization at baseband. The prototyped ASIC is aimed for application in multi-mode GSM/WCDMA mobile terminals with channel bandwidths of 200 kHz and 3.84 MHz, respectively.

In this paper, with the assumption that the secondary users operate in a wideband communication system, first the bandwidth of the system is divided into some equal parts that are larger than the coherent bandwidth of the channel, and then the capacity of the channel by considering the secondary user's outage capacity criteria is compared in two structures: one with the use of frequency diversity technique and other without the use of frequency diversity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5733989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05733989.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of opportunistic frequency diversity strategy in cognitive radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5733989/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of opportunistic frequency diversity strategy in cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875424","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of opportunistic frequency diversity strategy in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047708S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5733989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5733990,"authors":[{"name":"Navid Tafaghodi Khajavi","affiliation":["Cognitive Telecommunication Research Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Tafaghodi Khajavi","id":"38558978300"},{"name":"Siavash Sadeghi","affiliation":["Cognitive Telecommunication Research Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Sadeghi","id":"38557304700"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad-Sajad Sadough","affiliation":["Cognitive Telecommunication Research Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad-Sajad","lastName":"Sadough","id":"38556490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5733990","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":832},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Measurement","Blind source separation","Transmitters","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","cognitive radio","radio receivers","radio transmitters","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind spectrum sensing technique","cognitive radio system","cognitive transmitter","signal detection","Kurtosis metric","blind source separation algorithm","receiver operating characteristic curve","ROC curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum Sensing","Cognitive Radio","Blind Source Separation","Random Matrix Theory"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved blind spectrum sensing technique for cognitive radio systems","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5733990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05733990.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5733990","startPage":"13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733990","abstract":"Cognitive radio has been proposed as a key solution for the problem of inefficient usage of spectrum bands. Spectrum sensing is one of the most important issues in each cognitive radio system. Classically-used spectrum sensing techniques require that the cognitive transmitter is not in operation while detecting the presence/absence of the primary signal during the sensing period. In this paper, we propose to use the Kurtosis metric, for blind source separation algorithms with the aim of improving the accuracy of conventional spectrum sensing techniques based on blind source separation. We also introduce a new spectrum sensing framework that combines blind source separation with conventional spectrum sensing techniques. In this way, spectrum sensing can continue to work even when the cognitive transmitter is in operation. Simulation results provided in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the proposed method improves the sensing performance achieved with conventional spectrum sensing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5733990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11875425","htmlLink":"/document/5733990/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An improved blind spectrum sensing technique for cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved blind spectrum sensing technique for cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054012S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5733990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5733991,"authors":[{"name":"Ardalan Alizadeh","affiliation":["Cognitive Telecommunication Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ardalan","lastName":"Alizadeh","id":"38558958400"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad-Sajad Sadough","affiliation":["Cognitive Telecommunication Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad-Sajad","lastName":"Sadough","id":"38556490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5733991","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5733991","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Receivers","Optimization","Array signal processing","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","cognitive radio","concave programming","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power minimization","unidirectional relay networks","cognitive radio capabilities","transmitter","receiver","multiple cognitive radio terminals","signal-to-noise ratio","distributed beamforming","spectrum sensing process","cognitive nodes","semidefinite relaxation techniques","AF relay network","amplify-and-forward relaying","beamforming optimization","nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","one-way relaying","convex optimization","distributed beamforming","relay networks","semidefinite relaxation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5733991","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05733991.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5733991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power minimization in uni-directional relay networks with cognitive radio capabilities","abstract":"In this work, we consider a uni-directional (one way) relay network with a pair of primary transmitter and receiver which are relay-assisted by multiple cognitive radio (CR) terminals. A CR base station is deployed to sense the absence/presence of the primary user based on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the fusion center. The primary network utilizes a two-step one-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme and uses the CRs as its relay nodes. In the first step of AF relaying, the primary transmitter sends its signal to the CRs/relays. A distributed beamforming is then performed in the second step of relaying. In this phase, the CR base station sets the beamforming weights of CR terminals to satisfy the SNR requirements at the primary transmitter and at the CR base station. We aim at minimizing the power dissipated in the cognitive (relay) nodes together with ensuring an accurate spectrum sensing process. This optimization problem is efficiently solved by using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques.

Results revealed that modified algorithms, RLS_type, TAASS and MASS, offer higher performance respect to conventional CCM, respectively. Also RLS_type converges faster and it can cancel the interferences close to the desired signal better. Also the SINR level is higher and BER is less than other methods. However MASS and TAASS have less complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734001","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734001.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734001","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","startPage":"69","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Appropriate CCM-based algorithm for adaptive antenna array beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Appropriate CCM-based algorithm for adaptive antenna array beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734001/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875436","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Appropriate CCM-based algorithm for adaptive antenna array beamforming","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088977S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5734009,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Pourahmadazar","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Pourahmadazar","id":"37542813100"},{"name":"Hamed Shirzad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Shirzad","id":"37542813400"},{"name":"Changiz Ghobadi","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Changiz","lastName":"Ghobadi","id":"37277361200"},{"name":"Javad Nourinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Nourinia","id":"37277358500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734009","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband antennas","Finite element methods","Antenna measurements","Admittance","Transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","frequency selective surfaces","genetic algorithms","microstrip antennas","monopole antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","UWB microstrip monopole antenna","FEM","HFSS","optimization","microstrip cardioid patch monopole antenna","finite element method","ultrawide band monopole antenna","frequency 2.5 GHz to 11 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element methods (FEMs)","piecewise linear approximation","Multi Admittance matrix","UWB antennas","Cardioid"]}],"abstract":"The purposes of this work is the design and optimization of a new form of microstrip cardioid patch monopole antenna with frequency-notched behavior intended to reject the 5-6 GHz frequency band for WLAN/WiMAX compatibility purposes.

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","startPage":"243","endPage":"248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-efficient anomaly detection approach for wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An energy-efficient anomaly detection approach for wireless sensor networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734031/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875466","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy-efficient anomaly detection approach for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05574S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5734038,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However in cooperative approach, in addition to the performance of the user, the impact of user's action on the other users is considered in the user's utility function. Two iterative algorithms are derived by maximizing the utility function of the user in order to estimate transmitter and receiver beamforming vectors.

Using ZF-ZF method together with applying diagonal weight matrices at the relays, it is shown that the overall channel between the multi-antenna source and affiliated multi-antenna destination can be simplified to M independent parallel paths, where M is the number of source and destination antennas. This enables to incorporate power allocation methods proposed for single antenna multiple relay (SAMR) networks in such channel.

Throughput based antenna selection is new. This technique utilizes cross layer information to select k instead of M transmit antennas to maximize the throughput of the system. Throughput based transmit antenna selection is proposed in this paper when truncated selective repeat automatic repeat request (TSR-ARQ) or selective repeat plus go back N automatic repeat request (GBN+SR-ARQ) is applied at data link layer. The throughput of MIMO system with TSR-ARQ or SR+GBN-ARQ at data link layer is derived analytically with MQAM modulation at physical layer. The improvement of whole system throughput with cross layer based antenna selection will be shown in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734042.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross layer transmit antenna selection in MQAM modulation MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","Wireless communication","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","automatic repeat request","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer transmit antenna selection","MQAM modulation MIMO systems","throughput based antenna selection","truncated selective repeat automatic repeat request","selective repeat plus go back automatic repeat request","data link layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna selection","Automatic repeat request","Cross layer information","MIMO channel","Throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cross layer transmit antenna selection in MQAM modulation MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875477","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross layer transmit antenna selection in MQAM modulation MIMO systems","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062333S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5734043,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Shariat","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Lab, School of ECE., Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hassan","lastName":"Shariat","id":"37392347700"},{"name":"Mehrzad Biguesh","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Lab, School of ECE., Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehrzad","lastName":"Biguesh","id":"37266538300"},{"name":"Saeed Gazor","affiliation":["ECE Department, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Gazor","id":"37273433700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734043","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Correlation","Transforms","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay design","MIMO communication systems","SNR maximization","multi-input multi-output communication system","multiple antennas","linear transform matrix","received signal vector","destination node","eigenvectors","correlation matrices","dominant mode excitation","source-to-relay channel enticers","relay-to-destination channel enticers"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication system is considered in which a relay with multiple antennas is used to assist the data transmission from the source to destination. We assume that the relay applies a linear transform matrix on its received signal vector and retransmit the transformed vector to the destination node. We optimize the transform matrix by maximizing the average end-to-end SNR. The relay transfer matrix is related to the eigenvectors of correlation matrices of the two channels. For some special cases, we derive the optimum solution and the best unitary excitation matrix. We show that this solution is applicable in some cases where the instantaneous end-to-end SNR has to be maximized. Interestingly, the optimum transfer matrix is the dominant mode excitation, for the specific case where either the source-to-relay (SR) channel enticers or the relay-to-destination (RD) channel enticers are uncorrelated and have identical variances, i.e., in such a case all the relay power must be dissipated in the direction of dominant eigenvectors of SR and RD channels correlation matrices. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the effect of different relaying matrices on the end-to-end SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay design for SNR maximization in MIMO communication systems","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734043","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734043.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Relay design for SNR maximization in MIMO communication systems","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734043/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875478","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay design for SNR maximization in MIMO communication systems","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080224S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5734044,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Lari","affiliation":["Microwave, Millimeter Wave and Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Lari","id":"37540717000"},{"name":"Abbas Mohammadi","affiliation":["Microwave, Millimeter Wave and Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37265914700"},{"name":"Abdolali Abdipour","affiliation":["Microwave, Millimeter Wave and Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolali","lastName":"Abdipour","id":"37266515300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734044","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Signal to noise ratio","Physical layer","Modulation","Cross layer design","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","antenna arrays","automatic repeat request","MIMO communication","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer design","adaptive modulation","truncated ARQ","MIMO rician channels","automatic repeat request protocol","multi antennas systems","packet error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","Automatic repeat request","Cross layer information","MIMO channel","Packet error rate","Throughput"]}],"abstract":"A cross layer approach based on adaptive modulation and automatic repeat request protocol in multi antennas systems to maximize the overall throughput and guarantee the packet error rate has been presented.

Computer simulations verify that the signal resulting from the proposed transform has less out-of-band radiation (better spectral characteristics), better BER performance, and lower PAPR compared to the previous works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction in peak to average power ratio of OFDM signals using a new Continuous Linear Companding Transform","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734064","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734064.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduction in peak to average power ratio of OFDM signals using a new Continuous Linear Companding Transform","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734064/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875499","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction in peak to average power ratio of OFDM signals using a new Continuous Linear Companding Transform","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088493S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5734065,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Beheshti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Beheshti","id":"38273526600"},{"name":"Mohammad Javad Omidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Javad","lastName":"Omidi","id":"37371383500"},{"name":"Ali Mohammad Doost-Hoseini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Mohammad","lastName":"Doost-Hoseini","id":"38274943300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734065","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receiving antennas","Frequency domain analysis","Equalizers","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain equalization","MIMO-OFDM","doubly selective channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference","interblock interference","basis expansion model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","doubly selective channel","intercarrier interference (ICI)","interblock interference (IBI)","equalization"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems may confront significant intercarrier interference (ICI) when applied in doubly selective channels.

Topological changes in MANETs render routing paths unusable. The multipath routing addresses this problem by providing more than one route to a destination node. Shared links and nodes between paths present common failure points which can disable many or all of the paths. Disjoint path set requires the multiple paths to be link-or node-disjoint. However, selecting an optimal path set is an NP-complete problem. Neural networks have been proposed as computational tools for solving constrained optimization problems. A Noisy Hopfield Neural Network (NHNN) is proposed as a path set selection algorithm in this paper. This algorithm can find either node-disjoint or link-disjoint path set with no extra overhead. This approach is beneficial for mobile ad-hoc networks, since it produces a set of backup paths with high reliability.","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734076","startPage":"496","endPage":"501","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734076.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable disjoint path set selection in mobile Ad-hoc Networks using Noisy Hopfield Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734076/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliable disjoint path set selection in mobile Ad-hoc Networks using Noisy Hopfield Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734076/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11875510","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable disjoint path set selection in mobile Ad-hoc Networks using Noisy Hopfield Neural Network","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063573S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5734077,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmood Allameh Amiri","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Allameh Amiri","id":"37846703100"},{"name":"Hadi Serajzadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Serajzadeh","id":"37860461600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734077","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734077","abstract":"In recent years, the number of web services has proliferated; consequently the number of web services that offer the same services have been increased.

Quality of service in web services consists of various non-functional factors such as execution cost, execution time, availability, successful execution rate, and security. Also clients usually demand more value added services rather than those offered by single web services. Therefore, selecting a composition plan of web services among numerous plans that their quality satisfies client requirements had become and important issue.

The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional CS in image quality for the same compression ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5734115/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875549","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compressed video sensing using adaptive sampling rate","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed video sensing using adaptive sampling rate","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058206S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5734119,"authors":[{"name":"Behshid Behkamal","affiliation":["Web Technology Laboratory, Department of Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Behshid","lastName":"Behkamal","id":"37860411100"},{"name":"Mohsen Kahani","affiliation":["Web Technology Laboratory, Department of Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Kahani","id":"37671069500"},{"name":"Samad Paydar","affiliation":["Web Technology Laboratory, Department of Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Samad","lastName":"Paydar","id":"37297281200"},{"name":"Mahboobeh Dadkhah","affiliation":["Web Technology Laboratory, Department of Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahboobeh","lastName":"Dadkhah","id":"37844920400"},{"name":"Elaheh Sekhavaty","affiliation":["Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Elaheh","lastName":"Sekhavaty","id":"37860411700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734119","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Resource description framework","Publishing","Joining processes","Databases","Couplings","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","pattern classification","publishing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Persian linked data publishing","academic data","Ferdowsi University","Mashhad dataset","problems classification","Web datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linked Data","RDF","Organizational Data","Persian Dataset"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734119","abstract":"This paper discusses the challenges of publishing Persian linked data based on an experience of publishing some academic data from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad dataset.

A NN can be used in different domains (between any pair of MFCC feature extraction blocks). It includes FFT, MEL, LOG, DCT and DELTA domains. Various domains have different complexities and achieve different degrees. A comparative study is done in this paper in order to find the best domain. Furthermore, a set of MLP NNs, instead of one NN, is used to enhance various noise types with different levels of SNRs. In this case, each NN is trained with a special noise type and SNR. The database used in the simulations is created by artificially adding different types of noises from the NOISEX-92 database to a subset of TIMIT speech corpus. Our experiments show that the highest improvement is achievable in LOG domain. It is also shown that although the performance decreases slightly in the DCT domain, the complexity is reduced to one fourth in this domain.","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734123","startPage":"755","endPage":"759","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734123.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust phoneme recognition using MLP neural networks in various domains of MFCC features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Discrete cosine transforms","Speech recognition","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Training","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","multilayer perceptrons","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phoneme recognition","MLP neural networks","multilayer perceptrons","MFCC feature extraction blocks","FFT domain","MEL domain","LOG domain","DCT domain","DELTA domain","signal-to-noise ratio","TIMIT speech corpus","mel-frequency cepstral coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robust speech recognition","MLP neural network","MEL","LOG","DCT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust phoneme recognition using MLP neural networks in various domains of MFCC features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734123/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875557","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust phoneme recognition using MLP neural networks in various domains of MFCC features","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048415S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5734133,"authors":[{"name":"Masomeh Azghani","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Masomeh","lastName":"Azghani","id":"38573318400"},{"name":"Ali Aghagolzadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Aghagolzadeh","id":"37265014400"},{"name":"Sehraneh Ghaemi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Sehraneh","lastName":"Ghaemi","id":"37396058100"},{"name":"Maryam Kouzehgar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Kouzehgar","id":"37394923700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8183-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8184-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734133","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734133","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Gallium","Biological cells","Target tracking","Approximation algorithms","Mathematical model","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent modified mean shift tracking","object tracking","modified mean shift tracking method","genetic algorithm","background elimination method","iteration method","local search tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mean shift tracking","genetic algorithm","background effect elimination."]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734133","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734133.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","startPage":"806","endPage":"811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent modified mean shift tracking using genetic algorithm","abstract":"Object Tracking using mean shift algorithm has gained much attention in recent years due to its simplicity.

In the next step, the genetic algorithm is used as a local search tool to exactly identify the target in a small window around the position obtained from the mean shift algorithm.

The new method is a hybrid optimization algorithm, which employs the combination of the conventional \u03b8-PSO and the shuffled sub-swarms particle optimization (SSPSO) technique. It is known that the \u03b8-PSO algorithm has better optimization performance than standard PSO algorithm, when dealing with some simple benchmark functions. To improve further the performance of the conventional PSO, the SSPSO algorithm has been suggested to increase the diversity of particles in the swarm. The proposed speech enhancement method, called \u03b8-SSPSO, is a hybrid technique, which incorporates both \u03b8-PSO and SSPSO, with the goal of exploiting the advantages of both algorithms. It is shown that the new \u03b8-SSPSO algorithm is quite effective in achieving global convergence for adaptive filters, which results in a better suppression of noise from input speech signal. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithm outperforms the standard PSO, \u03b8-PSO, and SSPSO in a sense of convergence rate and SNR-improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734145","startPage":"873","endPage":"877","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724750/5733987/05734145.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-channel speech enhancement based on a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Speech","Noise","Optimization","Noise measurement","Adaptive filters","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-channel speech enhancement","hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","noisy speech"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Enhancement","Particle Swarm Optimization","Shuffled Sub-Swarm","\u03b8-PSO","Adaptive filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dual-channel speech enhancement based on a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734145/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875579","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-channel speech enhancement based on a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070703S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724750","isNumber":"5733987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724750","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5733987","articleId":"5734145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5734148,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, this approach suffers from weak Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to the more complex encoding system which implements puncturing scheme in order to achieve code rate 1/4. In this paper, we used the proposed asymmetric turbo code system to mitigate the weak BER performance introduced in bit repetition scheme. At the same time, we found that the proposed asymmetric turbo code system could achieve high throughput compared to typical turbo code system used in HSDPA system. The performance of typical turbo code and proposed asymmetric turbo code using bit repetition and puncturing schemes is studied in MIMO HSDPA system using MATLAB simulation and compared. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed asymmetric turbo code system performs better and it provides coding gain of 0.2dB to 0.3dB and the total throughput is also increased up to 10% compared to typical turbo code system in MIMO HSDPA.","doi":"10.1109/IEEEGCC.2009.5734287","publicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE GCC Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE GCC Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729272/5734232/05734287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEEGCC.2009.5734287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734232","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of proposed asymmetric turbo code in WCDMA HSDPA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of proposed asymmetric turbo code in WCDMA HSDPA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734287/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"11875659","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734287/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of proposed asymmetric turbo code in WCDMA HSDPA system","confLoc":"Kuwait, Kuwait","sourcePdf":"1569168957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095382S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5729272","isNumber":"5734232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729272","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5734232","articleId":"5734287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5734289,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The Fourier domain approach was found to be the more suitable way for obtaining the forward and inverse FRAT. This structure has result in a more suitable realization of FFT-based OFDM. It was shown that it increased the orthogonality significantly due to the use of IFFT twice, in the data mapping and in the sub-carrier modulation. As a result, a modification has been performed in this Work by replacing (ID and 2D-FFT) by (ID and 2D-Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)) in FRAT and IFRAT. The proposed structure with OFDM gave a significant improvement in the BER performance in comparison with the conventional OFDM when tested for different channel types. The modified OFDM is more secure than conventional OFDM structure.","doi":"10.1109/IEEEGCC.2009.5734316","publicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE GCC Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE GCC Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729272/5734232/05734316.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEEGCC.2009.5734316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposed realization of modified FRAT based OFDM transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734316/","displayDocTitle":"Proposed realization of modified FRAT based OFDM transceivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"11875688","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734316/","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposed realization of modified FRAT based OFDM transceivers","confLoc":"Kuwait, Kuwait","sourcePdf":"1569169785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0522S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5729272","isNumber":"5734232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729272","xplore-issue":"5734232","articleId":"5734316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5734325,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Roddewig","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Roddewig","id":"37860294900"},{"name":"Seyed A.

By using the two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) present at the AlGaN/GaN interface and the piezoelectric properties of this heterostructure, we use the R-HEMT (Resonant High Electron Mobility Transistor) as an active piezoelectric transducer up to 5MHz. In addition to the amplification effect of piezoelectric detection, we show that the active piezoelectric transduction has a strong dependence with the channel mobility that is controlled by a top gate.

Pneumatic microvalves (pneumatic-FETs) are the active devices in the fluidic circuits, and its SPICE model is required for circuit simulation. The simulation results using the established SPICE model showed very good agreement with the characteristics of the measured circuits. This paper is the first successful demonstration of SPICE simulation in micro fluidic circuits design.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734635","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734635","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 24th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 24th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724748/5734339/05734635.pdf","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1157","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SPICE","Integrated circuit modeling","Microfluidics","Fluidic microsystems","Solid modeling","MOSFET circuits","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","integrated circuit design","microfluidics","microvalves","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic integrated circuits","SPICE simulation","CAD system","electronic circuit design","circuit simulator","LSI technology","pneumatic microvalves","pneumatic-FET"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micro fluidic circuit design with \u201cspice\u201d simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Micro fluidic circuit design with \u201cspice\u201d simulation","htmlLink":"/document/5734635/","accessionNumber":"11875365","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micro fluidic circuit design with \u201cspice\u201d simulation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"2900377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037974S","chronDate":"23-27 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5724748","isNumber":"5734339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724748","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5734339","articleId":"5734635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5734698,"authors":[{"name":"Diwakar Sharma","affiliation":["Samsung India Software Operations Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Diwakar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37849023600"},{"name":"Sriram N.

We show that at moderate to high SNR, the cascaded THP-BD system achieves the same error performance as the system employing THP on a multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink. Also, symbol error rate (SER) of the THP-BD precoding technique is at least 3 dB better than a linear precoding scheme when perfect CSIT is available. We also evaluate the performance of this scheme for channels with noisy feedback and with temporal correlation. Significantly, we find that while THP is sensitive to temporal correlation of the channel, THP-BD is more resilient.","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734698","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734698.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascaded tomlinson harashima precoding and block diagonalization for multi-user MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded tomlinson harashima precoding and block diagonalization for multi-user MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734698/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875821","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734698/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded tomlinson harashima precoding and block diagonalization for multi-user MIMO","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569354789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038117S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5734702,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Zafar Ali Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"lastName":"Mohammed Zafar Ali Khan","id":"37712383600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-091-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-090-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-089-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734702","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734702","abstract":"In this paper we derive conditions under which Spatio-temporal power allocation provides exponential diversity when the quality of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and receiver (CSIR) degrades.

Erlang capacity analysis of traditional cellular systems like Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) cannot be applied to cellular OFDMA because in the latter, each incoming call requires a random number of subcarriers. To address this problem, we divide incoming calls into classes according to their subcarrier requirement. Then, we model the system as a multi-dimensional Markov chain and evaluate the Erlang capacity. We draw an interesting analogy between the problem considered, and the concept of stochastic knapsack, a generalization of the classical knapsack problem. Techniques used to solve the stochastic knapsack problem simplify the analysis of the multi-dimensional Markov chain.","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734706","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Erlang capacity of cellular OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Erlang capacity of cellular OFDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734706/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875829","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Erlang capacity of cellular OFDMA","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569355367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062471S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5734711,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A pilot preamble-based approach is proposed that makes use of the concept of signal decomposition. Earlier works have demonstrated that it is possible to decompose the multidimensional optimization involved in this joint estimation into a series of one-dimensional searches. The alternating projection (AP) algorithm is effectively used to determine the ML solution to this problem in many earlier works. In this work, we propose a new method of signal decomposition that can be combined with the conventional AP method to arrive at better parameter estimates. It achieves better performance in lesser number of estimation cycles and hence with lesser computational load. Another advantage is that it offers the flexibility of application to any generalized subcarrier assignment scheme in OFDMA systems. The performance advantages of this new method are substantiated through simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734722","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734722.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint ML estimation technique for timing, CFO and channel for OFDMA uplink transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734722/","displayDocTitle":"A joint ML estimation technique for timing, CFO and channel for OFDMA uplink transmissions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875845","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734722/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint ML estimation technique for timing, CFO and channel for OFDMA uplink transmissions","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569359241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05402S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5734723,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya K.

This cross-layer content-aware algorithm employs a combination of hard and soft (HS) symbol information from the header blocks of the scalable JPEG compressed image to estimate the complex baseband MIMO wireless channel. The proposed HS-EM scheme can significantly reduce the overhead for communication by avoiding the transmission of dedicated pilot symbols which constitute a considerable overhead in a MIMO wireless system. Further, the unique blend of HS information makes the algorithm ideally suited for scalable image transmission in the fast-fading wireless environment, while it simultaneously avoids the convergence problems typically associated with conventional blind estimation algorithms.

Recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm, namely reactive tabu search (RTS) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based belief propagation (BP) algorithm for low-complexity large-MIMO detection. The motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations on the above two algorithms: i) Although RTS achieved close to optimal performance for 4-QAM in large dimensions, significant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order QAM (e.g., 16-, 64-QAM). ii) BP also achieved near-optimal performance for large dimensions, but only for {\u00b11} alphabet. In this paper, we improve the large-MIMO detection performance of higher-order QAM signals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs RTS and BP. In particular, motivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the RTS output, the least significant bits (LSB) of the symbols are mostly in error, we propose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than LSBs at the RTS output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to the BP algorithm to improve the reliability of the LSBs. The output of the BP is then fed back to RTS for the next iteration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the RTS algorithm, and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and Gaussian tree approximation (GTA) algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid RTS-BP algorithm for improved detection of large-MIMO M-QAM signals","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734727","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734727.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid RTS-BP algorithm for improved detection of large-MIMO M-QAM signals","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734727/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875850","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid RTS-BP algorithm for improved detection of large-MIMO M-QAM signals","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569359441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048986S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5734730,"authors":[{"name":"Hemanth Acharya","affiliation":["Qualcomm India Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Hemanth","lastName":"Acharya","id":"37842382900"},{"name":"Sivakishore Reddy Yerrapareddy","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in Wireless Technology, Chennai, India"],"lastName":"Sivakishore Reddy Yerrapareddy","id":"37860087300"},{"name":"Kiran Kumar Kuchi","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in Wireless Technology, Chennai, India"],"lastName":"Kiran Kumar Kuchi","id":"37442710800"},{"name":"Bhaskar Ramamurthi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Bhaskar","lastName":"Ramamurthi","id":"37375644400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-091-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-090-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-089-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734730","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","OFDM","Downlink","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unitary precoders","CQI reliability","closed loop MU-MIMO OFDM systems","multiuser MIMO","base station","multiusers scheduling","resource allocation","SINR","channel quality information","link adaptation"]}],"abstract":"In Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), the Base Station (BS) schedules multiple users simultaneously on the same resources.

This CQI is used by the BS for link adaptation to the scheduled users.

In this paper, we investigate the joint stream allocation and scheduling problem for single-user MIMO communication in WMNs with the objective of maximizing the demand satisfaction for a set of flows. The notion of transmission configuration (TC) is introduced and a heuristic algorithm is proposed to find a good subset of all possible TCs. Using these TCs, the joint stream allocation and scheduling problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) and a convex program (CP) to obtain the maximum throughput and proportional fair solutions. To find the optimal solutions, we also introduce a scheme to enumerate all possible TCs. The simulation results demonstrate that performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm is very near to the optimal solution. The computational complexity of the proposed heuristic algorithm is substantially less compared to the optimal. In addition, we show that as the number of antennas increases, the demand satisfaction and the network throughput increase linearly.","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734740","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734740.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint stream allocation and scheduling for single-user MIMO communication in WMNs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734740/","displayDocTitle":"Joint stream allocation and scheduling for single-user MIMO communication in WMNs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875862","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734740/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint stream allocation and scheduling for single-user MIMO communication in WMNs","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569359926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073595S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5734745,"authors":[{"name":"Seemanti Saha","affiliation":["G.

In this work, proposed equalization technique reduces the adverse nonlinear distortion effects at receiver in a Rayleigh faded OFDM communication system and a significant improvement in bit error rate (BER) performance is achieved.

Present days' Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems use Multi-Band OFDM (MB-OFDM) techniques for transmission in application like Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). UWB based systems are power limited by the regulation of FCC. CP introduces correlation in the transmitted data sequence and hence introduces ripples in the power spectral density (PSD) of the transmitted data. This in turn reduces the range of data transmission. However, use of zero-pad suffix (ZPS) will have a flat PSD and hence does not suffer from the range degradation problem. In the receiver, ZP removal requires use of a technique called as overlap and add (OLA) in order to capture the multipath energy of the channel and maintain the orthogonality in the received data. During transmission, the length of the ZP is fixed and equal to the channel length. During reception, in traditional OFDM receiver, the OLA is done using a ZP length of same as channel length as transmitted. In UWB receiver the FFT window gets smeared due to multipath fading and hence estimation of true FFT window start point does affect the OLA process and hence the overall system performance. In this paper, we propose a method which adapts OLA length in UWB receiver depending on the current band of reception and the band wise estimated true FFT window start point. The proposed method is more beneficiary for high delay spread channel like channel model 4 (CM4). In CM4, the technique can achieve around 1 dB E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n gain at 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n of BER, while simulated over uncoded MB-OFDM based UWB system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734747.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive overlap-and-add technique in MB-OFDM based UWB receiver design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Delay","Receivers","Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Estimation","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","personal area networks","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive overlap-and-add technique","UWB receiver design","OFDM based transmission system","cyclic prefix","OFDM symbol","orthogonality of transmission","ultra-wideband systems","UWB systems","multiband OFDM","MB-OFDM techniques","wireless personal area network","WPAN","FCC","transmitted data sequence","power spectral density","PSD","data transmission","zero-pad suffix","ZPS","range degradation problem","overlap and add","multipath energy","channel length","OFDM receiver","ZP length","FFT window","multipath fading","OLA length","high delay spread channel","channel model 4","uncoded MB-OFDM based UWB system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive overlap-and-add technique in MB-OFDM based UWB receiver design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875869","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive overlap-and-add technique in MB-OFDM based UWB receiver design","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569360179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048604S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5734748,"authors":[{"name":"Anushree Neogi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Anushree","lastName":"Neogi","id":"37853097900"},{"name":"Abhijit Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37274540400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-091-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-090-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-089-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734748","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","OFDM","Synchronization","Frequency estimation","Time frequency analysis","Bit error rate","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","convolutional codes","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum a-posteriori estimation","blind algorithm","carrier frequency offset estimation","symbol timing offset estimation","convolutionally coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel"]}],"abstract":"We propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) based blind algorithm for carrier frequency offset (CFO) and symbol timing offset (STO) estimation, for a convolutionally coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM) system, in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

Open-loop MU-MIMO (OL-MU-MIMO) is a codebook based precoding technique where precoders are fixed a priori at the base station (BS) in a known fashion and the user needs to feedback which precoding vector is to be chosen referred to as precoding vector index (PVI) or stream indicator. This scheme feedbacks the channel quality indicator (CQI) which is used by the BS for allocation of modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to the scheduled users. As the precoders used at all the base stations are known a priori, estimation of co-channel interference (CCI) is accurate and there is negligible mismatch between the CQI fed back by the user in present frame and SINR experienced by the user during next frame for low Doppler, resulting in stable CQI modeling. In this paper, an extensive study is made on OL-MU-MIMO and open loop single-user MIMO (OL-SU-MIMO), with an emphasis on how OL-MU-MIMO exploits multi-user diversity to achieve high spectral efficiencies. We also derive the SINR and CQI expressions for such MU-MIMO systems, and provide simulation results which indicate that OL-MU-MIMO outperforms OL-SU-MIMO only when there are large number of users in the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of open loop multi-user MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","doi":"10.1109/NCC.2011.5734749","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of open loop multi-user MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734749/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875871","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of open loop multi-user MIMO systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569360265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04819S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5734757,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We compare the theoretical results with simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCC.2011.5734764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5734693","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729276/5734693/05734764.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of data and voice connections in a cognitive radio network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734764/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of data and voice connections in a cognitive radio network","conferenceDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11875885","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of data and voice connections in a cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569365119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07975S","chronDate":"28-30 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5729276","isNumber":"5734693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729276","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5734693","articleId":"5734764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5734765,"authors":[{"name":"A Vijaya Krishna","affiliation":["Department of ECE, P E S Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"A","lastName":"Vijaya Krishna","id":"37860092300"},{"name":"V Shashank","affiliation":["Department of ECE, P E S Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"V","lastName":"Shashank","id":"37860090700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-091-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-090-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-089-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5734765","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Equalizers","MIMO","Delay","Fading","Joints","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel bank filters","equalisers","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual information","filterbank equalization","MIMO frequency selective channels","multiple antennas","multiple input multiple output channels","block transmission model","block processing approach","minimum mean-squared error","MMSE filterbank receiver","joint detection","symbol-wise detection"]}],"abstract":"The use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver is well motivated by the substantial performance gains that can be realized, both in terms of an increase in achievable data rate and a decrease in error rate. The achievable data rate is characterized by the mutual information of the channel. In case of frequency selective multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels, expressions for mutual information are obtained by using a block transmission model. In this paper, we consider a filterbank equalization framework, which is an attractive alternative to the block processing approach. We derive expressions for mutual information with the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) filterbank receiver, for both joint detection and symbol-wise detection. It is shown that the filterbank approach provides much better information rates than the block processing approach.

Formulations for maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of both additive noises and convolutional distortions, and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation of clean speech are derived. Experimental results on Aurora2 and Aurora4 benchmark databases, where the modeling assumption of the distortion model is more accurate, demonstrate that the standard HOVTS-based feature compensation approaches achieve consistently significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to traditional standard first-order VTS-based approach. For a real-world in-vehicle connected digits recognition task on Aurora3 benchmark database where the modeling assumption of the distortion model is less accurate, modifications are necessary to make VTS-based feature compensation approaches work. In this case, the second-order VTS-based approach performs only slightly better than the first-order VTS-based approach.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5989936/05734800.pdf","startPage":"2285","endPage":"2293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Feature Compensation Approach Using High-Order Vector Taylor Series Approximation of an Explicit Distortion Model for Noisy Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2129508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2129508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Feature Compensation Approach Using High-Order Vector Taylor Series Approximation of an Explicit Distortion Model for Noisy Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206165","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Feature Compensation Approach Using High-Order Vector Taylor Series Approximation of an Explicit Distortion Model for Noisy Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-du-2129508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025651S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"5989936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"20","articleId":"5734800","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734801,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The goal of this work is to perform Bayesian sensing and model regularization for heterogeneous training data. By incorporating a prior density on sensing weights, the relevance of different bases to a feature vector is determined by the corresponding precision parameters. The BS-HMM parameters, consisting of the basis vectors, the precision matrices of sensing weights and the precision matrices of reconstruction errors, are jointly estimated by maximizing the likelihood function, which is marginalized over the weight priors. We derive recursive solutions for the three parameters, which are expressed via maximum a posteriori estimates of the sensing weights. We specifically optimize BS-HMMs for large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) by introducing a mixture model of BS-HMMs and by adapting the basis vectors to different speakers. Discriminative training of BS-HMMs in the model domain and the feature domain is also proposed. Experimental results on an LVCSR task show consistent improvements due to the three sets of BS-HMM parameters and demonstrate how the extensions of mixture models, speaker adaptation, and discriminative training achieve better recognition results compared to those of conventional HMMs based on Gaussian mixture models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6066252/05734803.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"54","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2129911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2129911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Sensing Hidden Markov Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Bayesian methods","Sensors","Covariance matrix","Adaptation model","Training","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","hidden Markov models","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood estimation","signal reconstruction","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian sensing hidden Markov models","sequential data","state-dependent basis vectors","heterogeneous training data","BS-HMM parameters","precision matrices","reconstruction errors","maximum a posteriori estimation","large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition","speaker adaptation","Gaussian mixture models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["acoustic model","Bayesian learning","dictionary learning","discriminative training","speaker adaptation","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Sensing Hidden Markov Models","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5734803/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12422878","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Sensing Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"tasl-saon-2129911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082214S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6066252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6066252","articleId":"5734803","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734808,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Lun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6062602/5734808/5734808-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shih-Lun Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

Although the characteristics of human visual system have been incorporated into perceptual-based rate control, most existing schemes do not take rate-distortion optimization into consideration. In this paper, we use the structural similarity index as the quality metric for rate-distortion modeling and develop an optimum bit allocation and rate control scheme for video coding. This scheme achieves up to 25% bit-rate reduction over the JM reference software of H.264. Under the rate-distortion optimization framework, the proposed scheme can be easily integrated with the perceptual-based mode decision scheme. The overall bit-rate reduction may reach as high as 32% over the JM reference software.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Indexes","Rate-distortion","Encoding","Adaptation model","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","mean square error methods","optimisation","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSIM-based perceptual rate control","video coding","video quality","mean squared error method","human perception","human visual system","perceptual-based rate control scheme","structural similarity index","rate-distortion modeling","optimum bit allocation","H.264","JM reference software","perceptual-based mode decision scheme","rate-distortion optimization framework","bit-rate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264/AVC","optimum bit allocation","rate control","rate-distortion optimization","structural similarity index"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5762411/05734810.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSIM-Based Perceptual Rate Control for Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SSIM-Based Perceptual Rate Control for Video Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734810/","volume":"21","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734810/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11972482","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSIM-Based Perceptual Rate Control for Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-chen-2129890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089609S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5762411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5762411","articleId":"5734810","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5734811,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Luo","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5970267/5734811/5734811-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haiyan Luo (S'09) received the B.S. degree from Dalian Jiaotong University (formerly Dalian Railway Institute), Dalian, China, and the M.S. degree from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian.

When used in video applications, user-perceived video quality experienced by secondary users is a very important performance metric to evaluate the effectiveness of CR technologies. However, most of the current research only considers spectrum utilization and effectiveness at medium access control (MAC) and physical layers, ignoring the system performance of the upper layers. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to improve the user experience of secondary users for wireless video services over CR networks. We propose a quality-driven cross-layer optimized system to maximize the expected user-perceived video quality at the receiver end under the constraint of packet delay bound. By formulating network functions such as encoder behavior, cognitive MAC scheduling, transmission, as well as modulation and coding into a distortion-delay optimization framework, important system parameters residing in different network layers are jointly optimized in a systematic way to achieve the best user-perceived video quality for secondary users in CR networks. Furthermore, the proposed problem is formulated into a MIN-MAX problem, and solved by using dynamic programming. The performance enhancement of the proposed system is evaluated through extensive experiments based on H.264/AVC.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5970267/05734811.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Design for the Performance Improvement of Real-Time Video Transmission of Secondary Users Over Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Design for the Performance Improvement of Real-Time Video Transmission of Secondary Users Over Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734811/","volume":"21","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5734811/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205130","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Design for the Performance Improvement of Real-Time Video Transmission of Secondary Users Over Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ci-2129810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092424S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5970267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5970267","articleId":"5734811","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734812,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5970267/5734812/5734812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mei Guo received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2004, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","From 2005 to 2007, she was with Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, as an Intern.

Specifically, we replace predictive Inter coding in H.264/AVC by the syndrome-based coding scheme of Witsenhausen and Wyner, while keeping the Intra and Skip modes of H.264/AVC unchanged. We employ forward motion estimation at the encoder and send the motion vectors to help generate side information at the decoder, since our focus is not on low-complexity encoding. We also examine the tradeoff between the motion vector resolution and coding efficiency. Within the Witsenhausen-Wyner coding mode, we optimize the decision between syndrome coding and entropy coding among different discrete cosine transform (DCT) bands and among different bit-planes within each DCT coefficient. Extensive simulations of video transmission over wireless networks show that Witsenhausen-Wyner video coding is more robust against channel errors than H.264/AVC.

For instance, driving car usually happens outdoors, and kissing involves two people moving toward each other. In this paper, we investigate the problem of context modeling for human action retrieval. We first identify ten simple object-level action atoms relevant to many human actions, e.g., people getting closer. With the action atoms and several background scene classes, we show that action retrieval can be improved through modeling action-scene-object dependency. An algorithm inspired by the popular semi-supervised learning paradigm is introduced for this purpose. One important contribution of this paper is to show that modeling the dependencies among actions, objects, and scenes can be efficiently achieved with very few examples. Such a solution has tremendous potential in practice as it is often expensive to acquire large sets of training data. Experiments were performed on the challenging Hollywood2 dataset containing 89 movies. The results validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a mean average precision of 26% with just ten examples per action.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5762411/05734813.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"681","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2129870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Scene and Object Contexts for Human Action Retrieval With Few Examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Scene and Object Contexts for Human Action Retrieval With Few Examples","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5734813/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972483","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Scene and Object Contexts for Human Action Retrieval With Few Examples","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-jiang-2129870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06522S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5762411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5762411","articleId":"5734813","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5734821,"authors":[{"name":"Minmin Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5783011/5734821/5734821-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minmin Shen received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006.

Similarly, down-sampling before video compression in low bit rate video coding may alleviate the blocking effect and improve peak signal-to-noise ratio of the decoded frames.

The screens are formed by metallic objects of arbitrary shape displaced in a 2-D lattice. The problem is first studied through a full-wave approach, using the array scanning method in conjunction with a periodic method of moments in the spatial domain. Next, the shielding problem is solved analytically in some characteristic electromagnetic compatibility configurations through the use of approximate low-frequency homogeneous models together with a classical analysis in the spectral domain. Finally, the solutions are compared with those deriving from the use of the so-called transmission-line approximation. The provided results show the suitability of the analytical approaches in dealing with finite sources different from standard plane-wave excitations and give a useful tool for the design of periodic shields.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shielding Effectiveness of Periodic Screens Against Finite High-Impedance Near-Field Sources","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2010.2081367","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5986812/05734829.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2010.2081367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986812","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Shielding Effectiveness of Periodic Screens Against Finite High-Impedance Near-Field Sources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5734829/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206176","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shielding Effectiveness of Periodic Screens Against Finite High-Impedance Near-Field Sources","sourcePdf":"temc-araneo-2081367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085766S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5986812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5986812","articleId":"5734829","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734838,"authors":[{"name":"Hern\u00e2ni Goncalves","affiliation":["Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Ci\u00eancias Geo-Espaciais, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5910675/5734838/5734838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hern\u00e2ni Gon\u00e7alves was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1979.

Although a wide variety of AIR methods have been proposed in the last few years, there are several drawbacks which avoid their common use in practice. The recently proposed scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) approach has already revealed to be a powerful tool for the obtention of tie points in general image processing tasks, but it has a limited performance when directly applied to remote sensing images. In this paper, a new AIR method is proposed, based on the combination of image segmentation and SIFT, complemented by a robust procedure of outlier removal. This combination allows for an accurate obtention of tie points for a pair of remote sensing images, being a powerful scheme for AIR. Both synthetic and real data have been considered in this work for the evaluation of the proposed methodology, comprising medium and high spatial resolution images, and single-band, multispectral, and hyperspectral images. A set of measures which allow for an objective evaluation of the geometric correction process quality has been used. The proposed methodology allows for a fully automatic registration of pairs of remote sensing images, leading to a subpixel accuracy for the whole considered data set. Furthermore, it is able to account for differences in spectral content, rotation, scale, translation, different viewpoint, and change in illumination.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Image Registration Through Image Segmentation and SIFT","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2109389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5910675/05734838.pdf","startPage":"2589","endPage":"2600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2109389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910675","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Image Registration Through Image Segmentation and SIFT","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5734838/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12073004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Image Registration Through Image Segmentation and SIFT","sourcePdf":"tgrs-goncalves-2109389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088014S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5910675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"5910675","articleId":"5734838","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734839,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Meola","affiliation":["RYMT, Air Force Research Laboratory, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5910675/5734839/5734839-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joseph Meola (M'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.","He is a Research Engineer with the Electro-Optic Target Detection and Surveillance Branch, Sensors Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.

Interesting changes in imagery typically correspond to changes in material reflectance associated with pixels in the scene. Using a physical model describing the sensor-reaching radiance, change detection can be formulated as a statistical hypothesis test. Complicating the problem of change detection is the presence of shadow, illumination, and atmospheric differences, as well as misregistration and parallax error, which often produce the appearance of change. The proposed physical model incorporates terms to account for both direct and diffuse shadow fractions to help mitigate false alarms associated with shadow differences between scenes. The resulting generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provides an indicator of change at each pixel. The maximum likelihood estimates of the physical model parameters used for the GLRT are obtained from the entire joint data set to take advantage of coupled information existing between pixel measurements. Simulation results using synthetic and real imagery demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Changes in Hyperspectral Imagery Using a Model-Based Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2109726","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5910675/05734839.pdf","startPage":"2647","endPage":"2661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2109726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910675","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Changes in Hyperspectral Imagery Using a Model-Based Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5734839/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12092919","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Changes in Hyperspectral Imagery Using a Model-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tgrs-meola-2109726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150713S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5910675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5910675","articleId":"5734839","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734842,"authors":[{"name":"Irene Amerini","affiliation":["Media Integration and Communication Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5983314/5734842/5734842-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Irene Amerini received the Laurea degree in computer engineering in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering, multimedia, and telecommunication in 2011, both from the University of Florence, Italy.","She was a visiting scholar at Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, in 2010.

This can be a crucial task when images are used as basic evidence to influence judgment like, for example, in a court of law. To carry out such forensic analysis, various technological instruments have been developed in the literature. In this paper, the problem of detecting if an image has been forged is investigated; in particular, attention has been paid to the case in which an area of an image is copied and then pasted onto another zone to create a duplication or to cancel something that was awkward. Generally, to adapt the image patch to the new context a geometric transformation is needed. To detect such modifications, a novel methodology based on scale invariant features transform (SIFT) is proposed. Such a method allows us to both understand if a copy-move attack has occurred and, furthermore, to recover the geometric transformation used to perform cloning. Extensive experimental results are presented to confirm that the technique is able to precisely individuate the altered area and, in addition, to estimate the geometric transformation parameters with high reliability.

We present here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art computer vision for traffic video with a critical analysis and an outlook to future research directions. This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing deployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human operators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct comparison of the proposed algorithms difficult. In addition, evaluation under challenging weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and darkness) would be desirable but is rarely performed. Future work should be directed toward robust combined detectors and classifiers for all road users, with a focus on realistic conditions during evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734852/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12213830","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Computer Vision Techniques for the Analysis of Urban Traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Computer Vision Techniques for the Analysis of Urban Traffic","sourcePdf":"tits-buch-2119372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18099S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6006621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"345","xplore-issue":"6006621","articleId":"5734852","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":5734859,"authors":[{"name":"Ziwei Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6083527/5734859/5734859-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ziwei Ouyang (S'07) received the B.S. degree from the Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China, in 2004, and the M.S degree from the Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.

Integrated magnetics and planar magnetics techniques, therefore, have been an excellent option in order to reduce the counts and the size of magnetic components, hereby increasing the power density of converters. In this paper, a new planar-integrated magnetics (PIM) module for a phase-shift plus duty-cycle-controlled hybrid bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed, which assembles one boost inductor and two transformers into an E-I-E core geometry, reducing the number of parts, the total volume of converter, as well as the total core loss of the magnetic components. AC losses in the windings and leakage inductance of the transformers are kept low by interleaving the primary and secondary turns of the transformers. To verify the validity of the design approach and theoretical analysis, a laboratory prototype employing the PIM module is implemented for a fuel cell application with 20-40-V input voltage and 400-V output voltage. Detailed results from the experimental comparisons demonstrate that the PIM module is fully functional and electromagnetically equivalent to the discrete magnetics and a significant reduction of size can be achieved by using the PIM module.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planar-Integrated Magnetics (PIM) Module in Hybrid Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cell Application","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2129598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6083527/05734859.pdf","startPage":"3254","endPage":"3264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2129598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Planar-Integrated Magnetics (PIM) Module in Hybrid Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cell Application","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5734859/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar-Integrated Magnetics (PIM) Module in Hybrid Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cell Application","sourcePdf":"tpel-ouyang-2129598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12236S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6083527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6083527","articleId":"5734859","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734862,"authors":[{"name":"Yongchang Zhang","affiliation":["Power Electronics andMotor Drive Engineering Center, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China","Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yongchang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405815000"},{"name":"Jianguo Zhu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279939600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"5734862","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":136,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3333},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Stators","Switches","Switching frequency","Mathematical model","Rotors","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine vector control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motor drives","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duty cycle control strategy","torque reduction","flux ripple reduction","permanent magnet synchronous motor drives","switching frequency reduction","switching-table-based direct torque control","torque performance improvement","sinusoidal stator current","PMSM DTC drive","power 1 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Duty cycle","ripple reduction","synchronous motor drives","switching frequency reduction","torque control"]}],"abstract":"Conventional switching-table-based direct torque control (DTC) presents large torque and flux ripples as well as variable switching frequency. Many methods have been proposed to tackle the aforementioned problems, among which duty cycle control is a kind of very effective approach. It is known that by adjusting the duty ratio of the active vector selected from the switching table, the torque ripple can be reduced. However, most of the prior duty cycle control methods only focus on the torque performance improvement and fail to take the flux ripple reduction into account. Furthermore, the methods obtaining the duty ratio are usually complicated and relies heavily on the accuracy of machine parameters, which negates the merits of simplicity and robustness of conventional DTC. This paper proposes a unified switching table to select three vectors rather than two vectors in prior arts; hence, lower flux ripple and more sinusoidal stator current can be obtained while maintaining the torque performance. A very simple but effective method is proposed to obtain the durations of the three vectors. The influence of one-step delay caused by digital implementation is investigated. By arranging the switching sequence of the three vectors appropriately, the switching frequency can be significantly reduced. The superiority of the novel method is confirmed by a comparative study with its counterpart using two vectors only.

Direct therapeutic plasma application as the central field of plasma medicine will bring physical plasmas directly on or in a human (or animal) body. Campus PlasmaMed is a research association supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), concentrated in the northeast of Germany and founded to explore promising and safe applications of atmospheric-pressure plasmas in medical therapy based on systematic and interdisciplinary basic research on the interactions of plasma components with living systems. Whereas a broad spectrum of plasma sources dedicated for biomedical applications has been reported during recent years, mainly two basic principles of plasma sources are used in the Campus PlasmaMed: atmospheric-pressure plasma jets and dielectric barrier discharges. A comprehensive assessment of potential risk factors, such as gas temperature, power transfer from plasma to the target, (V)UV radiation emission, or the generation of toxic gases and its release into the adjacencies, which could be dangerous for patients and therapists, has to be done as a basic precondition before any biomedical experiments can be started or a potential therapeutic application can be taken into consideration. Despite the fact that the initial plasma-source characterization and optimization are in the main responsibility of plasma physicists and engineers, potential users from the biomedical field should be integrated as soon as possible to include special needs and constraints for specific applications during early steps of development. This multidisciplinary research cooperation among plasma scientists and engineers on the one side and life scientists and clinicians on the other is one of the main characteristics of the Campus PlasmaMed. Such interdisciplinary cooperation is more than ever required for the characterization of biological effects of plasma sources, which has to be realized by a multistep program, starting with the investigations of plasma-liquid interactions and including a broad spectrum of in vitro tests with cells, as well as cell and tissue cultures up to isolated tissues or organs to be proved finally with animal experiments and clinical trials. Because there are no standardized criteria so far according to which atmospheric-pressure plasma sources can be assessed as to their suitability for medical applications, interdisciplinary results from plasma medical research have to be transferred into rules and standards to guarantee successful and safe practical application, including economic exploitation of plasma-medical research results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasma sources","Microorganisms","Wounds","Surface treatment","Adhesives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological effects of fields","discharges (electric)","plasma jets","radiation therapy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["campus PlasmaMed","plasma medicine","therapeutic plasma application","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research","plasma sources","atmospheric-pressure plasma jets","dielectric barrier discharge","UV radiation emission","plasma biological effects","plasma-liquid interactions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric-pressure plasmas","biological plasma effects","plasma applications","plasma medicine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPS.2011.2112674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5746831/05734868.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5746831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2011.2112674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Campus PlasmaMed\u2014From Basic Research to Clinical Proof","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Campus PlasmaMed\u2014From Basic Research to Clinical Proof","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734868/","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5734868/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11929472","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Campus PlasmaMed\u2014From Basic Research to Clinical Proof","sourcePdf":"tps-vonwoedtke-2112674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098621S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5746831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5746831","articleId":"5734868","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5734870,"authors":[{"name":"Tiangao Gou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5767741/5734870/5734870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tiangao Gou (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electronic information engineering from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Irvine, in 2009.

The proposed capacitor and operational amplifier (op-amp) sharing techniques merge the front-end sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) and the first multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC1) to achieve low power without an additional reset timing and a memory effect. The second and third MDACs share a single op-amp to reduce power consumption further. A shared op-amp of the merged SHA and MDAC1 controls properly the input trans-conductance for stability at each clock phase of holding and amplifying. The prototype ADC in a 0.18 \u03bc m CMOS process demonstrates the measured differential and integral nonlinearities within 0.53 LSB and 2.09 LSB, respectively.

The information discovery algorithm is represented as a discrete time linear system and the stability of which is analyzed according to average-consensus theorem. According to rigorous stability analysis, convergence of the designed algorithm can be guaranteed. To improve the speed of the algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the coefficients for information exchange so that the second largest eigenvalue of the iteration matrix is minimized. According to the designed algorithm, total net active power and operating status of loads can be discovered accurately even with faults.

The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing. We show that iHEM reduces the expenses of the consumers for each case. Furthermore, we show that packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter of the WSHAN improve as the packet size of the monitoring applications, that also utilize the WSHAN, decreases.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2114678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5772087/05734885.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2114678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772087","startPage":"314","endPage":"325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Cost-Efficient Residential Energy Management in the Smart Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5734885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Cost-Efficient Residential Energy Management in the Smart Grid","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5734885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12021428","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5734885/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Sensor Networks for Cost-Efficient Residential Energy Management in the Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-erolkantarci-2114678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064256S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5772087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"376","xplore-issue":"5772087","articleId":"5734885","onlineDate":"17 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5734886,"authors":[{"name":"Seethalekshmi K.","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5772087/5734886/5734886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seethalekshmi K.

The load shedding requirement in the system has been calculated based on the computed disturbance power as well as the voltage stability condition of the system, with the aid of real-time data, assumed to be available from the synchrophasor based wide area monitoring and control system (WAMCS). This scheme assesses voltage stability based on a dynamic voltage stability criterion, formulated using a Voltage Stability Risk Index (VSRI).

Cluster generation using artificial intelligence may be a potential solution. In this paper recurrent neural network (RNN) based framework for adaptive cluster generation has been proposed. Under RNN, Elman model (Elman RNN) and Jordan model (Jordan RNN) have been employed. The implementation steps of the proposed algorithm, along with the results, have been presented.

However, expensive computing elements are required for the driver circuits which are the key factor of determining the overall performance of FOC-PMSM drives. In addition, an exact direct and quadrature (dq) current is desired for a highly precise driver which can be ensured by an intelligent PI controller. This research proposes an FPGA implementation of current dq PI controller as a part of real-time hardware motion intelligent driver. The outcome will be a single chip current dq PI controller which was previously solved using software and firmware dependent modules. This hardware implementation system can get a high-speed level as well as an exciting precision.

The tracking design was applied in FPGA as rich information of FPGA offers one of the more powerful methods in object tracking. Object tracking system has a very useful application in many real world situations which require object detection. In general, a lot of different algorithms are used in various types of object tracking system such as the detection of handwriting, moving objects, barcodes etc. This project is focusing on shape detection to observe the real object image. This paper starts by describing the method of converting RGB image to binary signal using MATLAB. Then the binary signal is used as an input signal for the detection part. Detection algorithm used in the design is using a fixed method. The simulated waveform shows that the algorithm design can detect the shape correctly if and only if the input image is clear, located in the center of the image and does not flip or rotated. Verification done using FPGA board also proven that. But there are lot of improvement can be done to improve the design such as increasing the size of the binary signal for the input of the system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Pixel","Image reconstruction","Signal processing algorithms","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image colour analysis","object recognition","object tracking","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape pattern recognition","FPGA-based object tracking system","field programmable gate array","object detection","shape detection","red-green-blue image","binary signal","fixed method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","object tracking","shape detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735051","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIE.2010.5735051","startPage":"80","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729855/5735003/05735051.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIE.2010.5735051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735051/","displayDocTitle":"Development of shape pattern recognition for FPGA-based object tracking system","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11875947","htmlLink":"/document/5735051/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of shape pattern recognition for FPGA-based object tracking system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08932S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729855","isNumber":"5735003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729855","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5735003","articleId":"5735051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5735062,"authors":[{"name":"Norulhusna Ahmad","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norulhusna","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"38277779000"},{"name":"S.

The proposed scheme results in enhanced performance because it deals effectively with errors that commonly originate during the feature extraction stage and it accounts for variations due to the individual handwriting performance of different data sets. To overcome the variations in images, each is represented by rotation and scale invariant feature vector known as Pseudo Zernike Moments (PZM). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed classification scheme has been employed in the context of different sets of handwritten Arabic words. The classification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can classify handwritten Arabic word with a error rate less than 10%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729855/5735003/05735068.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIE.2010.5735068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIE.2010.5735068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offline handwritten Arabic words recognition using Zernike moments and Hidden Markov Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Handwriting recognition","Image reconstruction","Support vector machine classification","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","handwritten character recognition","hidden Markov models","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten Arabic word recognition","hidden Markov models","feature extraction","pseudoZernike moments","Arabic word classification scheme","HMM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Offline handwritten Arabic words recognition using Zernike moments and Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11875962","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offline handwritten Arabic words recognition using Zernike moments and Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063609S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729855","isNumber":"5735003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729855","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5735003","articleId":"5735068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5735073,"authors":[{"name":"Sumayyea Salahuddin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sumayyea","lastName":"Salahuddin","id":"37860758400"},{"name":"Maryam Mahsal Khan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Maryam Mahsal","lastName":"Khan","id":"37854314200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9055-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9054-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9053-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5735073","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Genetic programming","Motorcycles","Visualization","Accuracy","Training","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","genetic algorithms","image classification","neural nets","object recognition","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object categorization","Cartesian genetic programming","CGP-evolved artificial neural network","learning model","evolutionary algorithm","affine transformations","image plane","object feature extraction","modified bag of keypoints model","evolutionary network classifiers","NEAT-evolved artificial neural network classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cartesian Genetic Programming","Cartesian Genetic Programming Evolved Artificial Neural Network","Object Categorization","SIFT","Bag of Keypoints"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735073","abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of recognizing object categories by proposing a learning model based on evolutionary algorithm that takes unsegmented, complex images which is tolerant to 2D affine transformations such as scaling and translation in the image plane and 3D transformations of an object such as illumination changes and rotation in depth.

CG generates a heavy load of computation and therefore it slows the performance of the applications using it. Parallelizing CG is considered as a way to increase its performance. However, CG suffers from communication dependencies among its divisible loads. Most of the studies to parallelize CG concentrate on parallelizing its matrix-vector multiplication. In this paper, we answer the following questions: 1) what are the divisible loads in the CG, and 2) where is communication involved in the parallel CG. To answer 1), we highlight the different divisible data blocks in CG. To answer 2), we introduce a dependency graph among the different data blocks. We conduct experiments on a parallel CG implementation and evaluate communication cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5735102/","accessionNumber":"11875995","displayDocTitle":"Communication issues in parallel Conjugate Gradient method using a star-based network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication issues in parallel Conjugate Gradient method using a star-based network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059115S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729855","isNumber":"5735003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5735003","articleId":"5735102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5735103,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Jan Ong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic, University of Nottingham, Semanyih, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jia Jan","lastName":"Ong","id":"37530779200"},{"name":"L.-M.

Although they are also used in monomodal image registration, their performance is not as excellent as that in multimodal registration. In general, the majority of registration methods consist of the following four steps: feature extraction, feature matching, transformation of the models and, finally, resampling the image. It was noted that the accuracy of the registration process depends on matching a feature and control points (CP) detection. Therefore in this paper has been to rely on this feature for magnetic resonance image (MRI) monomodal registration. We have proposed to extract the salient edges and extracted a CP of medical images by using efficiency of multiresolution representation of data nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The MR images were first decomposed using the NSCT, and then Edge and CP were extracted from bandpass directional subband of NSCT coefficients and some proposed rules. After edge and CP extraction, mutual information (MI) was adopted for the registration of feature points and translation parameters are calculated by using particle swarm optimization (PSO). We implement experiments to evaluate the performance of the NTSC and MI similarity measures for 2-D monomodal registration. The experimental results showed that the proposed method produces totally accurate performance for MR image monomodal registration.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIE.2010.5735128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIE.2010.5735128","startPage":"481","endPage":"485","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729855/5735003/05735128.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MR image monomodal registration based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform and mutual information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"MR image monomodal registration based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform and mutual information","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735128/","accessionNumber":"11876020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735128/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MR image monomodal registration based on the nonsubsampled contourlet transform and mutual information","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051335S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729855","isNumber":"5735003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729855","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5735003","articleId":"5735128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5735149,"authors":[{"name":"Azlee Zabidi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Azlee","lastName":"Zabidi","id":"37320486000"},{"name":"Wahidah Mansor","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wahidah","lastName":"Mansor","id":"37320486300"},{"name":"Lee Yoot Khuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lee Yoot","lastName":"Khuan","id":"37322416600"},{"name":"Ihsan Mohd Yassin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ihsan Mohd","lastName":"Yassin","id":"38286220000"},{"name":"Rohilah Sahak","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rohilah","lastName":"Sahak","id":"37320487600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9055-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9054-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9053-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5735149","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Feature extraction","Optimization","Classification algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Pediatrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","channel bank filters","feature extraction","multilayer perceptrons","particle swarm optimisation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete mutative particle swarm optimisation","MFCC computation","hypothyroidal infant cry classification","Mel frequency cepstral coefficients parameters optimization","infant hypothyroidism diagnosis","feature extraction","multilayer perceptron","filter banks","MLP classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization methods","Biom\u00e9dical signal processing","Artificial intelligence","Feedforward neural networks","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735149","abstract":"This paper describes the optimization of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) parameters using Discrete Mutative Particle Swarm Optimization (DMPSO) for diagnosis of hypothyroidism in infants.

We observe a reduction of the threshold of over 20% and up to 80% output power enhancement. These are primarily due to the improved injection efficiency. We developed a diode laser model that includes nonradiative recombination.

The main drawbacks of the conventional PTS (C-PTS) are high computational complexity and transmission of several side information bits. A new PTS with simple detector is proposed in this paper to deal with these drawbacks of C-PTS. The candidates can be generated through cyclically shifting each sub-block sequence in time domain and combining them in a recursive manner. At the receiver, by utilizing the natural diversity of phase constellation for different candidates, the detector can successfully recover the original signal without side information. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed scheme performs very well in terms of PAPR. The probability of detection failure of the side information demonstrates that the detector could work without any side information with high reliability. The proposed scheme achieves almost the same bit error rate (BER) performance as the C-PTS with perfect side information, under both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2011.2122870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5772157/05735170.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2011.2122870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction Using Low Complexity PTS to Construct of OFDM Signals Without Side Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735170/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction Using Low Complexity PTS to Construct of OFDM Signals Without Side Information","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12007505","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735170/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction Using Low Complexity PTS to Construct of OFDM Signals Without Side Information","sourcePdf":"tbc-yang-2122870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084132S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5772157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5772157","articleId":"5735170","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5735180,"authors":[{"name":"Kartik Ganapathi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kartik","lastName":"Ganapathi","id":"37541878600"},{"name":"Sayeef Salahuddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sayeef","lastName":"Salahuddin","id":"37293958100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5735180","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1970},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735180","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tunneling","Logic gates","Heterojunctions","Transistors","Performance evaluation","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ballistic transport","circuit tuning","high electron mobility transistors","tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steep subthreshold swing","high-on-current","heterojunction vertical band-to-band tunneling field-effect transistor","self-consistent ballistic quantum transport simulation","TFET scalability","pocket region","heterojunction barrier height","turn-on steepness","tuning","heterojunction band offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ballistic quantum transport","band-to-band tunneling","heterojunction","steep subthreshold"]}],"abstract":"We propose a heterojunction vertical tunneling field-effect transistor and show using self-consistent ballistic quantum transport simulations that it can provide very steep subthreshold swings and high on current, thereby improving the scalability of TFETs for high performance.

These factors can be engineered by tuning heterojunction band offsets.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2112753","startPage":"689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5755446/05735180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2011.2112753","endPage":"691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5755446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterojunction Vertical Band-to-Band Tunneling Transistors for Steep Subthreshold Swing and High on Current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Heterojunction Vertical Band-to-Band Tunneling Transistors for Steep Subthreshold Swing and High on Current","volume":"32","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5735180/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11961255","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterojunction Vertical Band-to-Band Tunneling Transistors for Steep Subthreshold Swing and High on Current","sourcePdf":"led-ganapathi-2112753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040371S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5755446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5755446","articleId":"5735180","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5735181,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung-Seok Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyung-Seok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37858348000"},{"name":"Dong Seup Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong Seup","lastName":"Lee","id":"38184394000"},{"name":"Tomas Palacios","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Palacios","id":"37270338000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5735181","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":4298},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"This letter reports undoped AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) fabricated with a Si-CMOS-compatible technology based on Ti/Al/W ohmic and Schottky contacts.

Recently, a LDE method using the statistical quantity histogram has achieved good performance, which utilizes the similarity of the arithmetic average of difference histogram (AADH) to reduce the diversity of images and ensure the stable performance of LDE. However, this method is strongly dependent on some assumptions, which limits its applications in practice. In addition, the capacities of the images with the flat AADH, e.g., texture images, are a little bit low. For this purpose, we develop a novel framework for LDE by incorporating the merits from the generalized statistical quantity histogram (GSQH) and the histogram-based embedding. Algorithmically, we design the GSQH driven LDE framework carefully so that it: (1) utilizes the similarity and sparsity of GSQH to construct an efficient embedding carrier, leading to a general and stable framework; (2) is widely adaptable for different kinds of images, due to the usage of the divide-and-conquer strategy; (3) is scalable for different capacity requirements and avoids the capacity problems caused by the flat histogram distribution; (4) is conditionally robust against JPEG compression under a suitable scale factor; and (5) is secure for copyright protection because of the safe storage and transmission of side information. Thorough experiments over three kinds of images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5970267/05735196.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2130410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2130410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless Data Embedding Using Generalized Statistical Quantity Histogram","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Biomedical imaging","Image coding","Receivers","Watermarking","Databases","DH-HEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright","data compression","image coding","image texture","multimedia communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized statistical quantity histogram","histogram-based lossless data embedding","copyright protection","multimedia protection","LDE method","statistical quantity histogram-based embedding","arithmetic average","image diversity","image texture","GSQH driven LDE framework","divide-and-conquer strategy","flat histogram distribution","JPEG compression","information transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized statistical quantity histogram","lossless data embedding","reversibility","video and image watermarking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Lossless Data Embedding Using Generalized Statistical Quantity Histogram","volume":"21","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5735196/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205133","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless Data Embedding Using Generalized Statistical Quantity Histogram","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-li-2130410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106025S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5970267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5970267","articleId":"5735196","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5735207,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Acito","affiliation":["Dipartimento Armi Navali, Accademia Navale, Livorno, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5959279/5735207/5735207-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Acito (M'02) received the Laurea degree (cum laude) in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in \u201cmethods and technologies for environmental monitoring'' from the Universit\u00e1 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","From November 2004 to October 2008, he was a temporary Researcher with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e1 di Pisa.

Noise is described using a parametric model that accounts for the dependence of noise variance on the useful signal. Such model takes into account the photon noise contribution and is therefore suitable for noise characterization in the data acquired by new-generation HS sensors where electronic noise is not dominant. A new algorithm is developed for the estimation of noise parameters which consists of two steps. First, the noise and signal realizations are extracted from the original image by resorting to the multiple-linear-regression-based approach. Then, the model parameters are estimated by using a maximum likelihood approach. The new method does not require the intervention of a human operator and the selection of homogeneous regions in the scene. The performance of the new technique is analyzed on simulated HS data. Results on real data are also presented and discussed. Images acquired with a new-generation HS camera are analyzed to give an experimental evidence of the dependence of random noise on the signal level and to show the results of the estimation algorithm. The algorithm is also applied to a well-known Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data set in order to show its effectiveness when noise is dominated by the signal-independent term.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2110657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5959279/05735207.pdf","startPage":"2957","endPage":"2971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2110657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-Dependent Noise Modeling and Model Parameter Estimation in Hyperspectral Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735207/","displayDocTitle":"Signal-Dependent Noise Modeling and Model Parameter Estimation in Hyperspectral Images","volume":"49","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12121071","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735207/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-Dependent Noise Modeling and Model Parameter Estimation in Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-acito-2110657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079931S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5959279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5959279","articleId":"5735207","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5735208,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard Margarit","affiliation":["Science and Earth Observation Processing Systems Group, GMV AeroSpace and Defense, S.A.U., Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5959279/5735208/5735208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerard Margarit (S'06\u2013M'07) was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1979.

As such, the method tries to overcome the lack of an operational solution that is able to reliably classify ships with one SAR channel. The method has the following three main stages: (1) radar signature isolation; (2) parametric vector (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n) estimation; and (3) decision rule. The first part analyzes the reflectivity histogram of the ship signature to iteratively cluster the pixels of interest. Then, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n is calculated by estimating the values of some macroscale features such as length, breadth, and radar cross section profile along the ship signature. Finally, the decision rule is evaluated with FL so that the measured vector \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n is correlated with the vectors associated with a set of reference categories. These categories have been defined based on user feedback and have been characterized with accurate simulation studies. Specifically, the values of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>\n for each reference ship have been derived with the SAR simulator GRECOSAR. The classification method has been tested with several ENVISAT images acquired for the surroundings of the Strait of Gibraltar. Ground truth has been retrieved via transponder polls, which reveals a preliminary ratio of positive classifications close to 70%. Although this value is not definitive and more tests are needed, it is a good starting point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ship Classification in Single-Pol SAR Images Based on Fuzzy Logic","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2112371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5959279/05735208.pdf","startPage":"3129","endPage":"3138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2112371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Ship Classification in Single-Pol SAR Images Based on Fuzzy Logic","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5735208/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12121072","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ship Classification in Single-Pol SAR Images Based on Fuzzy Logic","sourcePdf":"tgrs-margarit-2112371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069055S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5959279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5959279","articleId":"5735208","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5735213,"authors":[{"name":"Kurt Derr","affiliation":["Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6021400/5735213/5735213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kurt Derr (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, and the M.S. degree in computer science from the University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since 1986, he has worked as a Computer Scientist at the Idaho National Laboratory and began teaching courses as Affiliate Faculty at the University of Idaho in 1987.

This paper focuses on an algorithmic approach for the deployment of a MANET within an enclosed area, such as a building in a disaster scenario, which can provide a robust communication infrastructure for search and rescue operations. While a virtual spring mesh (VSM) algorithm provides scalable, self-organizing, and fault-tolerant capabilities required by a MANET, the VSM lacks the MANET's capabilities of deployment mechanisms for blanket coverage of an area and does not provide an obstacle avoidance mechanism. This paper presents a new technique, an extended VSM (EVSM) algorithm that provides the following novelties: 1) new control laws for exploration and expansion to provide blanket coverage, 2) virtual adaptive springs enabling the mesh to expand as necessary, 3) adapts to communications disturbances by varying the density and movement of mobile nodes, and 4) new metrics to assess the performance of the EVSM algorithm.

Redundancy in the charge and discharge modes of the capacitors is assumed to be adequate for their voltage regulation. However, the effects of the output current of the converter as well as the time duration of the redundant switching states have been neglected. In this paper, the impacts of the connected load to the cascaded H-bridge converter as well as the switching angles on the voltage regulation of the capacitors are studied. This paper proves that voltage regulation is only attainable in a much limited operating conditions that it was originally reported. In addition, based on the analysis of the converter, a simplified formula is found which can be used to find those modulation indices that regulate the voltage of the capacitor. This formula can be used in harmonic minimization problems while capacitor voltage regulation is ensured. Simulation and laboratory results are provided to confirm the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2130501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6011706/05735215.pdf","startPage":"5102","endPage":"5111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2130501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on Capacitor Voltage Regulation in Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Converters With Fundamental Frequency Switching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735215/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on Capacitor Voltage Regulation in Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Converters With Fundamental Frequency Switching","volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216251","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735215/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on Capacitor Voltage Regulation in Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Converters With Fundamental Frequency Switching","sourcePdf":"tie-ferdowsi-2130501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147801S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6011706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6011706","articleId":"5735215","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5735216,"authors":[{"name":"David Gacio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6063570/5735216/5735216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Gacio (S'08) was born in Gij\u00f3n, Spain, in 1983.

Then, the three main PWM dimming schemes found in the literature, that is, enable dimming, series dimming, and parallel dimming, will be briefly discussed. Afterwards, the IBFC topology will be tested performing both analog and enable dimming. In addition, a new proposal is introduced: the high-frequency series PWM dimming technique, which overcomes all the challenges faced when developing PWM dimming capabilities in low slew-rate constant-current fixed-frequency-controlled converters and offers all the advantages of PWM dimming over analog dimming while maintaining good efficiency.

The front-end active-clamp flyback-forward converter has the advantages of zero-voltage-switching performance for all the primary switches, reverse-recovery-problem alleviation for the secondary output diodes, large voltage-conversion ratio, and small input-current ripple. Furthermore, there are two coupled inductors in the proposed converter. Each coupled inductor can work in the flyback mode when the corresponding main switch is in the turn-on state and in the forward mode when it is in the turnoff state, which takes full use of the magnetic core and improves the power density.

In this paper, a novel biologically inspired tracking control approach to real-time navigation of a nonholonomic mobile robot is proposed by integrating a backstepping technique and a neurodynamics model. The tracking control algorithm is derived from the error dynamics analysis of the mobile robot and the stability analysis of the closed-loop control system. The stability of the robot control system and the convergence of tracking errors to zeros are guaranteed by a Lyapunov stability theory. Unlike some existing tracking control methods for mobile robots whose control velocities suffer from velocity jumps, the proposed neurodynamics-based approach is capable of generating smooth continuous robot control signals with zero initial velocities. In addition, it can deal with situations with a very large tracking error. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed neurodynamics-based tracking control of mobile robots are demonstrated by experimental and comparison studies.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2130491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6175217/05735226.pdf","startPage":"3211","endPage":"3220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2130491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6175217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bioinspired Neurodynamics-Based Approach to Tracking Control of Mobile Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Bioinspired Neurodynamics-Based Approach to Tracking Control of Mobile Robots","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5735226/","accessionNumber":"12638395","volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bioinspired Neurodynamics-Based Approach to Tracking Control of Mobile Robots","sourcePdf":"tie-yang-2130491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137388S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6175217","articleId":"5735226","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5735230,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","School of Mathematical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5762843/5735230/5735230-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Zhang was born in Dalian, China.

Additionally, the recognition of 40 CSL sentences is implemented to evaluate our framework for continuous SLR. For gesture-based control, a real-time interactive system is built as a virtual Rubik's cube game using 18 kinds of hand gestures as control commands. While ten subjects play the game, the performance is also examined in user-specific and user-independent classification.

However, over the last decade, as the usage of and demand for radio spectrum has dramatically increased, the disadvantages of fixed allocation policy have become increasingly apparent. As an alternative, various flexible radio spectrum allocation policies have been proposed. In an attempt to contribute to the possibility of adopting dynamic spectrum access as an alternative radio spectrum regulation system, this paper presents on-going research on the sensing and detection of licensed user signals. The paper proposes the adoption of dynamic spectrum access based on cognitive radio technology as an alternative spectrum regulation scheme. It is envisioned that such a scheme will reduce the problems underlying the current spectrum allocation policy without compromising the performance of existing radio systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HISTELCON.2010.5735308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735266","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second Region 8 IEEE Conference on the History of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729271/5735266/05735308.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access as an alternative radio spectrum regulation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5735308/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access as an alternative radio spectrum regulation system","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11876609","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access as an alternative radio spectrum regulation system","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"histelcon201056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068884S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729271","isNumber":"5735266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729271","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5735266","articleId":"5735308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5735345,"authors":[{"name":"Swati Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Swati","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37855059700"},{"name":"Madhuchhanda Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Technology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Madhuchhanda","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37546158800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-038-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-039-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-037-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5735345","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel methodology, based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is developed for extraction of characteristic features from twelve - lead Electrocardiogram recordings.

Followed, by this other fiducial points (Q and S) are detected and QRS onset and offset points are identified. Baseline is also detected and heights of R, Q, S waves are calculated. This, algorithm was validated using PTB diagnostic database giving a sensitivity of 99.6% and MITDB Arrhythmia, giving a sensitivity of 99.8%. The QRS vectors are calculated for normal and patients with Anteroseptal MI and a comparative study is presented. Accordingly, it has been found that classification of normal and AS MI is possible by computing the QRS vector. And a simple classification rule is established for this purpose.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Systems in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724994/5735330/05735345.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Systems in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/ICSMB.2010.5735345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMB.2010.5735345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG feature extraction and classification of anteroseptal myocardial infarction and normal subjects using discrete wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Electrocardiography","Feature extraction","Strontium","Support vector machine classification","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","electrocardiography","feature extraction","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG feature extraction","ECG feature classification","anteroseptal myocardial infarction","discrete wavelet transform","electrocardiogram recording","multiresolution approach","fiducial point","PTB diagnostic database","MITDB Arrhythmia","Anteroseptal MI","QRS vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiresolution","QRS vector","Threshold","Fiducial points"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"ECG feature extraction and classification of anteroseptal myocardial infarction and normal subjects using discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11876515","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG feature extraction and classification of anteroseptal myocardial infarction and normal subjects using discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"0556011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088825S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724994","isNumber":"5735330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724994","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5735330","articleId":"5735345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5735413,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Various signal processing techniques have already been proposed for classification of non-linear and non- stationary signals like EEG. In this work, SVM (support vector machine) based classifier was employed to detect epileptic seizure activity from background electro encephalographs (EEGs). Five types of EEG signals (healthy subject with eye open condition, eye close condition, epileptic, seizure signal from hippocampal region) were selected for the analysis. Signals were preprocessed, decomposed by using discrete wavelet transform DWT till 5th level of decomposition tree. Various features like energy, entropy and standard deviation were computed and consequently used for classification of signals. The results show the promising classification accuracy of nearly 91.2% in detection of abnormal from normal EEG signals. This proposed classifier can be used to design expert system for epilepsy diagnosis purpose in various hospitals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Systems in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5724994/5735330/05735413.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Systems in Medicine and Biology","doi":"10.1109/ICSMB.2010.5735413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMB.2010.5735413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of EEG signal using wavelet transform and support vector machine for epileptic seizure diction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Adaptation model","Biological system modeling","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computational modeling","Computers","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic expert systems","discrete wavelet transforms","electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG signal classification","support vector machine","feature extraction","electroencephalogram","SVM based classifier","epileptic seizure activity","background EEG","discrete wavelet transform","decomposition tree","expert system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electroencephalogram (EEGs)","Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)","Epileptic","Seizure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Classification of EEG signal using wavelet transform and support vector machine for epileptic seizure diction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735413/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11879304","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of EEG signal using wavelet transform and support vector machine for epileptic seizure diction","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"40540875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060064S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5724994","isNumber":"5735330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5724994","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5735330","articleId":"5735413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5735472,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehwan Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Image Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5735469/5735472/5735472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaehwan Jeon was born in Seoul, Korea in 1982.

DCT has a low computational complexity due to real-valued coefficients, and a small number of coefficients have to be calculated to achieve a good spectral representation of an image. The focusing region of an input image is divided into nonoverlapping 8 \u00d7 8 sub-images, and spectra of sub-images are obtained by 8 \u00d7 8 DCT. The focusing measure is computed from the middle frequency components. By appropriately chosen DCT coefficients, the proposed focusing measure is robust to Gaussian and impulsive noises.

Broadband wireless systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) often require an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to produce multiple subcarriers. In this paper, we present the efficient implementation of a pipeline FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications. Our design adopts a single-path delay feedback style as the proposed hardware architecture. To eliminate the read-only memories (ROM's) used to store the twiddle factors, the proposed architecture applies a reconfigurable complex multiplier and bit-parallel multipliers to achieve a ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor, thus consuming lower power than the existing works. The design spends about 33.6K gates, and its power consumption is about 9.8mW at 20MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5735469/05735479.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2011.5735479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2011.5735479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power 64-point pipeline FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Pipelines","Computer architecture","OFDM","Read only memory","Discrete Fourier transforms","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","broadband networks","fast Fourier transforms","low-power electronics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","broadband wireless systems","4G communication","low-power 64-point pipeline FFT/IFFT processor","inverse fast Fourier transform","multiple subcarriers","single-path delay feedback","twiddle factors","reconfigurable complex multiplier","bit-parallel multipliers","ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor","power consumption","frequency 20 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","IFFT","OFDM","complex multiplier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"A low-power 64-point pipeline FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications","volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5735479/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11874842","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power 64-point pipeline FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications","sourcePdf":"p0040-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05998S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5735469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5735469","articleId":"5735479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5735482,"authors":[{"name":"Chongjoon You","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5735469/5735482/5735482-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chongjoon You received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009.

The spectrum sensing detects the presence of a primary user (service) on an associated spectrum. The accuracy of spectrum sensing depends on both sensing time and number of sensing nodes (i.e. secondary users) participating in the sensing process. We derive optimal number of secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing to minimize spectrum detection error probability and optimal spectrum sensing time to maximize data transmission throughput. A system model which consists of a primary TV spectrum and multiple Wi-Fi secondary users is considered. The proposed CR scheme can solve recent spectrum shortage problem in Wi-Fi networks due to traffic explosion by smart phones. We propose K-out-of-N-rule which is the most efficient cooperative sensing rule by analytical and numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","volume":"57","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11874845","publicationDate":"February 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735482/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative TV spectrum sensing in cognitive radio for Wi-Fi networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative TV spectrum sensing in cognitive radio for Wi-Fi networks","sourcePdf":"p0062-you.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054185S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5735469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5735469","articleId":"5735482","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5735483,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Young Pyun","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communication Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5735469/5735483/5735483-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae-Young Pyun (M'03) received a B.S. degree from Chosun University, an M.S. degree from Chonnam University, and a Ph.D. degree from Korea University, Korea, in Electronics Engineering, in 1997, 1999, and 2003, respectively.

The Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) is capable of providing high data rate and flexible Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms. However, one of killer applications, mobile streaming video service from mobile station (MS) to fixed internet network can't still avoid a traditional QoS degradation problem caused by unreliable mobile channel environment. The previous researches show that streaming video service based on downward cross-layer design over OFDMA channel has improved robust features to channel errors, but requires modifications of the existing schedulers, packet ordering, and channel allocation strategies in base station (BS). Now, our goal is that we develop a high error resilient and robust method to channel errors on the OFDMA mobile video device without the modification of conventional functions in WiMAX BS. In this paper, we introduce OFDMA channel aware error resilient video coding method using an upward cross-layer design. Through the extensive simulation results, we prove that the proposed channel-aware intra-refresh coding can recover video damages more efficiently than traditional intra-refresh one over OFDMA channel environment. This error resilience feature can be adapted to all types of streaming video server devices.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2011.5735483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5735469/05735483.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2011.5735483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA channel aware error-resilient mobile streaming video service over mobile WiMAX","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735483/","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA channel aware error-resilient mobile streaming video service over mobile WiMAX","volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11874846","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735483/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA channel aware error-resilient mobile streaming video service over mobile WiMAX","sourcePdf":"p0068-pyun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053714S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5735469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5735469","articleId":"5735483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5735484,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Zeifman","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Center of Sustainable Energy Systems, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Michael I.

This manual work slows down the production and increases the cost of a final production line. This paper proposes an automatic system which will perform all required verification steps on the final production line such that manual work will be minimized, speed of the production will significantly increase and the cost of the final production line will decrease. The proposed final production line uses the camera to capture the image shown on the TV screen which improves the earlier solution with the grabber to allow verification of the image quality as seen by the user. The proposed system consists of: (1) TV set being verified, (2) camera to capture the content on the TV screen, (3) signal generator, (4) test monitoring system and (5) PC which runs the algorithm for extraction of the TV screen content and comparison with the referent content. The proposed algorithm uses the block-based normalized cross-correlation to compare captured and referent content. The proposed testing methodology divides the verification on the final production line in three steps: (1) setup phase, during which the TV set is brought and connected to the signal sources and test monitoring system, (2) execution phase which captures the content on the TV screen and runs the PC algorithm and (3) test report phase which reports the pass/fail result of the test in the test monitoring system. The experimental results of the block-based comparison method show a better sensitivity to small differences than the non-block-based method. The time required for verification step increased by a factor of 5 when using the automatic approach on the final production line instead of a manual one.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2011.5735506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5735469/05735506.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2011.5735506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic black box testing of television systems on the final production line","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735506/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic black box testing of television systems on the final production line","volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11874867","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735506/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic black box testing of television systems on the final production line","sourcePdf":"p0224-katona.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107896S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5735469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5735469","articleId":"5735506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5735512,"authors":[{"name":"Ericson Chua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5735469/5735512/5735512-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ericson G.

The existing electricity grids are rapidly evolving into smart grids by utilizing the advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Meanwhile, advances in Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) battery technologies have made manufacturing of PHEVs cost-wise effective, and PHEVs are expected to be widely adopted in the following years. PHEVs have several benefits over conventional vehicles such as, less fuel dependency, lower operating costs and lower amount of CO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n emissions. On the other hand, unless PHEVs are powered by off the grid renewable energy resources, they will be drawing electricity from the grid to charge their batteries and they will increase the load on the grid. In the worst case, when the Time Of Charging (TOC) coincides with the critical peak periods, the grid may experience overall or partial failure. For most of the cases, TOC may be during the peak hours when the price of electricity is high. To avoid endangering grid resilience and to avoid high costs, a charging strategy and communication with the smart grid is essential. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based charging scheme which receives dynamic pricing information by wireless communications, predicts the market prices during the charging period and determines an appropriate TOC with low cost. Our prediction-based charging scheme is based-on a simple, light-weight classification technique which is suitable for implementation on a vehicle or a charging station. We show that prediction-based charging provides less operating cost and less CO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n emissions.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735676.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction-based charging of PHEVs from the smart grid with dynamic pricing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735676/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction-based charging of PHEVs from the smart grid with dynamic pricing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883432","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735676/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction-based charging of PHEVs from the smart grid with dynamic pricing","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p1032erolkantarci.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049655S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5735689,"authors":[{"name":"Kok-Lim Alvin Yau","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Kok-Lim Alvin","lastName":"Yau","id":"37683359300"},{"name":"Peter Komisarczuk","affiliation":["School of Computing and Technology, Thames Valley University, UK","School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Komisarczuk","id":"37411435400"},{"name":"D.

A Distributed Cognitive Radio Network (DCRN) is a distributed wireless network established by a number of unlicensed users in the absence of fixed network infrastructure such as a base station. Context awareness and intelligence are the capabilities that enable each unlicensed user to observe and carry out its own action as part of the joint action on its operating environment for network-wide performance enhancement. These capabilities can be applied in various application schemes in CR networks such as Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), congestion control, and scheduling. In this paper, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL), including single-agent and multi-agent approaches, to achieve context awareness and intelligence. Firstly, we show that the RL approach achieves a joint action that provides better network-wide performance in respect to DCS in DCRNs. The multi-agent approach is shown to provide higher levels of stability compared to the single-agent approach. Secondly, we show that RL achieves high level of fairness. Thirdly, we show the effects of network density and various essential parameters in RL on the network-wide performance.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing network performance in Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks using single-agent and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing network performance in Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks using single-agent and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735689/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883445","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5735689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing network performance in Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks using single-agent and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p152yau.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099906S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5735702,"authors":[{"name":"Emna Salhi","affiliation":["ATNET Research Team, IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Emna","lastName":"Salhi","id":"37393116000"},{"name":"Samer Lahoud","affiliation":["ATNET Research Team, IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Samer","lastName":"Lahoud","id":"37562978000"},{"name":"Bernard Cousin","affiliation":["ATNET Research Team, IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Cousin","id":"37282296400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8389-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8387-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8388-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"5735702","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Topology","Optimization","Network topology","Measurement","Computational modeling","Delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","computerised monitoring","integer programming","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monitor location cost","network anomaly detection cost","cost-effective systems","for network performance monitoring","monitoring cost model","total monitoring cost"]}],"abstract":"Achieving cost-effective systems for network performance monitoring has been the subject of many research works over the last few years. Most of them adopt a two-step approach. The first step assigns optimal locations to monitors, whereas the second step selects a minimal set of paths to be monitored. However, such an approach does not consider the trade-off between the optimization objectives of each step, and hence may lead to sub-optimal usage of network resources and biased measurements. In this paper, we propose to evaluate and reduce this trade-off. Toward this end, we come up with two ILP formulations for a novel monitoring cost model that apply for both passive and active monitoring. The aim is to jointly minimize the monitor location cost and the anomaly detection cost, thereby obtaining a monitoring solution that minimizes the total monitoring cost. Simulation results illustrate the interplay between the optimization objectives and evaluate the quality of the obtained monitoring solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint optimization of monitor location and network anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735702","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735702.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint optimization of monitor location and network anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735702/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883458","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint optimization of monitor location and network anomaly detection","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p204salhi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038498S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5735749,"authors":[{"name":"Vidarshana Bandara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Vidarshana","lastName":"Bandara","id":"37846976800"},{"name":"Ali Pezeshki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Pezeshki","id":"38576068300"},{"name":"P.

This approach is applied to Internet2 traffic measurements to evaluate the time duration and spatial spread (number of links affected) of anomalies. Based on the empirical results, a node model is proposed that captures the behavior of anomalies at individual network nodes. The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction. As extensions, the model is applied over a path and an aggregated model that applies to a neighborhood in the network is also presented. A method to use the graph wavelet components found during the analysis to implement a real-time anomaly monitoring system is also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling spatial and temporal behavior of Internet traffic anomalies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735749","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735749.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modeling spatial and temporal behavior of Internet traffic anomalies","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735749/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883505","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling spatial and temporal behavior of Internet traffic anomalies","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p384bandara.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053745S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5735752,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Braga","affiliation":["Departamento de Ci\u00eancia da Computa\u00e7\u00e0o, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Braga","id":"37850006600"},{"name":"Edjard Mota","affiliation":["Departamento de Ci\u00eancia da Computa\u00e7\u00e0o, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Edjard","lastName":"Mota","id":"37347299700"},{"name":"Alexandre Passito","affiliation":["Departamento de Ci\u00eancia da Computa\u00e7\u00e0o, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Passito","id":"37565702400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8389-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8387-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8388-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"5735752","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":369,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":7363},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735752","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Feature extraction","Neurons","Computer crime","IP networks","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","file servers","Internet","self-organising feature maps","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OpenFlow","distributed denial-of-service flooding attack detection","Internet security problem","public Web server","traffic flow feature","NOX platform","programmatic interface","switch information handling","flow analysis","self-organizing map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Security","Programmable Networks","Artificial Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks became one of the main Internet security problems over the last decade, threatening public web servers in particular. Although the DDoS mechanism is widely understood, its detection is a very hard task because of the similarities between normal traffic and useless packets, sent by compromised hosts to their victims. This work presents a lightweight method for DDoS attack detection based on traffic flow features, in which the extraction of such information is made with a very low overhead compared to traditional approaches. This is possible due to the use of the NOX platform which provides a programmatic interface to facilitate the handling of switch information. Other major contributions include the high rate of detection and very low rate of false alarms obtained by flow analysis using Self Organizing Maps.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735752","startPage":"408","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735752.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection using NOX/OpenFlow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735752/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection using NOX/OpenFlow","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11883508","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5735752/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection using NOX/OpenFlow","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p408braga.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059952S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"369","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5735777,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Almi'ani","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Almi'ani","id":"37659662500"},{"name":"Anastasios Viglas","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Viglas","id":"37284454800"},{"name":"Lavy Libman","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lavy","lastName":"Libman","id":"37265548700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8389-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8387-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8388-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"5735777","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"abstract":"Several studies in recent years have considered the use of mobile elements for data gathering in wireless sensor networks, so as to reduce the need for multi-hop forwarding among the sensor nodes and thereby prolong the network lifetime. Since, typically, practical constraints preclude a mobile element from visiting all nodes in the sensor network, the solution must involve a combination of a mobile element visiting a subset of the nodes (cache points), while other nodes communicate their data to the cache points wirelessly. This leads to the optimization problem of minimizing the communication distance of the sensor nodes, while keeping the tour length of the mobile element below a given constraint. Several algorithms in existing literature have tackled this problem by separating the construction of the mobile element tour from the computation of the forwarding trees to the cache points. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that alternates between these phases and iteratively improves the outcome of each phase, based on the result of the other. We compare the resulting performance of our algorithm with that of previous work, and show that it closes a considerable portion of the gap from the theoretical optimal solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735777.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient data gathering with tour length-constrained mobile elements in wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Mobile communication","Wireless sensor networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Mobile computing","Energy consumption","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimisation","mobile radio","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient data gathering","tour length-constrained mobile element","wireless sensor network","multihop forwarding","optimization problem","communication distance minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","data gathering","mobile sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient data gathering with tour length-constrained mobile elements in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883533","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient data gathering with tour length-constrained mobile elements in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p582almiani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064356S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5735780,"authors":[{"name":"Ramon Bauza","affiliation":["Uwicore, Ubiquitous Wireless Communications Research Laboratory, University Miguel Hern\u00e1dez, Elche, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Bauza","id":"37846822200"},{"name":"Javier Gozalvez","affiliation":["Uwicore, Ubiquitous Wireless Communications Research Laboratory, University Miguel Hern\u00e1dez, Elche, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Gozalvez","id":"37266421600"},{"name":"Joaquin Sanchez-Soriano","affiliation":["Operations Research Center, University Miguel Hern\u00e1dez, Elche, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Sanchez-Soriano","id":"38271051500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8389-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8387-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8388-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"5735780","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2376},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Roads","Estimation","Monitoring","Fuzzy sets","Frequency estimation","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","road safety","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle communication","traffic safety","road network performance","intelligent transportation system","traffic information","CoTEC","coperative traffic congestion detection","fuzzy logic","road traffic congestion detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative vehicular communications","vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications","traffic congestion detection"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative vehicular systems are being developed to improve traffic safety and management.

To achieve this goal, cluster members must select a member that has the potential to be a clusterhead longer than other cluster members. Our method aims to select a clusterhead based on the lane where most of the traffic will flow.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735785.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using traffic flow for cluster formation in vehicular ad-hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735785/","displayDocTitle":"Using traffic flow for cluster formation in vehicular ad-hoc networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11903173","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735785/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using traffic flow for cluster formation in vehicular ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p631almalag.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049907S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5735804,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Iyanda","lastName":"Sulyman","id":"37265095300"},{"name":"Yousef Al-Zahrani","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Al-Zahrani","id":"38275897800"},{"name":"Saeed Al-Dosari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Al-Dosari","id":"38270801100"},{"name":"Abdulhameed Al-Sanie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Abdulhameed","lastName":"Al-Sanie","id":"38269957600"},{"name":"Saleh Al-Shebeili","affiliation":["Prince Sultan Advanced Technologies Research Institute/STC-Chair, KSU, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Saleh","lastName":"Al-Shebeili","id":"38275055400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8389-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8387-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8388-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"5735804","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Error analysis","Constellation diagram","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage constellation partition algorithm","MIMO","multiple input multiple output","MLD algorithm","maximum likelihood detection","signal detection","CP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reduced-complexity MIMO systems","MIMO-MLD algorithm","Constellation Partition"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the analysis of a constellation-partition (CP) algorithm for multiple input multiple output-maximum likelihood detection (MIMO-MLD) system.

We design WSN-Control, an architecture to control a WSN from an external server connected to the Internet. Within such architecture, we implement a compression and recovery technique that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Compressive Sensing (CS) to reconstruct signals with many components from a sensor field through the collection of a relatively small number of samples, i.e., through incomplete representations of the actual signal. Overall, our experimental results show that a careful use of CS recovery is effective and can lead to a fully automated system for data gathering and reconstruction of real world and non-stationary signals in WSNs. In detail, WSN-Control effectively recovers signals showing some temporal and/or spatial correlation, from a relatively small number of samples, even below 20%, keeping the relative reconstruction error smaller than 5 \u00b7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n. Signals with more irregular and quickly varying statistics are also recovered, even though the reconstruction error becomes highly dependent on the number of collected samples. CS minimization is obtained through the recently proposed NESTA optimization algorithm. Our implementation of CS recovery is available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5729427/5735635/05735834.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Local Computer Network Conference","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2010.5735834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2010.5735834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5735834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WSN-Control: Signal reconstruction through Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Signal reconstruction","Servers","Correlation","Principal component analysis","Monitoring","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","optimisation","principal component analysis","signal reconstruction","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WSN-Control","signal reconstruction framework","compressive sensing","wireless sensor networks","Internet","compression technique","recovery technique","principal component analysis","data gathering","NESTA optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor Networks","Compressive Sensing","Data Gathering","Signal Reconstruction","Nesterov Minimization","Nesta"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5735834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"WSN-Control: Signal reconstruction through Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5735834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883589","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WSN-Control: Signal reconstruction through Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"p921quer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088548S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5729427","isNumber":"5735635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5729427","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5735635","articleId":"5735834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5735985,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering School, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xin Zhao was born in Chizhou, China, on October 1983.

Reversible circuits are currently on the top approaches to power minimization with its application in all-optical-based systems. Fredkin gate is a very common reversible logic gate. In this paper, a modification of the Fredkin gate is proposed. All-optical circuit of this modified Fredkin gate (MFG) is also designed using semiconductor optical amplifier on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer switch. A 16-Boolean logical operational circuit is also shown using this MFG. The main advantage of this scheme is that we can design a 15-Boolean logical function using a single MFG unit. Only one operation (nand) required two MFG units. Hence, complexity of the circuit can be reduced. Also, multivalued T-gate circuit using MFG is proposed.","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/6158729/05737751.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6158729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2011.2106111","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2011.2106111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737751","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical switches","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic gates","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","optical logic","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all optical modified Fredkin gate","digital circuits","reversible circuits","power minimization","all optical-based systems","reversible logic gate","semiconductor optical amplifier","Mach-Zehnder interferometer switch","16-Boolean logical operational circuit","multivalued T-gate circuit","NAND"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-optical switch","Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer","multivalued logic (MVL)","nonlinear optics","reversible logic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Modified Fredkin Gate","accessionNumber":"12577076","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","publicationDate":"March-April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5737751/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Modified Fredkin Gate","sourcePdf":"jstqe-chattopadhyay-2106111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099228S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6158729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6158729","articleId":"5737751","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5737760,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper proposes a novel sparse common spatial pattern (SCSP) algorithm for EEG channel selection. The proposed SCSP algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem to select the least number of channels within a constraint of classification accuracy. As such, the proposed approach can be customized to yield the best classification accuracy by removing the noisy and irrelevant channels, or retain the least number of channels without compromising the classification accuracy obtained by using all the channels. The proposed SCSP algorithm is evaluated using two motor imagery datasets, one with a moderate number of channels and another with a large number of channels. In both datasets, the proposed SCSP channel selection significantly reduced the number of channels, and outperformed existing channel selection methods based on Fisher criterion, mutual information, support vector machine, common spatial pattern, and regularized common spatial pattern in classification accuracy. The proposed SCSP algorithm also yielded an average improvement of 10% in classification accuracy compared to the use of three channels (C3, C4, and Cz).","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2131142","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical

brief evaluates the use of terrain, vehicle speed, and trip distance preview to increase the fuel economy of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Access to future information is classified into full, partial, or no future information and for each case an energy management strategy with the potential for a real-time implementation is proposed. With full knowledge of future driving conditions, dynamic programming (DP) provides a best-achievable benchmark. A partial preview level has access to future trip terrain and requires velocity estimation. Equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is deployed as an instantaneous real-time minimization strategy with parameters adjusted by estimated future driving conditions and obtained either from DP or from a backward solution of ECMS. To reduce the requirement for future velocity and detailed terrain information, another partial preview level only assumes known trip distance to the next charging station and elevation changes (if available). In this level, the parameter of the real-time ECMS is estimated based on the remaining trip distance, the battery's state-of-charge, and elevation changes if included. The results are evaluated against cases with no preview. Results from a number of simulation case studies indicate that the fuel economy can be substantially enhanced with only partial preview.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5737780/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12494300","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Route Preview in Energy Management of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Route Preview in Energy Management of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tcst-zhang-2115242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103442S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6141198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6141198","articleId":"5737780","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5737781,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Khalil","affiliation":["Electroscience Laboratories, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5765527/5737781/5737781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Waleed Khalil received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E degrees from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, in 2008.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, ElectroScience Laboratory, The Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus.

This paper presents an all-digital frequency-locked loop (ADFLL)-based frequency synthesizer with a built-in frequency-shift keying modulator for MICS and industrial-scientific-medical band applications. Unlike all-digital phase-locked loops that rely on a power-hungry time to digital converter, the proposed ADFLL employs a high-resolution single-bit \u03a3\u0394 frequency discriminator in the feedback path and a noise-cancelling \u03a3\u0394 phase-accumulator-based frequency controller in the reference path, achieving fractional resolution with low power consumption. The loop compensation is implemented digitally using an infinite impulse response filter followed by a digital-intensive current-steering DAC driving a ring-oscillator-based voltage-controlled oscillator. The ADFLL achieves 9.5-Hz frequency resolution, spanning the ISM 400-410-MHz band. A worst case near-integer spur of -62 dBc and a phase noise of -83 dBc/Hz at 300-kHz offset are measured.

The technique uses the reconfigurability feature of FPGAs to perform self-characterization and extract the unique timing of the FPGA building blocks over the space of possible inputs. The characterization circuit is then exploited for constructing a physically unclonable function (PUF). The PUF can accept different forms of challenges including pulsewidth, digital binary, and placement challenges. The responses from the PUF are only verifiable by entities with access to the unique timing signature. However, the authentic device is the only entity who can respond within a given time constraint. The constraint is set by the gap between the speed of PUF evaluation on authentic hardware and simulation of its behavior. A suite of authentication protocols is introduced based on the time-bounded mechanism. We ensure that the responses are robust to fluctuations in operational conditions such as temperature and voltage variations by employing: 1) a linear calibration mechanism that adjusts the clock frequency by a feedback from on-chip temperature and voltage sensor readings, and 2) a differential PUF structure with real-valued responses that cancels out the common impact of variations on delays.

Features like graceful degradation or the support of the 3-D experience in a backwards-compatible way are enabled. The reason is that parts of the media stream are more important than others with each part itself providing a useful media representation. Typically, the decoding of some parts of the bitstream is only possible, if the corresponding more important parts are correctly received. Hence, unequal error protection (UEP) can be applied protecting important parts of the bitstream more strongly than others. Mobile broadcast systems typically apply forward error correction (FEC) on upper layers to cope with transmission errors, which the physical layer FEC cannot correct. Today's FEC solutions are optimized to transmit single layer video. The exploitation of the dependencies in layered media codecs for UEP using FEC is the subject of this paper. The presented scheme, which is called layer-aware FEC (LA-FEC), incorporates the dependencies of the layered video codec into the FEC code construction. A combinatorial analysis is derived to show the potential theoretical gain in terms of FEC decoding probability and video quality. Furthermore, the implementation of LA-FEC as an extension of the Raptor FEC and the related signaling are described. The performance of layer-aware Raptor code with SVC is shown by experimental results in a DVB-H environment showing significant improvements achieved by LA-FEC.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Media","Decoding","Encoding","Static VAr compensators","Digital video broadcasting","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital multimedia broadcasting","error correction codes","media streaming","mobile communication","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layer aware forward error correction","layered media format","scalable video coding","multiview video coding","mobile TV services","media stream","unequal error protection","mobile broadcast systems","forward error correction","physical layer FEC","layered media codecs","layer aware FEC","combinatorial analysis","FEC decoding probability","video quality","layer aware Raptor code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LA-FEC","layered media","mobile TV","MVC","SVC","UEP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2129499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5767748/05737793.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2129499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layer-Aware Forward Error Correction for Mobile Broadcast of Layered Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Layer-Aware Forward Error Correction for Mobile Broadcast of Layered Media","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737793/","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5737793/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12004899","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layer-Aware Forward Error Correction for Mobile Broadcast of Layered Media","sourcePdf":"tmm-hellge-2129499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088234S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5767748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5767748","articleId":"5737793","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5737796,"authors":[{"name":"Long Cheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5762843/5737796/5737796-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Long Cheng (S'07\u2013M'09) received the B.S. degree (with honors) in control engineering from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in July 2004, and the Ph.D. degree (with honors) in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in July 2009.","He is an Assistant Professor at the Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligent Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, since July 2009.

Since the objective function and inequality constraints may not be smooth, the Clarke's generalized gradients of the objective function and inequality constraints are employed to describe the dynamics of the proposed neural network. It is proved that the equilibrium point set of the proposed neural network is equivalent to the optimal solution of the original optimization problem by using the Lagrangian saddle-point theorem. Under weak conditions, the proposed neural network is proved to be stable, and the state of the neural network is convergent to one of its equilibrium points. Compared with the existing neural network models for non-smooth optimization problems, the proposed neural network can deal with a larger class of constraints and is not based on the penalty method. Finally, the proposed neural network is used to solve the identification problem of genetic regulatory networks, which can be transformed into a non-smooth convex optimization problem. The simulation results show the satisfactory identification accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2109735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5762843/05737796.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2109735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762843","startPage":"714","endPage":"726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network for Non-Smooth Convex Optimization Problems With Application to the Identification of Genetic Regulatory Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network for Non-Smooth Convex Optimization Problems With Application to the Identification of Genetic Regulatory Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11973884","pubMedId":"21427022","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5737796/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Neural Network for Non-Smooth Convex Optimization Problems With Application to the Identification of Genetic Regulatory Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-cheng-2109735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159684S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5762843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"5762843","articleId":"5737796","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5737797,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuele Grossi","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5876025/5737797/5737797-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emanuele Grossi (M'08) was born in Sora, Italy, on May 10, 1978.

The same min-max solution applies to many commonly adopted performance measures, such as the average signal-to-disturbance ratio, the linear minimum mean square error in estimating the target response, the mutual information between the received signal echoes and the target response, and the approximation of the detection probability in the high- and low-signal regimes for a fixed probability of false alarm. Examples illustrating the behavior of the min-max codes are provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Waveform Design for MIMO Radars","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2131138","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5876025/05737797.pdf","startPage":"3262","endPage":"3271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2131138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Waveform Design for MIMO Radars","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5737797/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12060248","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Waveform Design for MIMO Radars","sourcePdf":"tsp-grossi-2131138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106247S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5876025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5876025","articleId":"5737797","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5737798,"authors":[{"name":"Xijing Guo","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN), CNRS, Nancy Universit\u00e8, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France","Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xijing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37858607400"},{"name":"Sebastian Miron","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN), CNRS, Nancy Universit\u00e8, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Miron","id":"37704451700"},{"name":"David Brie","affiliation":["Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN), CNRS, Nancy Universit\u00e8, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Brie","id":"37281644400"},{"name":"Shihua Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281408500"},{"name":"Xuewen Liao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuewen","lastName":"Liao","id":"37530409700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5737798","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1063},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Perspective on Uniqueness of DOA Estimation Using a Vector Sensor Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737798","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Vectors","Matrix decomposition","Data models","Loading","Tensile stress","Direction of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CANDECOMP/PARAFAC","DOA estimation","vector sensor array","uniqueness problem","passive sensor array","multiple invariances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CANDECOMP/PARAFAC uniqueness","identifiability","polarization","vector sensor array processing"]}],"abstract":"We address the uniqueness problem in estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple narrowband and fully polarized signals impinging on a passive sensor array composed of identical vector sensors.

However, there are two common challenges we need to answer before we can apply nonvolatile memory as main memory practically. First, nonvolatile memory has limited write/erase cycles compared to DRAM. Second, a write operation is slower than a read operation on nonvolatile memory. These two challenges can be answered by reducing the number of write activities on nonvolatile main memory. In this paper, we proposed two optimization techniques, write-aware scheduling and recomputation, to minimize write activities on nonvolatile memory. With the proposed techniques, we can both speed up the completion time of programs and extend nonvolatile memory's lifetime. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques can reduce the number of write activities on nonvolatile memory by 55.71% on average. Thus, the lifetime of nonvolatile memory is extended to 2.5 times as long as before on average. The completion time of programs can be reduced by 56.67% on systems with NOR Flash memory and by 47.63% on systems with NAND Flash memory on average.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737850/","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5737850/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11874895","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Write Activity Minimization for Nonvolatile Main Memory Via Scheduling and Recomputation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Write Activity Minimization for Nonvolatile Main Memory Via Scheduling and Recomputation","sourcePdf":"tcad-hu-2097307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122701S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5737840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5737840","articleId":"5737850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5737851,"authors":[{"name":"Jongeun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5737840/5737851/5737851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongeun Lee (S'01\u2013M'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science, all from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997, 1999, and 2004, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea.

While compiler approaches have the potential to mitigate the effect of soft errors with minimal runtime overheads, static vulnerability estimation-an essential part of compiler approaches-is lacking due to its inherent complexity. This paper presents a static analysis approach for register file (RF) vulnerability estimation. We decompose the vulnerability of a register into intrinsic and conditional basic-block vulnerabilities. This decomposition allows us to develop a fast, yet reasonably accurate RF vulnerability estimation mechanism. We validate and compare a linear equation based method and an iterative method. Also we demonstrate a practical application of RF vulnerability estimation to compiler optimizations. Our experimental results on benchmarks from MiBench suite indicate that not only our static RF vulnerability estimation is fast and accurate, but also compiler optimizations enabled by our static estimation can achieve very cost-effective protection of register files against soft errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5737840/05737851.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2095630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2095630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5737840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static Analysis of Register File Vulnerability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Radio frequency","Estimation","Hardware","Equations","Optimization","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","iterative methods","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static analysis","register file vulnerability","soft errors","technology scaling","earth bound applications","register file","RF","linear equation based method","iterative method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Architectural vulnerability factor","compilers","embedded systems","partially protected register file","soft error","static analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Static Analysis of Register File Vulnerability","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5737851/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11874896","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Analysis of Register File Vulnerability","sourcePdf":"tcad-lee-2095630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113115S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5737840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5737840","articleId":"5737851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5737852,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Chun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5737840/5737852/5737852-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Chun Li (M'08) was born in 1977.

Traditionally, CMOS driver is simplified as a linear circuit in which a constant resistance is used to approximate the nonlinear and time-varying MOS resistance, which is inaccurate for signal integrity analysis in high-speed interconnect systems. This paper proposes a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)-based method for transient analysis of lossy transmission lines in the presence of the nonlinear behavior of CMOS gates. The conventional FDTD with second-order accuracy is used for interconnect analysis and the parameters with frequency-dependent losses are also included. The nonlinear behavior of CMOS gates is represented by alpha-power law model, with the drain current described by piecewise linear function of the drain voltage and discretized in time domain for the FDTD implementation. Explicit forms of the boundary conditions are derived from the implicit interface equations and hence the stability is strictly constrained by Courant condition. Experimental results show that the proposed method has good accuracy and high efficiency with respect to HSPICE. Therefore, it is useful for accurate prediction of time delay and crosstalk noise in high-speed interconnect systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5737840/05737852.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2095650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2095650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5737840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Analysis of CMOS-Gate-Driven - Interconnects Based on FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","CMOS integrated circuits","Time domain analysis","Logic gates","Power transmission lines","Semiconductor device modeling","Finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","delay circuits","finite difference time-domain analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","piecewise linear techniques","SPICE","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient analysis","deep submicron technology","time delay","crosstalk noise","complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-gate-driven RLGC interconnect","linear circuit","constant resistance","time-varying MOS resistance","nonlinear MOS resistance","signal integrity analysis","high-speed interconnect system","finite-difference time-domain-based method","lossy transmission line","CMOS gate","frequency-dependent loss","alpha-power law model","drain current","piecewise linear function","drain voltage","discrete time domain","implicit interface equation","Courant condition","HSPICE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)","device models","interconnect","multiconductor transmission lines","noise analysis","signal integrity","timing analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Transient Analysis of CMOS-Gate-Driven <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$RLGC$</tex></formula> Interconnects Based on FDTD","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5737852/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11874897","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Analysis of CMOS-Gate-Driven <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$RLGC$</tex></formula> Interconnects Based on FDTD","sourcePdf":"tcad-li-2095650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110293S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5737840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5737840","articleId":"5737852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5737854,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Cong","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5737840/5737854/5737854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jason Cong (S'88\u2013M'90\u2013SM'96\u2013F'00) received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1985, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Urbana, in 1987 and 1990, respectively, all in computer science.","Currently, he is a Chancellor's Professor with the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the Director of Center for Domain-Specific Computing (funded by NSF Expeditions in Computing Award), UCLA, and the Co-Director of the Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Laboratory, UCLA, where he was also the Department Chair from 2005 to 2008.

Despite the unsuccessful adoptions of early generations of commercial high-level synthesis (HLS) systems, we believe that the tipping point for transitioning to HLS msystem-on-chip design complexityethodology is happening now, especially for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) designs. The latest generation of HLS tools has made significant progress in providing wide language coverage and robust compilation technology, platform-based modeling, advancement in core HLS algorithms, and a domain-specific approach. In this paper, we use AutoESL's AutoPilot HLS tool coupled with domain-specific system-level implementation platforms developed by Xilinx as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-art C-to-FPGA synthesis solutions targeting multiple application domains. Complex industrial designs targeting Xilinx FPGAs are also presented as case studies, including comparison of HLS solutions versus optimized manual designs. In particular, the experiment on a sphere decoder shows that the HLS solution can achieve an 11-31% reduction in FPGA resource usage with improved design productivity compared to hand-coded design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","volume":"30","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11874899","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5737854/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Level Synthesis for FPGAs: From Prototyping to Deployment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Level Synthesis for FPGAs: From Prototyping to Deployment","sourcePdf":"tcad-zhang-2110592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.245463S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5737840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"404","xplore-issue":"5737840","articleId":"5737854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5737865,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Matsutani","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5737840/5737865/5737865-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroki Matsutani (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.A., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2004, 2006, and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

Since only the router components that are transferring a packet are activated, the leakage power of the on-chip network can be reduced to a near-optimal level. However, such techniques inherently increase the communication latency and degrade the application performance, since a certain amount of wakeup latency is required to activate the sleeping components. To mitigate this wakeup latency, an early wakeup method that can preliminarily detect the next packet arrival and activate the corresponding components is essential. We designed and implemented an ultrafine-grained power-gating router using a commercial 65 nm process. We propose four early wakeup methods and combine them with the power-gating router. The proposed router with the early wakeup methods is evaluated in terms of its application performance, area overhead, and leakage power reduction taking into account the on/off energy overhead. The simulation results showed that it reduces the leakage power by 54.4-59.9% on average even when the application programs are fully running, at the expense of 4.6% of the area and 0.7-3.7% of the performance overheads when we assume a 1 GHz operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5737840/05737865.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2110470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2110470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5737840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance, Area, and Power Evaluations of Ultrafine-Grained Run-Time Power-Gating Routers for CMPs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","System-on-a-chip","Latches","Routing","Program processors","Logic gates","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","network routing","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrafine-grained run-time power-gating routers","CMP","power evaluations","chip multiprocessors","area evaluations","performance evaluations","virtual-channel buffer","virtual-channel multiplexer","crossbar multiplexer","output latch","on-chip network","leakage power","communication latency","wakeup latency","sleeping components","early wakeup method","packet arrival","area overhead","leakage power reduction","on-off energy overhead","size 65 nm","frequency 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power","on-chip networks","power gating","router architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance, Area, and Power Evaluations of Ultrafine-Grained Run-Time Power-Gating Routers for CMPs","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5737865/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11874900","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance, Area, and Power Evaluations of Ultrafine-Grained Run-Time Power-Gating Routers for CMPs","sourcePdf":"tcad-matsutani-2110470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112933S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5737840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5737840","articleId":"5737865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5737889,"authors":[{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5769516/5737889/5737889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Husheng Li (S'00-M'05) received the BS and MS degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2007, he worked as a senior engineer at Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA.

The service interruption can incur significant delays for secondary users' data packets which are considered as secondary customers. Therefore, a secondary customer needs to decide whether to join the queue or leave for other means of transmission. It is shown that the individually optimal strategy for joining the queue is characterized by a threshold of queue length. When the current queue length is above this threshold, the secondary customer should leave; otherwise it should join the queue. The socially optimal threshold of queue length is also obtained and is numerically shown to be smaller than the individually optimal one, which implies that the individually optimal strategy does not yield the socially optimal one. To bridge the gap between the individually and socially optimal strategies, a pricing mechanism is proposed to toll the service of each secondary customer, thus equalizing the two optimal strategies. When the channel statistics are unknown, an online learning procedure, based on the Kiefer-Wolfowitz algorithm, is proposed. The proposed algorithms are then demonstrated using numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007239","htmlLink":"/document/5737889/","displayDocTitle":"Socially Optimal Queuing Control in Cognitive Radio Networks Subject to Service Interruptions: To Queue or Not to Queue?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Socially Optimal Queuing Control in Cognitive Radio Networks Subject to Service Interruptions: To Queue or Not to Queue?","sourcePdf":"1656-tw1105-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080045S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5737889","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5737891,"authors":[{"name":"Farzad Moghimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5769516/5737891/5737891-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farzad Moghimi (S'08) received the B.Sc. degree from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran in 2008, both in electrical engineering.

Coherent correlation based spectrum sensing techniques can exploit these known symbols but fail to utilize the energy contained in the data symbols. In this paper, we propose a hybrid coherent/energy detection scheme for spectrum sensing which exploits both the pilot and the data symbols transmitted by the primary user. Since the complexity of the globally optimal hybrid detection metric is very high, we develop a simple locally optimal hybrid metric, which turns out to be a linear combination of an energy detection metric and a correlation metric. We derive the probabilities of false alarm and missed detection of the proposed hybrid detector, and investigate the asymptotic behavior of both quantities for low signal-to-noise ratio and large sample size assuming that the CR network is optimized using a Neyman-Pearson framework. Simulation and analytical results confirm that the hybrid metric outperforms both energy detection and coherent detection even if the positions of the pilot symbols are not known a priori.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","volume":"10","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"12007241","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5737891/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Coherent/Energy Detection for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Coherent/Energy Detection for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1594-tw1105-moghimi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098415S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5737891","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5737894,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Ho Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5769516/5737894/5737894-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shang-Ho (Lawrence) Tsai received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), USA, in Aug. 2005.

The implementational advantages make EGT a promising solution for simple transceiver design while offering a performance comparable to that of MRT. This solution motivates us to explore how close the performance can be between EGT and MRT. The maximum SNR loss between EGT and MRT is known to be 1.05 dB in MISO channels. However, little is known about the SNR loss in MIMO channels, since no closed-form solution is available for the best EGT in MIMO channels. In this work, a suboptimal closed-form EGT design for MIMO channels is proposed and its performance is analyzed. Interestingly, the maximum SNR loss between the proposed EGT and the MRT (both employing MRC in receiver) in MIMO channels is shown to be approximately 1.05 dB as well. Moreover, instead of applying conventional all transmit antennas, this study proposes to adopt antenna selection, to further improve the performance of EGT. Two antenna selection algorithms are proposed and the corresponding performance is analyzed. When the proposed antenna selection algorithms are applied to EGT, the SNR loss between EGT and MRT can be reduced to as low as 0.45-0.65 dB, with the numbers of transmit antennas ranging from 4 to 8. One of the proposals with fixed number of transmit antennas not only outperforms conventional EGT but also requires fewer number of RF (radio frequency) components; also, it employs constant power in each transmit antenna like EGT does. As a result, hardware complexity can be reduced by this proposal. Furthermore, design strategies to apply the proposed EGT and antenna selection algorithms in systems with limited feedback are also suggested.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05737894.pdf","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030411.100410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030411.100410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equal Gain Transmission with Antenna Selection in MIMO Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","Approximation methods","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","MIMO communication","radiocommunication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equal gain transmission","MIMO communication","beamforming vector","maximum ratio transmission","transceiver design","SNR loss","MIMO channel","antenna selection algorithm","transmit antenna","radio frequency component","hardware complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equal gain transmission","EGT","hybrid selection","(transmit) antenna selection","TAS","beamforming","precoding","MRT","Lloyd codebook","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Equal Gain Transmission with Antenna Selection in MIMO Communications","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5737894/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007244","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equal Gain Transmission with Antenna Selection in MIMO Communications","sourcePdf":"1470-tw1105-tsai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080131S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5737894","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5737895,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Performance assessment of multi-cell systems based on these technologies is of crucial importance in the deployment of broadband wireless standards such as WiMAX and 3GPP LTE. In this paper, we define an analytical framework for the assessment of the average error probability of multi-cell bit-interleaved convolutionally-coded MIMO-OFDMA systems. Both coordinated and randomized multi-user access strategies are considered for interference mitigation. In such a scenario, the analytical framework must account for the correlation of the fading channel over the space-frequency domain and possible non-stationary features of the multicell interference (due to subcarrier randomization). The analysis is carried out for different multi-antenna strategies, ranging from beamforming systems for mitigation of out-of-cell directional interference to spatial diversity schemes based on orthogonal space-time coding. Numerical results corroborate the proposed analytical framework for heterogeneous environments and a wide range of system configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05737895.pdf","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030411.100453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030411.100453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of MIMO-OFDMA Systems in Correlated Fading Channels and Non-Stationary Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Arrays","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","next generation networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDMA systems","correlated fading channels","non-stationary interference","multiple input multiple output antenna systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","next generation wireless networks","broadband wireless standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)","beamforming","OSTBC","interference management","effective SINR","WiMAX","LTE","LTE advanced"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MIMO-OFDMA Systems in Correlated Fading Channels and Non-Stationary Interference","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5737895/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007245","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MIMO-OFDMA Systems in Correlated Fading Channels and Non-Stationary Interference","sourcePdf":"1480-tw1105-molteni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10387S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5737895","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5737896,"authors":[{"name":"Azad Ravanshid","affiliation":["Institute for Information Transmission, University Erlangen-Nu\u00fcnberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5769516/5737896/5737896-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Azad Ravanshid received his M.

In this paper, we investigate half-duplex DDF relaying based on rateless codes. The use of rateless codes allows relays to autonomously switch from listening to the source node to transmitting to the destination node. We first revisit different signal combining strategies applied at the destination node, namely energy and information combining known from literature, and propose a new combining method which we refer to as mixed combining. The different combining methods give rise to different achievable rates, i.e., constrained channel capacities, for which we provide analytical expressions. The capacity analysis reveals the conditions under which mixed combining is superior and how it can be optimized. We then consider Raptor codes as a specific implementation of rateless codes and develop a density-evolution approximation to predict the data-rate performance of these codes in DDF relaying. Furthermore, we devise an optimization of the output symbol degree distribution of Raptor codes that is mainly used to benchmark the performance of Raptor codes with a fixed degree distribution. Numerical results for exemplary three-node and four-node relay networks show that the proposed mixed combining provides significant gains in achievable data rate and that Raptor codes with a fixed degree distribution are able to realize these gains and to approach closely the constrained-capacity limits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5737896/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007246","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Decode-and-Forward Relaying using Raptor Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Decode-and-Forward Relaying using Raptor Codes","sourcePdf":"1569-tw1105-ravanshid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082753S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5737896","onlineDate":"22 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5737970,"authors":[{"name":"George B Moody","affiliation":["Harvard/MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"George B","lastName":"Moody","id":"38490535400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7319-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7318-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-8853"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0276-6574"}],"articleNumber":"5737970","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737970","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cardiology","Biomedical monitoring","Image reconstruction","Electrocardiography","Blood pressure","MIMICs","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","haemodynamics","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","parameter estimation","pneumodynamics","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PhysioNet","cardiology","signal reconstruction","ECG","continuous blood pressure waveforms","respiration","intensive care units","robust parameter estimation","unreliable signals","inpatient state change detection","signal corruption recognition"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/5730001/5737883/05737970.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Computing in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Computing in Cardiology","startPage":"305","endPage":"308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5737883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2010: Mind the gap","abstract":"Participants in the 11th annual PhysioNet/CinC Challenge were asked to reconstruct, using any combination of available prior and concurrent information, 30-second segments of ECG, continuous blood pressure waveforms, respiration, and other signals that had been removed from recordings of patients in intensive care units.

Sources for the most successful methods developed for this challenge have been made available by their authors to support research on robust estimation of parameters derived from unreliable signals, detection of changes inpatient state, and recognition of signal corruption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737970/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11883680","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5737970/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2010: Mind the gap","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2010: Mind the gap","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"0305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036728S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5730001","isNumber":"5737883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5730001","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5737883","articleId":"5737970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CCAL","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5737973,"authors":[{"name":"AM Sullivan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, AeroSpace, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"AM","lastName":"Sullivan","id":"37088018342"},{"name":"H Xia","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, AeroSpace, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"H","lastName":"Xia","id":"37676762000"},{"name":"JC McBride","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, AeroSpace, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"JC","lastName":"McBride","id":"37088018890"},{"name":"X Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical, AeroSpace, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"X","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37677665100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7319-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7318-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-8853"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0276-6574"}],"articleNumber":"5737973","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5737973","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Delay","Artificial neural networks","Biomedical monitoring","Electrocardiography","Mathematical model","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","data analysis","electrocardiography","medical diagnostic computing","medical signal processing","neural nets","patient monitoring","principal component analysis","signal denoising","signal reconstruction","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","physiological signal reconstruction","real-time monitoring","patient diagnosis","ICU patient","data analysis","principal component analysis","wavelet-based denoising algorithm","focused time-delayed neural network","distributed time-delayed neural network","nonlinear autoregressive network","data sets","electrocardiogram"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/5730001/5737883/05737973.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Computing in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Computing in Cardiology","startPage":"317","endPage":"320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5737883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of missing physiological signals using artificial neural networks","abstract":"Real-time monitoring of vital physiological signals is of significant clinical relevance. Disruptions in the signals are frequently encountered and make it difficult for precise diagnosis. Thus, the ability to accurately predict/recover the lost signals could greatly impact medical research and application. In response to the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2010: Mind the Gap, we develop an algorithm based on artificial neural networks to predict the missing signals in one channel using the measurements in other channels. An artificial neural network model is created for each record, which consists of 6, 7, or 8 signals acquired from bedside ICU patient monitors. We first train the network using data from the beginning 9.5 minutes of the record. Then, we reconstruct the missing data in the subsequent 30 seconds for a specific channel. A few techniques are utilized to improve the performance of the model. Principal component analysis is used to reduce complexity and computational cost. Noisy signals are smoothed using a wavelet-based de-noising algorithm before training and testing. We explored three different neural networks: focused time-delayed neural network, distributed time-delayed neural network, and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs. The focused time-delayed neural network is more computationally efficient while the other two networks provide slightly more precise predictions. For highly correlated data sets, all three networks are able to produce accurate predictions; however, predictions of chaotic and highly noisy data sets are less satisfactory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5737973/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11883683","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5737973/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of missing physiological signals using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of missing physiological signals using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"0317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040164S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5730001","isNumber":"5737883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5730001","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5737883","articleId":"5737973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CCAL","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738004,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Chee Tat Ho","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Thomas Chee Tat","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757200"},{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403974900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7319-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7318-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-8853"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0276-6574"}],"articleNumber":"5738004","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Bayesian methods","Training","Pattern matching","Euclidean distance","Stress","Cardiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","cardiology","medical signal processing","neural nets","pattern matching","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiac signals","pattern matching","neural networks","cardiac information","Physionet Challenge 2010","signal reconstruction","heart","stress","cross-reference scoring","signal segment","missing gap","Bayesian network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738004","abstract":"An approach to reconstruct the missing signals by pattern matching and neural networks is proposed in this paper for The Physionet Challenge 2010, \u201cMind the Gap\u201d.

In this paper, we propose a simple channel sensing order for secondary users in multi-channel CRNs without a priori knowledge of primary user activities. By sensing the channels according to the descending order of their achievable rates with optimal stopping, we show that the proposed channel exploitation approach is efficient yet effective in elevating throughput and resource utilization. Simulation results show that our proposed channel exploitation approach outperforms its counterparts by up to 18% in a single-secondary user pair scenario. In addition, we investigate the probability of packet transmission collision in a multi-secondary user pair scenario, and show that the probability of collision decreases as the number of channels increases and/or the number of secondary user pairs decreases. It is observed that the total throughput and resource utilization increase with the number of secondary user pairs due to increased transmission opportunities and multi-user diversity. Our results also demonstrate that resource utilization can be further improved via the proposed channel exploitation approach when the number of secondary user pairs approaches the number of channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Channel Sensing Order in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738213.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Simple Channel Sensing Order in Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5738213/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883275","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Channel Sensing Order in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"676jsac0411cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084591S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738214,"authors":[{"name":"Kaigui Bian","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738214/5738214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaigui Bian received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2005 from Peking University, China, and his Master's degree in Computer Engineering in 2007 from Virginia Tech.

The use of a dedicated common control channel simplifies the rendezvous process but may not be feasible in many opportunistic spectrum sharing scenarios due to the dynamically changing availability of all the channels, including the control channel. To address this problem, researchers have proposed the use of channel hopping protocols for enabling rendezvous in CR networks. Most, if not all, of the existing channel hopping schemes only provide ad hoc approaches for generating channel hopping sequences and evaluating their properties. In this paper, we present a systematic approach, based on quorum systems, for designing and analyzing channel hopping protocols for the purpose of control channel establishment. The proposed approach, called Quorum-based Channel Hopping (QCH) system, can be used for implementing rendezvous protocols in CR networks that are robust against link breakage caused by the appearance of incumbent user signals. We describe two synchronous QCH systems under the assumption of global clock synchronization, and two asynchronous channel hopping systems that do not require global clock synchronization. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed channel hopping schemes outperform existing schemes under various network conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738214.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","startPage":"689","endPage":"703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Channel Establishment in Cognitive Radio Networks using Channel Hopping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control Channel Establishment in Cognitive Radio Networks using Channel Hopping","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883276","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738214/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Channel Establishment in Cognitive Radio Networks using Channel Hopping","sourcePdf":"689jsac0411bian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092427S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5738215,"authors":[{"name":"Amr A.

Exploiting source burstiness, secondary cognitive nodes utilizes primary nodes' periods of silence to access the channel and transmit their packets. Cognitive relays could also make use of these silence periods to offer spatial diversity without incurring bandwidth efficiency losses. First, we consider the cognitive cooperation protocol and propose two different relay assignment schemes. Comparison between the proposed schemes is carried out through a maximum stable throughput analysis of the network. Then, secondary nodes access to the remaining idle channel resources is investigated. Queueing theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal that despite the fact that relays occupy part of the idle resources to provide cooperation, secondary nodes surprisingly achieve higher throughput in the presence of relays. The rationale is that relays help primary nodes empty their queues at faster rates, therefore, secondary nodes observe increased access opportunities to the channel.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","startPage":"704","endPage":"715","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738215.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Multiple Access for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738215/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Multiple Access for Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883277","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Multiple Access for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"704jsac0411sadek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057052S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738216,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738216/5738216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi Zhang (S'89-SM'98) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, the M.S. degree from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, all in electrical engineering and computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science (Electrical Engineering-Systems) from The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.","He is currently an Associate Professor and the Founding Director of the Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A'M University, College Station.

It is challenging to maximize the spectrum utilization while limiting the interference imposed to PUs due to SUs. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the spectrum utilization and the interference caused by SUs, we propose the adaptive spectrum sharing schemes for code division multiple access (CDMA) based cognitive medium access control (MAC) in the uplink communications over the cognitive radio networks. Our proposed schemes address the joint problems of channel sensing, data transmission, and power and rate allocations. Under our proposed schemes, the SUs can adaptively select between the intrusive spectrum sharing and the non-intrusive spectrum sharing operations to transmit data to SBS based on the channel utilization, traffic load, and interference constraints. Our proposed schemes enable the SUs to efficiently utilize the available frequency spectrum which is licensed to the PUs while stringently limiting the interference to the PUs. Also conducted are extensive simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed schemes, which show the superiority of our proposed schemes as compared with the other schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738216.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110405","startPage":"716","endPage":"730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Schemes for CDMA-Based Uplink MAC in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738216/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Schemes for CDMA-Based Uplink MAC in Cognitive Radio Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738216/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11883278","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Schemes for CDMA-Based Uplink MAC in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"716jsac0411zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073722S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5738217,"authors":[{"name":"Animashree Anandkumar","affiliation":["Center of Pervasive Communications and Computing, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738217/5738217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Animashree Anandkumar (S' 02, M' 09) received her B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2004 and her Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Applied Math from Cornell University in 2009.

The availability statistics of the channels are initially unknown to the secondary users and are estimated using sensing decisions. There is no explicit information exchange or prior agreement among the secondary users and sensing and access decisions are undertaken by them in a completely distributed manner. We propose policies for distributed learning and access which achieve order-optimal cognitive system throughput (number of successful secondary transmissions) under self play, i.e., when implemented at all the secondary users. Equivalently, our policies minimize the sum regret in distributed learning and access, which is the loss in secondary throughput due to learning and distributed access. For the scenario when the number of secondary users is known to the policy, we prove that the total regret is logarithmic in the number of transmission slots. This policy achieves order-optimal regret based on a logarithmic lower bound for regret under any uniformly-good learning and access policy. We then consider the case when the number of secondary users is fixed but unknown, and is estimated at each user through feedback. We propose a policy whose sum regret grows only slightly faster than logarithmic in the number of transmission slots.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738217.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Algorithms for Learning and Cognitive Medium Access with Logarithmic Regret","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Sensors","Throughput","Indexes","Channel estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithm","cognitive medium access","distributed learning","cognitive network","distributed access","transmission slot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive medium access control","multi-armed bandits","distributed algorithms","logarithmic regret"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Algorithms for Learning and Cognitive Medium Access with Logarithmic Regret","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5738217/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883279","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Algorithms for Learning and Cognitive Medium Access with Logarithmic Regret","sourcePdf":"731jsac0411Anandkum.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09588S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738219,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738219/5738219-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li-Chun Wang (S'92-M'96-SM'06-F'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1986, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.","In 1995, he was affiliated with Northern Telecom in Richardson, Texas. from 1996 to 2000, he was with AT&T Laboratories, where he was a Senior Technical Staff Member in the Wireless Communications Research Department.

Unlike the non-load-balancing methods that multiple secondary users may contend for the same channel, the considered load-balancing schemes can distribute the traffic loads of secondary users to multiple channels. Based on the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing theory, a spectrum decision analytical model is proposed to evaluate the effects of multiple interruptions from the primary user during each link connection, the sensing errors (i.e., missed detection and false alarm) of the secondary users, and the heterogeneous channel capacity. With the objective of minimizing the overall system time of the secondary users, we derive the optimal number of candidate channels and the optimal channel selection probability for the sensing-based and the probability-based spectrum decision schemes, respectively. We find that the probability-based scheme can yield a shorter overall system time compared to the sensing-based scheme when the traffic loads of the secondary users is light, whereas the sensing-based scheme performs better in the condition of heavy traffic loads. If the secondary users can intelligently adopt the best spectrum decision scheme according to sensing time and traffic conditions, the overall system time can be improved by 50% compared to the existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738219.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","startPage":"757","endPage":"769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Balancing Spectrum Decision for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load-Balancing Spectrum Decision for Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883281","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738219/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Balancing Spectrum Decision for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"757jsac0411wang1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097537S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5738220,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Yu Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738220/5738220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao Yu Wang received the M.A.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, in 2006.

In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Medium Access (SMA) scheme that takes interference constraints into account to improve spectrum sharing efficiency. Specifically, the proposed SMA scheme is developed to serve in a CR network without dedicated control channels, such that the probability of successful channel accesses can be maximized. The formulated optimization problem is then solved by using a dynamic Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo scheme. Moreover, the paper introduces a suite of mechanisms for implementation of the proposed SMA scheme, including segmentation of long packets and contention resolution, which is working on top of power controlled Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-to-Send (CTS) exchanges in a multichannel environment. An analytical model is developed on the proposed SMA scheme using an absorbing Markov chain model to evaluate throughput of the secondary user network. Extensive simulation is conducted to study the impact of some important factors on the proposed SMA scheme, such as channel conditions and secondary traffic loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","volume":"29","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11883282","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738220/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Medium Access for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Medium Access for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"770jsac0411wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073043S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738221,"authors":[{"name":"Cunhao Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738221/5738221-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cunhao Gao (S'08) received his B.S. and M.E. degree in Computer Science from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

However, the CR operation must not interfere with the transmissions of the licensed or primary users (PUs), and this is generally achieved by incurring a trade-off in the CR network performance. In order to evaluate this trade-off, a distributed CR routing protocol for ad hoc networks (CRP) is proposed that makes the following contributions: (i) explicit protection for PU receivers that are generally not detected during spectrum sensing, (ii) allowing multiple classes of routes based on service differentiation in CR networks, and (iii) scalable, joint route-spectrum selection. A key novelty of CRP is the mapping of spectrum selection metrics, and local PU interference observations to a packet forwarding delay over the control channel. This allows the route formation undertaken over a control channel to capture the environmental and spectrum information for all the intermediate nodes, thereby reducing the computational overhead at the destination. Results reveal the importance of formulating the routing problem from the viewpoint of safeguarding the PU communication, which is a unique feature in CR networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11883284","htmlLink":"/document/5738222/","displayDocTitle":"CRP: A Routing Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRP: A Routing Protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"794jsac0411chowdhury.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05891S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5738224,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar Alshamrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738224/5738224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ammar Alshamrani received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1997 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2010.","Since 1997, he has been with the Ministry of Defense and Aviation of Saudi Arabia as a Telecommunications Engineer, where he has gained theoretical and practical experience in different kinds of telecommunications and electronic warfare systems.

In this context, RRM decision making can be delegated to mobiles by incorporating cognitive capabilities into mobile handsets, resulting in the reduction of signalling and processing burden. This may however result in inefficiencies (such as those known as the \"tragedy of commons\") that are inherent to equilibria in non-cooperative games. Due to the concern for efficiency, centralized network architectures and protocols keep being considered and being compared to decentralized ones. From the point of view of the network architecture, this implies the co-existence of network-centric and terminal-centric RRM schemes. Instead of taking part within the debate among the supporters of each solution, we propose in this paper hybrid schemes where the wireless users are assisted in their decisions by the network that broadcasts aggregated load information. At some system's states, the network manager may impose his decisions on the network users. In other states the mobiles may take autonomous actions in reaction to information sent by the network. In order to improve the performance of the non-cooperative scenario, we investigate the properties of an alternative solution concept named Stackelberg game, in which the network tries to control the users' behavior by broadcasting appropriate information, expected to maximize its utility, while individual users maximize their own utility. We derive analytically the utilities related to the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by mobile users and develop a Bayesian framework to obtain the equilibria. Numerical results illustrate the advantages of using our hybrid game framework in an association problem in a network composed of HSDPA and 3G LTE system that serve streaming and elastic flows.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110414","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738225.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"842","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Approach for Radio Resource Management in Heterogeneous Cognitive Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Approach for Radio Resource Management in Heterogeneous Cognitive Networks","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11883287","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738225/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Approach for Radio Resource Management in Heterogeneous Cognitive Networks","sourcePdf":"831jsac0411haddad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091668S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738226,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738226/5738226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Gao received the B.S. degree in Information Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2006.

Market-driven spectrum trading is an efficient way to achieve dynamic spectrum accessing/sharing. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum trading with single primary spectrum owner (or primary user, PO) selling his idle spectrum to multiple SUs. We model the trading process as a monopoly market, in which the PO acts as monopolist who sets the qualities and prices for the spectrum he sells, and the SUs act as consumers who choose the spectrum with appropriate quality and price for purchasing. We design a monopolist-dominated quality-price contract, which is offered by the PO and contains a set of quality-price combinations each intended for a consumer type. A contract is feasible if it is incentive compatible (IC) and individually rational (IR) for each SU to purchase the spectrum with the quality-price intended for his type. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for the contract to be feasible. We further derive the optimal contract, which is feasible and maximizes the utility of the PO, for both discrete-consumer-type model and continuous-consumer-type model. Moreover, we analyze the social surplus, i.e., the aggregate utility of both PO and SUs, and we find that, depending on the distribution of consumer types, the social surplus under the optimal contract may be less than or close to the maximum social surplus.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.110415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5738209/05738226.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.110415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Contract-Theoretic Modeling Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Contract-Theoretic Modeling Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738226/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11883288","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738226/","volume":"29","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Trading in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Contract-Theoretic Modeling Approach","sourcePdf":"843jsac0411gao2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110685S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"275","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5738227,"authors":[{"name":"Shabnam Sodagari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738227/5738227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shabnam Sodagari received the B.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, MASc from the University of Ottawa, and PhD from the Pennsylvania State University, all in electrical engineering.

However, the back-room dealing (i.e., the frauds of the insincere auctioneer and the bid-rigging between the greedy bidders and the auctioneer) poses significant security challenges, and fails all existing secure auction designs to allocate spectrum bands when considering the frequency reuse in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose THEMIS, a secure spectrum auction leveraging the Paillier cryptosystem to prevent the frauds of the insincere auctioneer as well as the bid-rigging between the bidders and the auctioneer. THEMIS incorporates cryptographic technique into spectrum auction to address the challenges of back-room dealing. It computes and reveals the results of spectrum auction while the actual bidding values of bidders are kept confidential. THEMIS also provides a novel procedure for implementing secure spectrum auction under interference constraints. It has been shown that THEMIS can effectively purge the back-room dealing with limited communication and computational complexity, and achieve similar performance compared with existing insecure spectrum auction designs in terms of spectrum utilization, revenue of the auctioneer, and bidders' satisfaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","volume":"29","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11883290","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738228/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Purging the Back-Room Dealing: Secure Spectrum Auction Leveraging Paillier Cryptosystem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Purging the Back-Room Dealing: Secure Spectrum Auction Leveraging Paillier Cryptosystem","sourcePdf":"866jsac0411pan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099817S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5738229,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738229/5738229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beibei Wang (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering (with the highest honor) from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2009. from 2009 to 2010, she was a research associate at the University of Maryland.

However, few of them have considered the existence of cognitive attackers who can adapt their attacking strategy to the time-varying spectrum environment and the secondary users' strategy. In this paper, we investigate the security mechanism when secondary users are facing the jamming attack, and propose a stochastic game framework for anti-jamming defense. At each stage of the game, secondary users observe the spectrum availability, the channel quality, and the attackers' strategy from the status of jammed channels. According to this observation, they will decide how many channels they should reserve for transmitting control and data messages and how to switch between the different channels. Using the minimax-Q learning, secondary users can gradually learn the optimal policy, which maximizes the expected sum of discounted payoffs defined as the spectrum-efficient throughput. The proposed stationary policy in the anti-jamming game is shown to achieve much better performance than the policy obtained from myopic learning, which only maximizes each stage's payoff, and a random defense strategy, since it successfully accommodates the environment dynamics and the strategic behavior of the cognitive attackers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","volume":"29","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11883291","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738229/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An anti-jamming stochastic game for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An anti-jamming stochastic game for cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"877jsac0411wang3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128754S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"202","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5738230,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5738209/5738230/5738230-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Tan received the B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China in 2007.

Due to the vulnerabilities of spectrum sensing noted in recent studies, a cognitive radio can be attacked during the sensing interval by an adversary who puts spoofing signals in unused bands. Further, once secondary users access unused bands, the adversary can use traditional jamming to interfere with them during transmission. For an energy-constrained intelligent adversary, a two step procedure is formulated to distribute the energy between spoofing and jamming, such that the average sum throughput of the secondary users is minimized. That is, we optimally spoof in the sensing duration and then optimally jam in the transmission slot. In a cluster-based cognitive radio network, when the number of spectral vacancies required by secondary users increases, the optimal attack for the intelligent adversary will shift from jamming only, to a combination of spoofing and jamming, to spoofing only.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","volume":"29","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11883293","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738231/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spoofing or Jamming: Performance Analysis of a Tactical Cognitive Radio Adversary","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spoofing or Jamming: Performance Analysis of a Tactical Cognitive Radio Adversary","sourcePdf":"903jsac0411peng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056972S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5738209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5738209","articleId":"5738231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5738299,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37535283800"},{"name":"Michael A.

The objective of the tutorial is two-fold: (i) to review OFDM fundamentals from its basic mathematical formation to its salient disadvantages and advantages, and (ii) to reveal the unique characteristics of the fiber optical channel and identify the challenges and opportunities in the application of optical OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2132115","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5753252/05738313.pdf","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2132115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM for Flexible High-Speed Optical Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738313/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM for Flexible High-Speed Optical Networks","volume":"29","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2011","accessionNumber":"12020536","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738313/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM for Flexible High-Speed Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-shieh-2132115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198534S","chronDate":"May15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5753252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5753252","articleId":"5738313","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5738315,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Bruzzone","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5753253/5738315/5738315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lorenzo Bruzzone (Fellow, IEEE) received the Laurea (M.S.) degree in electronic engineering (summa cum laude) and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, in 1993 and 1998, respectively.","Currently, he is a Full Professor of Telecommunications at the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, where he teaches remote sensing, pattern recognition, radar, and electrical communications.

The SSR instrument is a radar sounder system at low frequency (HF/VHF band) designed to penetrate the surface of Ganymede icy moon of Jupiter for performing a subsurface analysis with a relatively high range resolution. This active instrument is aimed at acquiring information on the Ganymede (and partially on the Callisto during flybys) shallow subsurface. The paper addresses the main issues related to SSR, presenting its scientific goals, describing the concept and the design procedure of the instrument, and illustrating the signal processing techniques. Despite the fact that SSR can be defined on the basis of the heritage of the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) and SHAllow RADar (SHARAD) instruments currently operating at Mars, the EJSM mission poses additional scientific and technical challenges for its design: 1) the presence of a relevant Jupiter radio emission (which is very critical because it has a significant power spectral density in proximity of the expected SSR central frequency); 2) the properties of the subsurface targets, which are different from those of the Mars subsurface; 3) the different orbit conditions; and 4) the limited available resources (in terms of mass, power, and downlink data rate). These challenges are analyzed and discussed in relation to the design of the instrument in terms of: 1) choice of the central frequency and the bandwidth; 2) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); 3) signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR); and 4) definition of the synthetic aperture processing. Finally, the procedure defined for SSR performance assessment is described and illustrated with some numerical examples.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2108990","startPage":"837","endPage":"857","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

Multipath channels in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication setting is an interesting example where one generally needs to perform channel estimation for each transmit-receive antenna pair. MIMO multipath channels are usually (approximately) sparse and satisfy the common-support property whenever the distances between the antennas are small compared to the distance the electromagnetic wave can travel in the time corresponding to the inverse bandwidth of the communication system. This assumption is satisfied by small and medium bandwidth communication systems like OFDM and CDMA. This leads us to extend the finite rate of innovation sampling and reconstruction scheme to the sparse common-support scenario (SCS-FRI), in which input signals contain Diracs with common locations but arbitrary weights. The goal is to efficiently reconstruct the input signals from a set of uniform samples, making use of the common-support property to improve robustness. We first find the best theoretical performance for the SCS-FRI setup by de riving the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound. Our results show that for a set of well-separated Diracs, it is the total energy of the Diracs at each common position which determines the bound.

SR can also improve the transmission of information within single neurons. Since information processing in the brain is carried out by neural networks and noise is present throughout the brain, the hypothesis that noise and coupling play an important role in the control of information processing within a population of neurons to control was tested. Using computer simulations, we investigate the effect of noise on the transmission of information in an array of neurons, known as array-enhanced SR (AESR) in an interconnected population of hippocampal neurons. A subthreshold synaptic current (signal) modeled by a filtered homogeneous Poisson process was applied to a distal position in each of the apical dendrites, while background synaptic signals (uncorrelated noise) were presented to the midpoint in the basal dendrite. The transmembrane potentials were recorded in each cell of an array of CA1 neuron models, in order to determine spike firing times and to estimate the total and noise entropies from the spike firing times. The results show that the mutual information is maximized for a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, implying the presence of AESR. The results also show that the maximum mutual information increases with increased numbers of neurons and the strength of connections. Moreover, the relative levels of excitation and inhibition modulate the mutual information transfer. It is concluded that uncorrelated noise can enhance information transmission of subthreshold synaptic input currents in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models. Therefore, endogenous neural noise could play an important role in neural tissue by modulating the transfer of information across the network.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2126571","startPage":"1950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5895009/05738322.pdf","endPage":"1958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2126571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738322/","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Resonance Can Enhance Information Transmission in Neural Networks","volume":"58","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738322/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12063167","pubMedId":"21435971","publicationDate":"July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Resonance Can Enhance Information Transmission in Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tbme-mino-2126571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09175S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5895009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5895009","articleId":"5738322","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5738328,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Alcala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5970281/5738328/5738328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafael Alcal\u00e1 received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, both in computer science from the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, where he is a member of the Soft Computing and Intelligent Information Systems Research Group.

One way to address this problem is by determining the used variables, the linguistic partitioning and the rule set together, in order to only evolve very simple, but still accurate models. However, evolving these components together is a difficult task, which involves a complex search space. In this study, we propose an effective multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that, based on embedded genetic database (DB) learning (involved variables, granularities, and slight fuzzy-partition displacements), allows the fast learning of simple and quite-accurate linguistic models. Some efficient mechanisms have been designed to ensure a very fast, but not premature, convergence in problems with a high number of variables. Further, since additional problems could arise for datasets with a large number of instances, we also propose a general mechanism for the estimation of the model error when using evolutionary algorithms, by only considering a reduced subset of the examples. By doing so, we can also apply a fast postprocessing stage for further refining the learned solutions. We tested our approach on 17 real-world datasets with different numbers of variables and instances. Three well-known methods based on embedded genetic DB learning have been executed as references. We compared the different approaches by applying nonparametric statistical tests for multiple comparisons. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method not only in terms of scalability but in terms of the simplicity and generalizability of the obtained models as well.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2131657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5970281/05738328.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2131657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Scalable Multiobjective Genetic Fuzzy System for Linguistic Fuzzy Modeling in High-Dimensional Regression Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738328/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Scalable Multiobjective Genetic Fuzzy System for Linguistic Fuzzy Modeling in High-Dimensional Regression Problems","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205248","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738328/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast and Scalable Multiobjective Genetic Fuzzy System for Linguistic Fuzzy Modeling in High-Dimensional Regression Problems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-alcala-2131657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16975S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5970281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5970281","articleId":"5738328","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5738332,"authors":[{"name":"Marc-Andre Daigneault","affiliation":["Research Group in Microelectronics and Microsystems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5765517/5738332/5738332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marc-Andre Daigneault received the B.Ing. and M.Sc.A. degrees in electrical engineering from the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Research Group in Microelectronics and Microsystems, Department of Electrical Engineering, since 2010, working in the field of high-level synthesis.","His research interests include reconfigurable computing, high-level synthesis, and very large-scale integration systems."]},"firstName":"Marc-Andre","lastName":"Daigneault","id":"38253611300"},{"name":"Jean Pierre David","affiliation":["Research Group in Microelectronics and Microsystems, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5765517/5738332/5738332-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jean Pierre David (M'05) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universite de Liege, Liege, Belgium, in 1995 and the Ph.D. degree from the Universite Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 2002.","He was an Assistant Professor with the Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, for three years.

In this study, we propose a highly effective and efficient method for source optimization and improve a previous method for mask optimization. An SMO framework is implemented by integrating them. Based on pixel-based source and mask representation, the gradients of the objective function are utilized to guide optimization. In addition to maintain the image fidelity, extra penalties are added into the objective function to increase the depth of focus (DOF) and regularize the source and mask patterns. In our SMO framework, a specially designed mask optimization procedure is performed to enhance the algorithm robustness. Afterward, the source optimization and mask optimization are performed alternatively. Convergence results can be acquired using only two or three iteration cycles. This method is demonstrated using two mask patterns with critical dimensions of 45 nm, including a periodic array of contact holes and a cross gate design. The results show that our method can provide great improvements in both image quality and DOF. The robustness of our method is also verified using different initial conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2131668","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6019142/05738339.pdf","startPage":"2856","endPage":"2864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2131668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient-Based Source and Mask Optimization in Optical Lithography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Gradient-Based Source and Mask Optimization in Optical Lithography","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12228629","pubMedId":"21435976","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738339/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient-Based Source and Mask Optimization in Optical Lithography","sourcePdf":"tip-zhang-2131668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069887S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6019142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6019142","articleId":"5738339","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5738343,"authors":[{"name":"Emanoel Costa","affiliation":["Centro de Estudos em Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6006621/5738343/5738343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emanoel Costa (M'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Instituto Militar de Engenharia, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in December 1972 and August 1974, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in January 1978.","Since February 1978, he has been with Centro de Estudos em Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

Initially, a digital elevation model, building databases, and a vegetation model are processed to generate azimuth-elevation maps of path states (clear, shadowed, and blocked) for a large number of observers. At each simulation step, satellite positions are updated, and azimuths and elevations of paths from observers to satellites are calculated. Signal strengths and range errors are assigned to paths with the aid of random number generators for each path state. This information is processed to determine the statistics of the channel. It will be shown that model predictions are able to display good agreement with the results from an experimental campaign carried out for validation purposes. The simulation model will then be applied to a large number of observers deployed along two routes in densely urbanized areas in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22.8\u00b0 S, 43.3\u00b0 W), with buildings displaying different height distributions to quantitatively show how the most probable number of available satellites, the probability that four or more satellites are simultaneously available (that is, that positions can be fixed), and the position errors change with the average building height and for vehicles in static and kinematic modes. In combination with the comparison between measurement and prediction results, this indicates that the simulation model is an efficient and flexible tool for studying and planning satellite-based location and navigation applications with accuracy and sensitivity, which will be used in future developments of mitigation techniques of multipath effects, leading to improved performance of intelligent transportation systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12206878","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738343/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of the Effects of Different Urban Environments on GPS Performance Using Digital Elevation Models and Building Databases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of the Effects of Different Urban Environments on GPS Performance Using Digital Elevation Models and Building Databases","sourcePdf":"tits-costa-2122258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060741S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6006621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6006621","articleId":"5738343","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5738344,"authors":[{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6082048/5738344/5738344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongbin Zhao (M'06\u2013SM'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in August 1994, August 1996, and April 2000, respectively, all in materials processing engineering.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow of humanoid robotics with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from May 2000 to January 2002.

Specifically, we implement the DHP method to solve both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestions with queuing consideration. A coordinated neural network controller is achieved by the DHP method with traffic models. Then, it is used for verifications with different traffic scenarios. Simulation studies performed on a hypothetical freeway indicate that the achieved neural controller maintains good control performance when compared with the classical ramp metering algorithm ALINEA. We emphasize that these neural controllers can be developed offline by using approximate traffic models. This offline mechanism avoids the risks of instability that incur during continual online training.

This paper proposes a novel method of using an adaptive bootstrapped body biasing. The method allows the attenuator to have maximum power handling capability and bandwidth without adding complexity to the circuit. A \u03c0-type variable attenuator for WCDMA transmitters has been designed and fabricated using IBM 0.18-\u03bc m triple-well CMOS technology. The attenuator has a linear-in-dB controllability from 400 MHz to 3.7 GHz with an attenuation range of 33 dB. Its insertion loss is 0.9-2.9 dB and worst-case return loss is better than -9 dB within this frequency band. The minimum input 1-dB compression point (IP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1dB</sub>\n) is above 7.5 dBm, and the minimum IIP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n is greater than 17 dBm at 1.95 GHz.

The modified Gilbert-cell mixer architecture, which eliminates the three-level transistors stacking in the conventional Gilbert-cell mixer, can operate at a reduced supply voltage while maintaining reasonable performance. In addition, IF transimpedance amplifier buffer and wideband RF design are introduced to increase the operation speed of the mixer for MMW gigabit wireless transmission link applications. Using a 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS process, the I/Q modulator and demodulator formed with the modified Gilbert-cell mixers are demonstrated at the MMW. Under 1.2-V standard supply voltage, the modulator and demodulator exhibit excellent conversion gain (CG) flatness of -3.5 \u00b11.5 dB and -3 \u00b11.5 dB from 41 to 69.5 GHz and 31 to 69 GHz, respectively. For 60-GHz wireless personal area network applications, \u03c0/4 differential quadrature phase-shift keying, 16 quadrature amplitude modulation, and binary phase-shift keying modulation signal tests are successfully performed through the direct-conversion system. The results show that the presented monolithic microwave integrated circuits can operate at low-voltage and low-power while providing good CG and high data rate, even up to multigigabit.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2116035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5765527/05738364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2116035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of 1.2-V Broadband High Data-Rate MMW CMOS I/Q Modulator and Demodulator Using Modified Gilbert-Cell Mixer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mixers","Radio frequency","Demodulation","CMOS integrated circuits","Transistors","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","demodulators","field effect MIMIC","low-power electronics","millimetre wave amplifiers","millimetre wave mixers","MMIC","modulators","operational amplifiers","personal area networks","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband high data-rate MMW CMOS I/Q modulator","modified Gilbert-cell mixer architecture","demodulator","high-speed operation mixer design","millimeter-wave CMOS in-phase-quadrature modulator","three-level transistors","IF transimpedance amplifier","wideband RF design","MMW gigabit wireless transmission link","wireless personal area network","differential quadrature phase-shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","binary phase-shift keying modulation signal tests","direct-conversion system","monolithic microwave integrated circuits","voltage 1.2 V","size 0.13 mum","frequency 41 GHz to 69.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","demodulator","direct conversion","gigabit","millimeter wave (MMW)","mixer","modulator","60 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of 1.2-V Broadband High Data-Rate MMW CMOS I/Q Modulator and Demodulator Using Modified Gilbert-Cell Mixer","volume":"59","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11976145","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738364/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738364/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of 1.2-V Broadband High Data-Rate MMW CMOS I/Q Modulator and Demodulator Using Modified Gilbert-Cell Mixer","sourcePdf":"tmtt-tsai-2116035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08713S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5765527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5765527","articleId":"5738364","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5738365,"authors":[{"name":"Han Yan","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory/Delft Institute of Microsystems and Nanoelectronics (DIMES), Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5765527/5738365/5738365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Han Yan was born in Sichuan, China, in 1981.

Research establishes OFDM as a potential candidate for use in MIMO systems for the reasons like inherent FFT, waveform adaptation, advanced antenna techniques, multiple access, interoperability, etc. Since, channel estimation is an integral part of OFDM system; it stands to demand a technique that can offer accurate channel characterization for effective equalization to follow. In addition, there exists a tradeoff between accuracy of estimation and complexity of the technique. In this paper, a combined channel estimation technique, which combines the virtues of Least Squares and LMMSE estimators with SVD in MIMO-OFDM systems. This combined strategy increases the estimate accuracy without much increase in complexity or computation considering a Rayleigh frequency-selective channel environment. The proposed technique is explicated with necessary mathematics and the theory is well substantiated with simulations. The technique is fitted into the OFDM framework and the simulation results indicate a good estimate of the channel.

Among them, maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme provides the minimum bit error rate (BER). However, the complexity of ML detection increases exponentially with the constellation size of modulation and number of users. The M-algorithm combined with QR decomposition (QRD-M) can be substitute to ML detection due its low complexity and it's near optimal performance. In this paper the complexity of QRD-M scheme is compared with ML by means of number of foundational operations and the elapsed time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738235/5738450/05738463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","doi":"10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Near Optimal Multiuser Detection Scheme for SDMA-OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Multiaccess communication","Complexity theory","Multiuser detection","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multiuser detection","OFDM system","SDMA","space division multiple access","multiple input multiple output","wireless communication network","network architecture","maximum likelihood detection","bit error rate","M-algorithm","QR decomposition","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Near Optimal Multiuser Detection Scheme for SDMA-OFDM System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738463/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887671","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Near Optimal Multiuser Detection Scheme for SDMA-OFDM System","confLoc":"Mesra, India","sourcePdf":"cm-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058789S","chronDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738235","isNumber":"5738450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738235","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5738450","articleId":"5738463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5738465,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, India"],"firstName":"Mahesh Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37851404400"},{"name":"Sarika Shrivastava","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Sarika","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37852018900"},{"name":"A.

We have also compared the performance of the proposed PAPR reduction technique with the performance of the existing techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems: A Simple Approach Based on Clipping and Differential Scaling","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","doi":"10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738474","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738235/5738450/05738474.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems: A Simple Approach Based on Clipping and Differential Scaling","conferenceDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738474/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887681","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems: A Simple Approach Based on Clipping and Differential Scaling","confLoc":"Mesra, India","sourcePdf":"cm-143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05696S","chronDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738235","isNumber":"5738450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738235","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5738450","articleId":"5738474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5738477,"authors":[{"name":"Aminul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Deemed University, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Aminul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37398071800"},{"name":"M.

The spiraling business transaction at vending machines and automated systems working on token have spurred better coin recognition techniques saddled with increased robustness.These techniques facilitate transaction making it easier in all forms of trade. Keeping all the essential factors in mind a system has been created which recognizes coin based on image subtraction technique. The process performs 3 checks(radius, coarse and fine)on the input image. The stated subsequent checks enable the technique to endorse Rotation Invariance, thus obviating the need of placing the coin at a certain angle. Also, the technique does away with the requirement of placing the front face of the coin up. Subtraction between the input object image and database image is performed. Further, plotting the resultant values gives minima which if less than a standard threshold establishes the recognition of the coin. Results of MATLAB based simulations have been reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738496","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738235/5738450/05738496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prompt Indian Coin Recognition with Rotation Invariance Using Image Subtraction Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Image segmentation","Pattern recognition","Databases","Artificial neural networks","Gray-scale","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prompt indian coin recognition","rotation invariance","image subtraction technique","different denomination","vending machines","automated systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prompt Indian Coin Recognition with Rotation Invariance Using Image Subtraction Technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11887702","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738496/","conferenceDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738496/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prompt Indian Coin Recognition with Rotation Invariance Using Image Subtraction Technique","confLoc":"Mesra, India","sourcePdf":"ip-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03335S","chronDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738235","isNumber":"5738450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738235","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5738450","articleId":"5738496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5738503,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An adhoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. Each node is considered to be alike here. It is needed to introduce some intelligence to the adhoc networks in order to improve their throughput efficiency. The concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) has been employed to achieve this. CR enabled devices are 'clever' and can listen to the surrounding wireless environment and can select appropriate frequency band, modulation scheme or specific power level as per the requirement. In this way an ability of self decision making can be incorporated in the wireless adhoc networks. Our work presented in this paper shows an initial direction towards the future research possibilities for the implementation of the CR for self aware and self organized adhoc wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11887749","htmlLink":"/document/5738545/","conferenceDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Throughput Efficiency of Adhoc Wireless Networks Using Cognitive Radio Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Throughput Efficiency of Adhoc Wireless Networks Using Cognitive Radio Approach","confLoc":"Mesra, India","sourcePdf":"wc-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037155S","chronDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738235","isNumber":"5738450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738235","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5738450","articleId":"5738545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5738567,"authors":[{"name":"Bikramaditya Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Bikramaditya","lastName":"Das","id":"38613124300"},{"name":"Suryakant Tiwari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Suryakant","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37856271500"},{"name":"Susmita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Das","id":"37404265900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9189-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9188-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5738567","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"abstract":"Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) approach using UWB signals with short duration of pulses provide unique advantages in short-range high data rate wireless applications which include easy penetration through obstacles, high precision ranging and low processing power. A perfect reconstruction using discrete wavelet packet transmultiplexer in MB-OFDM transceiver counters the degrading effect of ISI, and also conserves bandwidth. In comparison to conventional FFT MB-OFDM, Discrete Wavelet Packet Modulation (DWPM) offers much lower side lobes in the transmitted signal, which reduces inter carrier interference (ICI) and narrowband interference (NBI). In this paper a detail study on conventional MB-OFDM and Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT) MB-OFDM is attempted for high data rate ultra wideband (UWB) WPAN physical layer standard. Different multipath components in the UWB channels are characterized by different delays and attenuation. BER performances of MB-OFDM UWB on IEEE 802.15.3a channel models are investigated through simulation study. We show that, at low data rate (55 Mbps) the DWPT MB-OFDM system performs better in the CM4 channel environment than in the CM3 channel due to its inherent frequency diversity. In high data rate (480 Mbps), the BER performance in CM3 channel model is found to be better than in CM4 channel model. DWPT MB-OFDM outperforms than the conventional FFT MB-OFDM for high data rate applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738235/5738450/05738567.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Devices and Communications (ICDeCom)","doi":"10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDECOM.2011.5738567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Study of Discrete Wavelet Packet Based MB-OFDM System for Short Range Indoor Wireless Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wavelet packets","Channel models","Discrete wavelet transforms","Bandwidth","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","personal area networks","radio transceivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short range indoor wireless environment","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","UWB signals","high data rate wireless applications","high precision ranging","low processing power","discrete wavelet packet transmultiplexer","MB-OFDM transceiver","discrete wavelet packet modulation","intercarrier interference reduction","narrowband interference reduction","discrete wavelet packet transform","ultrawideband WPAN physical layer standard","BER performances","IEEE 802.15.3 channel models","frequency diversity","CM3 channel model","CM4 channel model","conventional FFT MB-OFDM","bit rate 55 Mbit/s","bit rate 480 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Study of Discrete Wavelet Packet Based MB-OFDM System for Short Range Indoor Wireless Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738567/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887769","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Study of Discrete Wavelet Packet Based MB-OFDM System for Short Range Indoor Wireless Environment","confLoc":"Mesra, India","sourcePdf":"wc-143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049827S","chronDate":"24-25 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738235","isNumber":"5738450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738235","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5738450","articleId":"5738567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5738569,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Farukh Hashmi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics. and Communication Engineering, Mandsaur Institute of technology, Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Mohammad Farukh","lastName":"Hashmi","id":"37853483300"},{"name":"Pradeep Dhakad","affiliation":["Department of Electronics. and Communication Engineering, Mandsaur Institute of technology, Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Dhakad","id":"37860386100"},{"name":"Baluram Nagaria","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mandsaur Institute of Technology, Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Baluram","lastName":"Nagaria","id":"37860389000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9190-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9189-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9188-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5738569","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":563},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Data models","Multipath channels","Fading","Receivers","Attenuation","Graphical user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA RAKE receiver simulator","wireless communication","code division multiple access","single user link"]}],"abstract":"This paper develops a software wireless communication simulator which simulates a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

We study the design of the spatial source covariance matrices (or source matrices) at the two users and the spatial transformation matrix (or relay matrix) at the relay to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate of the system. The source matrices and the relay matrix are optimized alternately until convergence. If the relay matrix is given, we show that the optimal design of the source matrices (for uniformly weighted sum rate) follows a generalized water filling (GWF) algorithm. If the source matrices are given, we show two search algorithms to optimize the relay matrix. The first algorithm is a hybrid gradient method which adaptively switches between the (steepest) gradient descent and the Newton's search. The second is an iterative weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method which alternately refines the MMSE equalizers at the users and the relay matrix. We compare the convergence behaviors of the two algorithms and demonstrate their advantage over prior algorithms. We also show an optimal structure of the relay matrix, which is useful to reduce the search complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.101173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05738649.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.101173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design of Spatial Source-and-Relay Matrices for a Non-Regenerative Two-Way MIMO Relay System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design of Spatial Source-and-Relay Matrices for a Non-Regenerative Two-Way MIMO Relay System","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738649/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007249","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738649/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design of Spatial Source-and-Relay Matrices for a Non-Regenerative Two-Way MIMO Relay System","sourcePdf":"1645-tw1105-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087184S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5738649","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738650,"authors":[{"name":"Guobing Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5769516/5738650/5738650-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guobing Li (S'07) received his B.

In this paper, a novel cooperation protocol is developed based on complex-field wireless network coding. Sources transmit efficiently information symbols linearly combined with symbols from other sources. Different from existing wireless network coding protocols, transmissions are not restricted to binary symbols, and do not have to be received simultaneously. In a network with N sources, the developed protocol can achieve throughput up to approximately 1/N symbols per source per channel use, as well as diversity of order N. To deal with decoding errors at sources, selective- and adaptive-forwarding protocols are also developed at no loss of diversity gain. Analytical results corroborated by simulated tests show considerable performance gains with respect to distributed space-time coding, and bit-level network coding protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05738650.pdf","startPage":"1606","endPage":"1617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.101077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.101077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Throughput Multi-Source Cooperation via Complex-Field Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Throughput","Decoding","Network coding","Encoding","Measurement","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","diversity reception","network coding","protocols","radio networks","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput multisource cooperation","complex-field network coding","physical-layer network coding","cooperative relaying strategy","diversity gain","cooperation protocol","wireless network coding protocol","decoding error","selective-and adaptive-forwarding protocol","distributed space-time coding","bit-level network coding protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","network coding","multi-source cooperation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-Throughput Multi-Source Cooperation via Complex-Field Network Coding","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5738650/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007250","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Throughput Multi-Source Cooperation via Complex-Field Network Coding","sourcePdf":"1606-tw1105-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106308S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5738650","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738651,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Axell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Axell","id":"37586919900"},{"name":"Erik G.

The uncertainty in CSI is modeled using Stochastic Error (SE) and Norm Bounded Error (NBE) models. The Sum-Mean Square Error (SMSE) performance is used to formulate the design problem. To optimize the network, the transmit power budget for secondary user transmitters and the maximum allowed interference at primary user receivers are constrained. In the design methodology, the network parameters are optimized to best serve the users when the worst possible channel realizations occur. It is shown that for the SE model of uncertainty, this problem can be cast as a Second Order Cone Problem (SOCP), while for the NBE model, the problem becomes a Semi-Definite Program (SDP). These two problems are solved efficiently using the numerical solver packages YALMIP and SDPT3. Finally simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05738652.pdf","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.100337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.100337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Linear Transceiver Design in MIMO Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Ad hoc networks","Uncertainty","IP networks","Robustness","Stochastic processes","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust linear transceiver design","MIMO ad hoc cognitive radio networks","imperfect channel state information","multiple-input multiple-output networks","stochastic error model","norm bounded error model","sum-mean square error performance","secondary user transmitters","primary user receivers","power budget","second order cone problem","semidefinite program","numerical solver packages","YALMIP","SDPT3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust beamforming","cognitive radio network","multi-user MIMO communications","imperfect CSI","worst case design","linear matrix inequality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Linear Transceiver Design in MIMO Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5738652/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007252","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Linear Transceiver Design in MIMO Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"1448-tw1105-gharavol.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078311S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5738652","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738653,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihang Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhihang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37304115700"},{"name":"MinChul Ju","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"MinChul","lastName":"Ju","id":"37339310500"},{"name":"Il-Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Il-Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278943200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5738653","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":792},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Diversity reception","Multiplexing","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","probability","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","time division broadcast protocol","bidirectional protocol","amplify-and- forward-based TDBC protocol","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","bidirectional network","optimum combining method","outage probability","time division broadcast (TDBC)"]}],"abstract":"Time division broadcasting (TDBC) is a well-known bidirectional protocol. In this protocol, two sources exchange information with the help of a relay terminal. For amplify-and-forward (AF)-based TDBC, we first derive a tight lower bound of the outage probability in closed-form, and it is very close to the exact outage probability in the whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range irrespective of the values of channel variances. Using the tight lower bound, diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the TDBC protocol is obtained for finite-SNR. Furthermore, we investigate how to optimize the TDBC protocol; specifically, an optimum method to combine the received signals at the relay terminal is developed. This method minimizes the outage probability and maximizes the total mutual information of the TDBC protocol at the same time.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.100769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05738653.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.100769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability and Optimum Combining for Time Division Broadcast Protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability and Optimum Combining for Time Division Broadcast Protocol","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738653/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007253","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5738653/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability and Optimum Combining for Time Division Broadcast Protocol","sourcePdf":"1362-tw1105-yi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063325S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5738653","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5738655,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Feng","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5769516/5738655/5738655-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiyong Feng received her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), China.

We first analyze the ICI in frequency domain with a reduced set of parameters, and following this analysis, we derive an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood (ML) data detection. An ML-EM receiver for OFDM systems and a TURBO-EM receiver for BICM/OFDM systems are then developed to reduce computational complexity of the EM algorithm and to exploit temporal diversity, the main idea of which is to integrate the proposed EM algorithm with a groupwise ICI cancellation method. Compared with the ML-EM receiver, the TURBO-EM receiver further employs a soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) decoder to exchange information with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) EM detector through the turbo principle. Computer simulation demonstrates that the two proposed receivers clearly outperform the conventional one-tap equalizer, and the performance of the TURBO-EM receiver is close to the matched-filter bound even at a normalized maximum Doppler frequency (MDF) up to 0.2.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5769516/05738656.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.090611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.030911.090611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5769516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-Based Iterative Receivers for OFDM and BICM/OFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Equalizers","Channel estimation","Detectors","Frequency domain analysis","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","matched filters","maximum likelihood detection","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM based iterative receiver","OFDM","BICM","doubly selective channel","expectation-maximization algorithm","inter-carrier interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit interleaved coded modulation","maximum likelihood data detection","TURBO-EM receiver","soft output Viterbi algorithm","matched filter","maximum Doppler frequency","time variant multipath channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit-interleaved coded modulation","inter-carrier interference","expectation-maximization algorithms","turbo receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"EM-Based Iterative Receivers for OFDM and BICM/OFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5738656/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12007256","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-Based Iterative Receivers for OFDM and BICM/OFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"1405-tw1105-ku.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069347S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5769516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5769516","articleId":"5738656","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5738660,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Rudiger","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Rudiger","id":"37397880000"},{"name":"Jeffrey P.

Given the financial and logistical constraints on the size of validation area that can be covered by airborne simulators and the experiments underway that cover only a part of a satellite footprint, timely and scientifically sound advice on fractional footprint coverage requirements by campaigns for these low-resolution sensors is of paramount importance. Using high-resolution airborne data from an extensive airborne campaign in Southeast Australia, the fractional coverage requirement for L-band passive microwave satellite missions is assessed using a subsampling technique of flight lines through a passive microwave footprint. It is shown that minimum 50% coverage of the total footprint size will typically be required, given a spatial variability value of 20 K at 1-km resolution, to ensure that the footprint mean is estimated with an expected sampling error of less than 4 K, which is the design sensitivity of SMOS.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2116766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5910657/05738660.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5910657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2116766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Airborne Spatial Coverage Requirement for Microwave Satellite Validation","volume":"8","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738660/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12073281","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738660/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Airborne Spatial Coverage Requirement for Microwave Satellite Validation","sourcePdf":"lgrs-rudiger-2116766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075687S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5910657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5910657","articleId":"5738660","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5738662,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Hyok Chang","affiliation":["Optical Internet Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sun Hyok","lastName":"Chang","id":"37600628300"},{"name":"Hwan Seok Chung","affiliation":["Optical Internet Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hwan Seok","lastName":"Chung","id":"38254290200"},{"name":"Kwangjoon Kim","affiliation":["Optical Internet Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwangjoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280256400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5738662","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical noise","Optical receivers","Optical polarization","Signal to noise ratio","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing","optical communication equipment","optical modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization multiplexed 16-QAM optical modulation","16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","optical signal","single in phase quadrature modulator","Mach-Zehnder modulator","polarization division multiplexed 16-QAM signal","bit rate 112 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","optical modulation","polarization"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we analyze a 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) optical signal generated by applying four-level electrical signals to a single in-phase/quadrature (IQ)-modulator.

This paper presents a scheme of space-time coding MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) SAR for high-resolution imaging. This system employs MIMO configuration in the elevation direction and the Alamouti space-time coding scheme in the azimuth direction, along with the use of OFDM waveform diversity and displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) techniques. As an orthogonal transmission waveform is required for this novel space-time coding MIMO-OFDM SAR system, one kind of OFDM linearly frequency modulated waveforms is investigated. The matched filtering and multibeam forming in the elevation direction are detailed. Additionally, the corresponding mathematical relations and signal models for high-resolution imaging are formed. In this way, efficient spatial diversity gain and improved range resolution are obtained by the MIMO configuration, and the requirement of pulse repeated frequency for wide-swath remote sensing is reduced by the DPCA technique. The feasibility is validated by numerical simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5959279/05738681.pdf","startPage":"3094","endPage":"3104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2116030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2116030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space\u2013Time Coding MIMO-OFDM SAR for High-Resolution Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Encoding","MIMO","Azimuth","Transmitting antennas","Frequency modulation","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","encoding","filtering theory","imaging","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","remote sensing","space-time codes","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time coding","MIMO-OFDM SAR","high-resolution imaging","multiple-input and multiple-output radar","MIMO radar","MIMO synthetic aperture radar","remote sensing","MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Alamouti space-time coding","azimuth direction","OFDM waveform diversity","displaced phase center antenna","orthogonal transmission waveform","linearly frequency modulated waveforms","matched filtering","multibeam forming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High resolution and wide swath","multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","MIMO radar","MIMO SAR","space\u2013time coding","waveform diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Space\u2013Time Coding MIMO-OFDM SAR for High-Resolution Imaging","volume":"49","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5738681/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12121078","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space\u2013Time Coding MIMO-OFDM SAR for High-Resolution Imaging","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2116030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222703S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5959279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5959279","articleId":"5738681","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5738689,"authors":[{"name":"Woosun An","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/6034617/5738689/5738689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woosun An received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Chung Ang, Seoul, Korea, in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2005.

Each attribute of the mission task is modeled using a hidden Markov model (HMM) with controllable emission matrices, corresponding to each ISR asset package (subset of sensors). For each HMM-asset package pair, we evaluate a matrix of information gains (uncertainty reduction measures). The elements of this matrix depend on the asset coordination structure and the concomitant delays accrued. We consider three coordination structures (distributed ISR coordination, ISR officer serving as a coordinator, and ISR officer serving as a commander) here. We evaluate these structures on a hypothetical mission scenario that requires the monitoring of ISR activities in multiple geographic regions. The three structures are evaluated by comparing the task state estimation error cost, as well as travel, waiting, and assignment delays. The results of the analysis were used as a guide in the design of a mission scenario and asset composition for a team-in-the-loop experimentation. Our solution has the potential to be a mixed initiative decision support tool to an ISR coordinator/commander, where the human provides possible ISR asset package-task pairings and the tool evaluates the efficacy of the assignment in terms of task accuracy and delays. We also apply our approach to a hypothetical disaster management scenario involving chemical contamination and discuss the computational complexity of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2114342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/6034617/05738689.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2114342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6034617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Model and Auction-Based Formulations of Sensor Coordination Mechanisms in Dynamic Task Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5738689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738689/","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Model and Auction-Based Formulations of Sensor Coordination Mechanisms in Dynamic Task Environments","volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300459","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738689/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Model and Auction-Based Formulations of Sensor Coordination Mechanisms in Dynamic Task Environments","sourcePdf":"tsmca-pattipati-2114342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088973S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"6034617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6034617","articleId":"5738689","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5738690,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Chanel","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Genova, Carouge, Switzerland","Computer Science Department, University of Geneva, Carouge, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/6034617/5738690/5738690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guillaume Chanel received the Dipl.Ing. degree in computing from the Institut M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en d'Etude et de Recherche en Informatique et Robotique, Peripgnan, France, in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree in robotics from the University of Montpellier, France, in 2002.

OFDM is a promising solution for achieving high data rates in mobile environment, due to its resistance to ISI, which is a common problem found in high speed data communication. A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication System combined with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique can achieve reliable high data rate transmission over broadband wireless channels. In this paper we will investigate the estimation of channel at high frequencies with conventional Least Square (LS) and Minimum Mean Square (MMSE) estimation algorithms which is carried out through Matlab simulation. The bit-error rate (BER) of multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) in flat Rayleigh fading channel is also analyzed.

Images have long been a part of forensic studies and law enforcement; for example images of criminals, images of crime scenes, biometric images, etc. With the advancement in digital imaging the usage of digital images in this particular field has become more pronounced. The huge development in digital image processing, as much as it has helped in the evolution of many new techniques in forensic studies, has also made image tampering easy. With the commercial availability of many state-of-the-art image editing tools, the authenticity of digital images has become a question. So the requirement of image tampering detection tools has been made inevitable. This paper presents a brief review of some of the latest passive tampering detection methods. A passive method is capable of detecting image forgery without any prior information about the image or its source and it detects tampering by identifying changes in the image properties like inconsistencies in lighting and changes in the mathematical properties of a raw digital image.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communication and Computational Intelligence (INCOCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Communication and Computational Intelligence (INCOCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733272/5738714/05738769.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Survey on passive methods of image tampering detection","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738769/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11887462","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738769/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey on passive methods of image tampering detection","confLoc":"Erode, India","sourcePdf":"431436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052341S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5733272","isNumber":"5738714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733272","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5738714","articleId":"5738769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Kongu Engineering College","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5738795,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajit Dhar","affiliation":["Department of Business Administration, University of Kalyani, India"],"bio":{"p":["First Author, Dr. Satyajit Dhar, a dedicated academician, is engaged in continuous Post graduate teaching and active research over long times.

These modified data are given as input to the ANN in the third stage. Generalized ANN with Back propagation algorithm is used to inspect the transistor. The ANN is trained and the weight values are updated in such a way that the error in identification is the least possible. The output of ANN is the inspected report.

To reduce the power consumption of the state metrics cache (SMC), low-power memory-reduced trace back maximum a posteriori algorithm (MAP) decoding is proposed. Instead of storing all state metrics, the trace back MAP decoding reduces the size of the SMC by accessing difference metrics. The proposed trace back computation requires no complicated reversion checker, path selection, and reversion flag cache. MAP decoders are necessary components of powerful iterative decoding systems such as Turbo codes. For double-binary (DB) MAP decoding, radix-2*2 trace back structures are introduced to provide a trade off power consumption. Trace back MAP decoding: In this, the trace back MAP decoding is proposed to trace the state metrics back by accessing the difference metrics. Trace back convolutional decoding: In the conventional path, the state metrics computed by the natural recursion processor (NRP) in the natural order are stored in the SMC. These two trace back structure, MAP decoding structure achieve power reduction of the state metrics cache.

Image registration methods can be categorized into two major groups: the feature-based approach and the area-based approach. In area-based approach LPT was introduced for its scale and rotation invariant properties. LPT suffers from the non-uniform sampling and bias matching problem. Thus APT was introduced that requires less computational cost in the transformation process than that of the conventional LPT, while maintaining the robustness to the changes in scale and rotation using a projection transform. In order to reduce the computational load, feature points are selected, using which APT is applied to register the image. Gabor transform is one of the methods that can be used to find the feature points. The feature points generated so, are present at the edges of the image also. The presence of feature points along the edges cannot be used to register an image, as they are prone to variations when scaled or rotated.

Various MAC scheduling policies have been implemented, in order to provide distributed traffic control and robustness against interference. Further, in order to increase the efficiency of resource-utilization, the scheduling policies have been modified, and those have also been implemented.

However, in this paper, we show that it does not always lead to a higher reliability with more replicas. Besides, the more replicas implies more resource consumption and higher economic cost. To address this problem, with the target to satisfy the user's reliability requirement with minimum resources, this paper proposes a new fault tolerant scheduling algorithm: MaxRe. In the algorithm, we incorporate the reliability analysis into the active replication schema, and exploit a dynamic number of replicas for different tasks. Both the theoretical analysis and experiments prove that the MaxRe algorithm's schedule can certainly satisfy user's reliability requirements. And the MaxRe scheduling algorithm can achieve the corresponding reliability with at most 70% fewer resources than the FTSA algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","startPage":"434","endPage":"441","doi":"10.1109/HPCC.2010.72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2010.72","pdfPath":"/iel5/5581177/5581318/05738914.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5581318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant scheduling with dynamic number of replicas in heterogeneous systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738914/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant scheduling with dynamic number of replicas in heterogeneous systems","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883906","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5738914/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant scheduling with dynamic number of replicas in heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"17400_ADD-Fault-Tolerant Scheduling.3-21-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060483S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5581177","isNumber":"5581318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5581177","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5581318","articleId":"5738914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5738915,"authors":[{"name":"Danhua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404881600"},{"name":"Xiaoming Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Tao","id":"37272696200"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"},{"name":"Meng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37859315700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5738915","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1000},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We investigate the resource allocation problem in heterogeneous cooperative OFDMA systems. In contrast to existing literature, which mainly focuses on best effort (BE) services or non-real-time (nRT) services, we consider real-time (RT) services with strict delay and rate requirements. Exploiting the wireless channel and queue information, a utility-based optimization problem is formulated for dynamic subcarrier allocation and relay selection supporting mixed BE and RT services. An efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem and simulation results show that our algorithm can effectively improves average delay performance and RT services

This issue termed as spatial false alarm (SFA) problem is one of determinants on SU's medium access probability. However, it is neglected in current research related to spectrum sensing. By thoroughly study, the principle of SFA is presented to reveal the cause of this problem. Moreover, we quantify the impact of SFA by a closed-form expression to correctly evaluate the medium access probability for SU. The simulation results evidence both the importance of SFA and the validity of the derived medium access probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5738916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988604","htmlLink":"/document/5738916/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial False Alarms in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial False Alarms in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"518-cl1105-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05316S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5765867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5765867","articleId":"5738916","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5739010,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen Salihundam","affiliation":["Microprocessor Research, Intel Corporation, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5738962/5739010/5739010-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Praveen Salihundam received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2003 and the M.Tech. degree in VLSI system design from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India, in 2006.","He joined Intel India, Bangalore, in 2006, and currently he is a member of Advanced Microprocessor Research, Intel Labs.

It is important to estimate the TSV noise transfer function and manage the noise-tolerance budget in the design of a reliable 3D-IC system. In this paper, a TSV noise coupling model is proposed based on a three-dimensional transmission line matrix method (3D-TLM). Using the proposed TSV noise coupling model, the noise transfer functions from TSV to TSV and TSV to the active circuit can be precisely estimated in complicated 3D structures, including TSVs, active circuits, and shielding structures such as guard rings. To validate the proposed model, a test vehicle was fabricated using the Hynix via-last TSV process. The proposed model was successfully verified by frequency- and time-domain measurements. Additionally, a noise isolation technique in 3D-IC using a guard ring structure is proposed. The proposed noise isolation technique was also experimentally demonstrated; it provided -17 dB and -10dB of noise isolation between the TSV and an active circuit at 100 MHz and 1 GHz, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2010.2101892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/5739011/05739017.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2010.2101892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Through-Silicon Via (TSV) Noise Coupling and Suppression Using a Guard Ring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Through-Silicon Via (TSV) Noise Coupling and Suppression Using a Guard Ring","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11883886","htmlLink":"/document/5739017/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Through-Silicon Via (TSV) Noise Coupling and Suppression Using a Guard Ring","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-cho-2101892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127919S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"5739011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"5739011","articleId":"5739017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739019,"authors":[{"name":"Joohee Kim","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5739011/5739019/5739019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joohee Kim (S'09) received B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her research interests include TSV modeling and power consumption analysis in TSV-based 3-D IC.","Ms. Kim was the recipient of the Best Student Paper Award in 18th IEEE Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems (EPEPS) 2009 conference."]},"firstName":"Joohee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600788700"},{"name":"Jun So Pak","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5739011/5739019/5739019-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jun So Pak (M'02) received the B.S. degree in electrical communication engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","In 2005, he was a Research Fellow supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in the High Density Interconnection Group, AIST, Tsukuba, Japan, where he was involved in the development of interconnection techniques and interposer for 3-D multichip packaging.

The proposed model includes not only the TSV, but also the bump and the redistribution layer (RDL), which are additional components when using TSVs for 3-D integrated circuit (IC) design. The proposed model is developed with analytic \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RLGC</i>\n equations derived from the physical configuration. Each analytic equation is proposed as a function of design parameters of the TSV, bump, and RDL, and is therefore, scalable. The scalability of the proposed model is verified by simulation from the 3-D field solver with parameter variations, such as TSV diameter, pitch between TSVs, and TSV height. The proposed model is experimentally validated through measurements up to 20 GHz with fabricated test vehicles of a TSV channel, which includes TSVs, bumps, and RDLs. Based on the proposed scalable model, we analyze the electrical behaviors of a TSV channel with design parameter variations in the frequency domain. According to the frequency-domain analysis, the capacitive effect of a TSV is dominant under 2 GHz. On the other hand, as frequency increases over 2 GHz, the inductive effect from the RDLs becomes significant. The frequency dependent loss of a TSV channel, which is capacitive and resistive, is also analyzed in the time domain by eye-diagram measurements. Due to the frequency dependent loss, the voltage and timing margins decrease as the data rate increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","volume":"1","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11883888","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739019/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Scalable Electrical Model and Analysis of a Through Silicon Via (TSV)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Scalable Electrical Model and Analysis of a Through Silicon Via (TSV)","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-kim-2101890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137113S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"5739011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"5739011","articleId":"5739019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5739020,"authors":[{"name":"Jun So Pak","affiliation":["Terahertz Interconnection and Package Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5739011/5739020/5739020-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun So Pak (M'02) received the B.S. degree in electrical communication engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","In 2005, he was a Research Fellow supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in the High Density Interconnection Group, AIST, Tsukuba, Japan, where he was involved in the development of interconnection techniques and interposer for 3-D multichip packaging.

The proposed modeling and analysis methods for the P/G TSV and chip-PDN are fundamental for estimating the PDN impedances of 3D TSV ICs because they are composed of several chip-PDNs and several thousands of P/G TSV connections. Using the proposed P/G TSV array model, we obtained very efficient analyses and estimations of 3D TSV IC PDNs, including the effects of TSV inductance and multiple-TSV inductance, depending on P/G TSV arrangement and the number of stacked chip-PDNs of a 3D TSV IC PDN. Inductances related to TSVs, combined with chip-PDN inductance and capacitance, created high upper peaks of PDN impedance, near 1 GHz. Additionally, the P/G TSV array produced various TSV array inductance effects on stacked chip-PDN impedance, according to their arrangement, and induced high PDN impedance, over 10 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2010.2101771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/5739011/05739020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2010.2101771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739011","startPage":"208","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PDN Impedance Modeling and Analysis of 3D TSV IC by Using Proposed P/G TSV Array Model Based on Separated P/G TSV and Chip-PDN Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PDN Impedance Modeling and Analysis of 3D TSV IC by Using Proposed P/G TSV Array Model Based on Separated P/G TSV and Chip-PDN Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11883889","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739020/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PDN Impedance Modeling and Analysis of 3D TSV IC by Using Proposed P/G TSV Array Model Based on Separated P/G TSV and Chip-PDN Models","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-pak-2101771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073388S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"5739011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5739011","articleId":"5739020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739027,"authors":[{"name":"Chifeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405888900"},{"name":"Wen-Hsiang Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wen-Hsiang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37399456100"},{"name":"Nader Bagherzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Bagherzadeh","id":"37267183200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9682-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1066-6192"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5750"}],"articleNumber":"5739027","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1830},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","System-on-a-chip","Routing","Throughput","System recovery","Algorithm design and analysis","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","radio networks","radiocommunication","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless network-on-chip design","multicore platform","on-chip interconnection","system performance","reliability","on-chip communication infrastructure","IP cores","wireless communications","on-chip antennas","on-chip wireless communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip (NoC)","On-chip wireless interconnect","Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC)"]}],"abstract":"Aggressive scaling of transistors allows integration of hundreds of processors on a chip.

The motivation of our work stems from (a) the mandate for multicore designs to make efficient use of the on-chip resources, (b) the frequent presence of vector operations in high-performance scientific and embedded applications, (c) the increased probability that different cores may deal with different vector lengths at various times, and (d) different vector kernels in the same or different application suites may have diverse computation needs. Our objective is to provide a versatile design framework that can facilitate vector coprocessor sharing among multiple cores in a manner that maximizes resource utilization while also yielding very high performance at reduced cost. We propose three basic shared vector coprocessor architectures for multicores based on coarse-grain, fine-grain and vector lane sharing. We benchmark these distinct vector architectures for a dual-core system using the floating-point performance and resource utilization metrics. Our analysis shows that vector lane sharing, where the number of vector lanes assigned to a core can be controlled dynamically, provides the greatest flexibility and generally yields very good results. Since, however, each of the three design choices has its own performance advantages under certain vector-load conditions, we ultimately suggest a hybrid vector coprocessor design that can support all three architectural choices as per the core and application collective needs.","doi":"10.1109/PDP.2011.64","publicationTitle":"2011 19th International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738449/5738968/05739048.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDP.2011.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip Vector Coprocessor Sharing for Multicores","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Feb. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739048/","displayDocTitle":"On-chip Vector Coprocessor Sharing for Multicores","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887852","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739048/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip Vector Coprocessor Sharing for Multicores","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"4328a431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048724S","chronDate":"9-11 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738449","isNumber":"5738968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738449","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5738968","articleId":"5739048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739050,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Huang","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Huang","id":"37859748600"},{"name":"Christian Buckl","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Buckl","id":"37296897900"},{"name":"Andreas Raabe","affiliation":["Fortiss GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Raabe","id":"37699510900"},{"name":"Alois Knoll","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37276234100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9682-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1066-6192"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5750"}],"articleNumber":"5739050","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":525},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739050","abstract":"Energy-efficiency is becoming one of the most critical issues in embedded system design. In Network-on-Chip (NoC) based heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems, the energy consumption is influenced dramatically by task allocation schemes. Although various approaches are proposed to allocate tasks in an energy-efficient way, existing work does not well explore the tradeoff between the two major power consumers, namely the processors and network links, resulting in sub optimal mappings from a system point of view. In this paper, we first extend the existing Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to take both processing and communication energy into account. Thereafter, we propose a Simulated Annealing with Timing Adjustment (SA-TA) heuristic to accelerate the optimization process. While the SA-TA algorithm achieves performance very close to the global optimum, significant improvement in computation speed is observed.","doi":"10.1109/PDP.2011.10","startPage":"447","endPage":"454","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 19th International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738449/5738968/05739050.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 19th International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDP.2011.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Task Allocation for Network-on-Chip Based Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Timing","Optimization","Energy consumption","Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","integer programming","linear programming","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","power aware computing","processor scheduling","resource allocation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy aware task allocation","network-on-chip","heterogeneous multiprocessor system","embedded system design","integer linear programming","simulated annealing with timing adjustment","SA-TA","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Task Allocation for Network-on-Chip Based Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739050/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"9-11 Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887854","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Task Allocation for Network-on-Chip Based Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"4328a447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12776S","chronDate":"9-11 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5738449","isNumber":"5738968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738449","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5738968","articleId":"5739050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5739051,"authors":[{"name":"Amirali Habibi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amirali","lastName":"Habibi","id":"37290378500"},{"name":"Mouhammad Arjomand","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mouhammad","lastName":"Arjomand","id":"37400275000"},{"name":"Hamid Sarbazi-Azad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Sarbazi-Azad","id":"38270047600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9682-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1066-6192"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5750"}],"articleNumber":"5739051","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Bandwidth","Unicast","Routing","System-on-a-chip","Tiles","Multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast-aware mapping algorithm","networks-on-chip","on-chip communication architectures","multicore SoC","IP cores","NoC tiles","end-to-end delay","energy consumption","multicast communication","unicast traffic flows"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip","Multicast","Mapping"]}],"abstract":"Networks-on-Chip (NoCs for short) are known as the most scalable and reliable on-chip communication architectures for multi-core SoCs with tens to hundreds IP cores.

While almost all previous works on mapping consider higher priority for the application's flows with higher required bandwidth, a mapping strategy, presented in this paper, is introduced that considers multicast communication flows in addition to the normal unicast flows. To this end, multicast and unicast traffic flows are first characterized in terms of some new metrics which are then used for arranging communication flows based on their volume and priority. A heuristic approach is used to assign IP cores to NoC tiles.

To design a column driver for thin-film transistor liquid-crystal displays (TFT-LCDs), both low power consumption and chip area are key problems that must be solved. Therefore, the proposed cross-self-bias buffer amplifier effectively reduces the circuit area and power consumption overheads of conventional class-AB biasing techniques. The 640-channel 6-bit column driver is implemented using 0.18-\u03bcm high-voltage CMOS technology. The proposed column driver is then used in an SXGA LCD panel to perform the experimental characterization. The measured performance of column driver exhibits maximum settling times of 1.4 \u03bcs and 1.2 \u03bcs for rising and falling edges, respectively, under one-dot inversion. The quiescent current consumption of the proposed rail-to-rail buffer is about 4 \u03bcA .","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Driver circuits","MOS devices","Thin film transistors","Power demand","Pixel","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","driver circuits","liquid crystal displays","low-power electronics","thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-self-bias rail-to-rail column buffer","TFT-LCD","LCD column driver","cross-self-bias push-pull buffer","thin film transistor","liquid crystal display","low power consumption","cross-self-bias buffer amplifier","class-AB amplifier","high-voltage CMOS technology","SXGA LCD panel","word length 6 bit","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Column driver","cross-self-bias","rail-to-rail buffer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JDT.2010.2100367","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/9425/5739079/05739081.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2010.2100367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Self-Bias Rail-to-Rail Column Buffer for 640-Channel 6-Bit TFT-LCD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Self-Bias Rail-to-Rail Column Buffer for 640-Channel 6-Bit TFT-LCD","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739081/","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739081/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11879266","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Self-Bias Rail-to-Rail Column Buffer for 640-Channel 6-Bit TFT-LCD","sourcePdf":"jdt-wang-2100367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104052S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"5739079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5739079","articleId":"5739081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5739083,"authors":[{"name":"Koh Johguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/5739011/5739083/5739083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Koh Johguchi (S'06\u2013M'07) received the B.E, M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan, in 2002, 2004, and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

With respect to a previous approach, we use the kernel trick to apply a Tucker decomposition on a higher dimensional feature space instead of the input space. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize for the lower rank Tucker tensor in the feature space. We evaluate the effect of the kernel algorithm with respect to non-kernel GTD, and also compare the results to those from principal component analysis bivarate wavelet shirinking on real images.

The choice of a thin tunneling oxide (~0.9 nm) in a write-in port, spatially and electrically separated from a read-out port incorporating a thicker (~1.8 nm) oxide on an extended thin-film multilayer stack, significantly improves the overall cell stability and parametric process yield of a memory array. A dual-bit-line memory architecture incorporating a single-ended voltage-sensing scheme for fast data readout with just one access transistor per cell is also proposed for the first time. The technology-circuit cooptimization of the proposed single-transistor (1T) DP STT magnetic random access memory (MRAM) cell is carried out using effective mass-based transport simulations in nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and accurate micromagnetic simulations involving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. The proposed DP STT-MRAM bit cell outperforms a state-of-the-art 1T-1MTJ STT-MRAM cell in terms of higher cell tunneling magnetoresistance, simplified memory array architecture with a single supply for read/write, and significantly lower probability of disturb and access failures under parametric process variations with a marginal increase in critical switching current.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2116024","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5753310/05739108.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2116024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Terminal Dual-Pillar STT-MRAM for High-Performance Robust Memory Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Terminal Dual-Pillar STT-MRAM for High-Performance Robust Memory Applications","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739108/","accessionNumber":"11960669","volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Terminal Dual-Pillar STT-MRAM for High-Performance Robust Memory Applications","sourcePdf":"ted-mojumder-2116024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069756S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5753310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5753310","articleId":"5739108","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5739117,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Efstathopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5876025/5739117/5739117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Georgios Efstathopoulos (M'07) received the Diploma (with Hons.) degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in array communications and signal processing from Imperial College London in 2008, under the supervision of Prof. A.

The conventional array manifold is a function of the geometry of the array, the carrier frequency and the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the sources only. However, the emergence of more sophisticated array systems, for instance antenna array communication systems, dictates the extension of this array manifold into various new types of manifolds that incorporate additional system and channel parameters, such as the code-division multiple access (CDMA) (spreading and scrambling) codes, the lack of synchronization, Doppler effects, polarization parameters, subcarriers, etc. This paper is concerned with the definition and geometric investigation of a generic model for these new manifolds that can be expressed as functions of the conventional array manifolds and, hence, are defined herein as extended array manifolds. Thus, initially, the concept of the extended array manifold is introduced and is shown to accommodate both existing and newly defined extensions of the widely employed in the literature conventional (or spatial) array manifold. Next, the geometric properties and parameters of the extended array manifold are studied and linked with the properties of the associated spatial array manifold in an attempt to facilitate the geometric study of the former by taking advantage of the well understood study of the latter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Array Manifolds: Functions of Array Manifolds","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2132719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5876025/05739117.pdf","startPage":"3272","endPage":"3287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2132719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876025","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Extended Array Manifolds: Functions of Array Manifolds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5739117/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12060253","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Array Manifolds: Functions of Array Manifolds","sourcePdf":"tsp-efstathopoulos-2132719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09166S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5876025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5876025","articleId":"5739117","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739119,"authors":[{"name":"Didier Pinchon","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, University of Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5876025/5739119/5739119-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Didier Pinchon was born in Chaumont-en-Vexin, France, in February 1949.

Among this class of filter banks (FBs), the case of oversampled discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter banks is particularly important since it leads to efficient algorithm implementations. However, up to now, no general construction algorithm has been proposed to exhaustively cover the large set of the various solutions offered by this family of FBs. The paper recalls in detail the precise features of the rectangular paraunitary matrices that are specific of this type of systems. A parametrization method is proposed involving transformations, being either rotations or shifts, that depend upon the oversampling ratio and upon the prototype filter length. This shows that several factorizations exist leading to solutions of different dimension. Orthogonal and paraunitary patterns are introduced and, using a sequence of transformations applied to a pattern (STAP), an algorithm is derived that allows us to get the exhaustive set of solutions for various values of the oversampling ratio and prototype filter length. Furthermore, for some oversampling ratios, explicit expressions of some solutions are also provided that are valid whatever the maximum length of the prototype filter. Finally, design examples for linear and nonlinear phase prototype filters are presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2132718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5876025/05739119.pdf","startPage":"3058","endPage":"3070","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2132718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oversampled Paraunitary DFT Filter Banks: A General Construction Algorithm and Some Specific Solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Oversampled Paraunitary DFT Filter Banks: A General Construction Algorithm and Some Specific Solutions","volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5739119/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12060255","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampled Paraunitary DFT Filter Banks: A General Construction Algorithm and Some Specific Solutions","sourcePdf":"tsp-siohan-2132718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087232S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5876025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5876025","articleId":"5739119","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739124,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Instead of optimizing the controlled inputs to mimic expert human driver performance, we focus on understanding the stability and agility performance of the vehicle motion using professional racing car driver testing data. We propose to use the rear side slip angle, rather than the vehicle mass center side slip angle, as one state variable to obtain the precise stable region. A hybrid physical/dynamic tire/road friction model is used to capture the dynamic friction force characteristics. We also introduce the use of vehicle lateral jerk and acceleration information as the agility metrics to compare maneuvering performance under the racing car driver and a typical human driver. The analysis and testing results show that during the pendulum-turn maneuvers, the professional driver operates the vehicle outside the stable regions of the vehicle dynamics to achieve superior agility performance than that under typical human driver control. Comparison results also show that the racing car driver outperforms in both the traveling time and the agility metrics. It is ongoing work to design a control strategy for autonomous aggressive maneuvers by using the new stability and agility results presented in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739128/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12653850","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Stability and Agility of Aggressive Vehicle Maneuvers: A Pendulum-Turn Maneuver Example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Stability and Agility of Aggressive Vehicle Maneuvers: A Pendulum-Turn Maneuver Example","sourcePdf":"tcst-yi-2121908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076577S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6179396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6179396","articleId":"5739128","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5739129,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["Syst\u00e8mes et Applications des Technologies de lInformation et de l'Energie (SATIE), University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5762835/5739129/5739129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Monmasson (M'96\u2013SM'06) received the Ing. and Ph.D. degrees from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs d'Electrotechnique d'Electronique d'Informatique et d'Hydraulique de Toulouse (ENSEEIHT), Toulouse, France, in 1989 and 1993, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor and the Head of the Institut Universitaire Professionnalis\u00e9 de G\u00e9nie Electrique et d'Informatique Indutrielle (IUP GEII), University of Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France.

For the validation of this new theory, an experimental investigation was carried out on GaAs pseudomorphic HEMT devices and demonstrates that high output power and drain efficiency between 75%-83% can be achieved over a wide range of fundamental and second harmonic loads.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2117435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2117435","startPage":"1294","endPage":"1303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5765527/05739131.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Extension of the Continuous Class-F Mode Power Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Extension of the Continuous Class-F Mode Power Amplifier","volume":"59","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11976147","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739131/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Extension of the Continuous Class-F Mode Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tmtt-carrubba-2117435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.255882S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5765527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5765527","articleId":"5739131","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5739135,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5750164/5739135/5739135-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Wang received the B.A. degree in automatic control from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1997, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Delaware, Newark, in 2009.","He is currently a Post Doctor with the Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, under a National Research Council Research Associateship Award.

Significantly higher throughput is achievable if transmissions are scheduled. However, traditional methods to compute optimal schedules are computationally in tractable (unless co-channel interference is neglected). This paper presents a practical technique to compute optimal schedules. The resulting algorithm searches for a low-dimensional optimization problem that has the same solution as the full problem. Such a low-dimensional problem is shown to always exist. The resulting algorithm converges arithmetically fast or geometrically fast, de pending on whether the objective is to maximize the proportional fair throughput or to maximize the minimum throughput, where the minimum is over all flows in the network. At each iteration of the algorithm, a graph-theoretic optimization known as the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem must be solved. While the general MWIS problem is NP-hard in the worst case, we find that the MWIS can be solved efficiently. Specifically, computational experiments on over 17000 topologies indicate that the ratio of the time to solve the MWIS and the mean degree of the conflict graph grows polynomially with the number of nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","volume":"19","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11960332","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739135/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Practical Computation of Optimal Schedules in Multihop Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Computation of Optimal Schedules in Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-bohacek-2111462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144136S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5750164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5750164","articleId":"5739135","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739137,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Bifaretti","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5772087/5739137/5739137-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Bifaretti (M'07) was born in Rome, Italy, in 1974.

The sufficient and necessary condition for tightness of two bounds is presented. From the derived result, it can be observed that in-cell receiver cooperation does not help in most of the cases in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel (IFC) except for one special case. Even for that special case, the DOFs with and without in-cell receive cooperation approach the same value for large K. Also, in a MIMO IFC with symmetric antenna settings (i.e., M = K), if both transmit and receive cooperations are removed to make it a single-input single-output (SISO) IFC, we show that the DOF is not affected. In addition, the DOF is studied for two mutually interfering broadcast channels in the presence of a cognitive BS. We obtain an interesting result that disabling in-cell receive cooperation of the MIMO IFC causes no DOF loss if at least one of two transmitters is a cognitive BS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of Multiple Broadcast Channels in the Presence of Inter-Cell Interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.031611.090428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05739160.pdf","startPage":"1481","endPage":"1487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.031611.090428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of Multiple Broadcast Channels in the Presence of Inter-Cell Interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5739160/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988528","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom of Multiple Broadcast Channels in the Presence of Inter-Cell Interference","sourcePdf":"1481-tc1105-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083111S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5739160","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5739161,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Galli","affiliation":["ASSIA, Inc., Redwood Shores, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5766667/5739161/5739161-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Galli (S'95-M'98-SM'05) received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d (Italy) in 1994 and 1998, respectively.

Further analysis of other wireline channels allows us to report a strong similarity between some properties observed in power line channels and the ones observed in other wireline channels, e.g. coaxial cables and phone lines. For example, it is here reported that channel power gain and logarithm of the RMS-DS in DSL links are linearly correlated random variables. Exploiting these results, we here propose a statistical wireline channel model where tap amplitudes and delays are generated in order to reflect these physical properties. Although wireline channels are considered deterministic as their impulse response can be readily calculated once the link topology is known, a statistical wireline channel model is useful because the variability of link topologies and wiring practices give rise to a stochastic aspect of wireline communications that has not been well characterized in the literature. Finally, we also point out that alternative channel models that normalize impulse responses to a common (often unitary) power gain may be misleading when assessing the performance of equalization schemes since this normalization artificially removes the correlation between channel power gain and RMS-DS and, thus, Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.031611.090692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05739161.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to the Statistical Modeling of Wireline Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739161/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to the Statistical Modeling of Wireline Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988529","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to the Statistical Modeling of Wireline Channels","sourcePdf":"1332-tc1105-galli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101692S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5739161","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5739162,"authors":[{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5766667/5739162/5739162-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiqi Gao (SM'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1997.

Aimed at SC-FDMA applications, a cyclic prefixed version of the offset quadrature amplitude modulation based OFDM (OQAM-OFDM) is first proposed in this paper. We show that cyclic prefixed OQAM-OFDM (CP-OQAM-OFDM) can be realized within the framework of the standard OFDM system, and perfect recovery condition in the ideal channel is derived. We then apply CP-OQAM-OFDM to SC-FDMA transmission in frequency selective fading channels. Signal model and joint widely linear minimum mean square error (WLMMSE) equalization using a prior information with low complexity are developed. Compared with the existing DFTS-OFDM based SC-FDMA, the proposed SC-FDMA can significantly reduce envelope fluctuation (EF) of the transmitted signal while maintaining the bandwidth efficiency. The inherent structure of CP-OQAM-OFDM enables low-complexity joint equalization in the frequency domain to combat both the multiple access interference and the intersymbol interference. The joint WLMMSE equalization using a prior information guarantees optimal MMSE performance and supports Turbo receiver for improved bit error rate (BER) perform BER) performance. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SC-FDMA in terms of EF (including peak-to-average power ratio, instantaneous-to-average power ratio and cubic metric) and BER performances.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.031611.100045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5766667/05739162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.031611.100045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5766667","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic Prefixed OQAM-OFDM and its Application to Single-Carrier FDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic Prefixed OQAM-OFDM and its Application to Single-Carrier FDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988530","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739162/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic Prefixed OQAM-OFDM and its Application to Single-Carrier FDMA","sourcePdf":"1467-tc1105-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18785S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5766667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5766667","articleId":"5739162","onlineDate":"24 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5739163,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Dai","affiliation":["Datang Mobile Communications Equipment Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Dai","id":"37537845200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5739163","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Gallium","Radio frequency","Convergence","Measurement","Correlation","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","convergence","correlation methods","diversity reception","genetic algorithms","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Allele gene based adaptive genetic algorithm","code design","allele gene adaptive mutation","schemata crossover operator","population diversity","convergence capability","AGAM","universal mobile telecommunication system","time division duplex mode","autocorrelation","crosscorrelation property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Allele gene based adaptive genetic algorithm (AGAGA)","allele gene adaptive mutation (AGAM)","schemata crossover (SC)","universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739163","abstract":"In this work, an allele gene adaptive mutation (AGAM) and a schemata crossover (SC) operators are designed to improve the performance of the conventional genetic algorithm (GA) and applied to the code design. Specifically, the proposed AGAM exploits both global and local information of the population to maintain an appropriate level of diversity throughout the search process. The SC utilizes high-performance schemata to enhance the traditional crossover operation. The combination of the AGAM and SC achieves both goals of maintaining population diversity and simultaneously sustaining the convergence capability of the GA. As a result, the SC and AGAM based genetic algorithm alleviates the inherent premature convergence of the GA, thus significantly increasing the chance of locating the global optimal solution.

The method aims to achieve robust OFDM channel estimation from the canonical state space models with (i) a state equation composed of the channel gain and (ii) an observation equation composed of the pilot signal, the channel gain, and the additive noise. The remarkable features of this method are that (1) the channel gain estimation accuracy does not depend on the parameter of the AR system, (2) the maximum Doppler frequency is unknown, and (3) the proposed method can estimate the channel gain by low computational complexity, while many conventional methods based on the Kalman filter theory usually perform the channel gain estimation using the parameter estimation algorithm of the AR (auto-regressive) system and the Kalman filter algorithm. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739180","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739180.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical OFDM channel estimation method with Kalman filter theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739180/","displayDocTitle":"Practical OFDM channel estimation method with Kalman filter theory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887116","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739180/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical OFDM channel estimation method with Kalman filter theory","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07713S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5739182,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Rashidi","affiliation":["Department of Signal & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Rashidi","id":"37601714100"},{"name":"Kasra Haghighi","affiliation":["Department of Signal & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kasra","lastName":"Haghighi","id":"37534631600"},{"name":"Arash Owrang","affiliation":["Department of Signal & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Owrang","id":"37846216600"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Department of Signal & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37268515700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-227-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-226-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-225-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739182","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":918},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Sensors","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","correlation methods","matrix algebra","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband spectrum sensing method","cognitive radio","sub-Nyquist sampling scheme","substantial savings","correlation matrix","subspace estimator","signal properties","signal detection","low SNR","randomly generated signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wideband spectrum sensing","Sub-Nyquist sampling","Cognitive radio","Correlation matrix","Subspace methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739182","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739182.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio using sub-Nyquist sampling","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is a fundamental component in cognitive radio. A major challenge in this area is the requirement of a high sampling rate in the sensing of a wideband signal. In this paper a wideband spectrum sensing model is presented that utilizes a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme to bring substantial savings in terms of the sampling rate. The correlation matrix of a finite number of noisy samples is computed and used by a subspace estimator to detect the occupied and vacant channels of the spectrum. In contrast with common methods, the proposed method does not need the knowledge of signal properties that mitigates the uncertainty problem. We evaluate the performance of this method by computing the probability of detecting signal occupancy in terms of the number of samples and the SNR of randomly generated signals. The results show a reliable detection even in low SNR and small number of samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739182/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11887118","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739182/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A wideband spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio using sub-Nyquist sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio using sub-Nyquist sampling","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06936S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5739183,"authors":[{"name":"Malik Muhammad Usman Gul","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Malik Muhammad Usman","lastName":"Gul","id":"37863126300"},{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Sungeun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407202900"},{"name":"Xiaoli Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279528400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-227-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-226-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-225-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739183","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Estimation","Silicon","Resource management","Cost function","Interference","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","interference suppression","telecommunication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["null subcarrier based carrier frequency offset estimation","OFDMA uplink system","multiuser interference","CFO acquisition range","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Synchronization"]}],"abstract":"We propose a null sub-carrier based carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation technique for OFDMA uplink systems.

While the asymptotically optimal MAE equalizer is very attractive in its low runtime complexity, it suffers from high (exponential in channel and equalizer length) design complexity. Frequent redesign renders the effective operational complexity of the MAE equalizer impractical for implementation in time-varying channels. In this work, we address this issue by mapping the time-varying channel to a fixed channel for which the MAE equalizer is pre-designed. The channel mapping is performed via a linear pre-filter. Simulation results reveal that a pre-filter followed by a fixed MAE equalizer achieves gains of up to 4 dB over a conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear equalizer in the high SNR regime. The proposed adaptive equalizer provides a balance between the optimal bit error rate performance and design complexity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739184","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739184.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive maximal asymptotic efficiency equalization using constellation mapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive maximal asymptotic efficiency equalization using constellation mapping","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887120","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739184/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive maximal asymptotic efficiency equalization using constellation mapping","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046441S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5739185,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry Malone","affiliation":["Transportation Technology Center, Inc., Pueblo, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry","lastName":"Malone","id":"37843947100"},{"name":"Mark A.

The nonlinear nature of Volterra filters would seem to make them a natural choice for canceling intersymbol interference (ISI) resulting from these distortions. Preliminary results of simulation studies using QPSK with up to 5th-order adaptive Volterra kernels filter are presented. The practical aspect of this work is that we would like to achieve good performance while reducing computational complexity, ultimately making efficient implementation on an FPGA feasible. It was found that an LMS adaptive Volterra filter offered significant ISI reduction only at relatively high SNRs (~25 dB), while at lower (and more typical) SNRs, improvement was only marginal, as noise tended to dominate the LMS algorithm. Adding a 5th-order Volterra kernel to the linear and 3rd-order LMS kernels offered negligible improvement in performance over the linear and 3rd-order kernels alone.","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739185","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739185.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Volterra equalizers for wideband satellite communications with TWTA nonlinearities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical Volterra equalizers for wideband satellite communications with TWTA nonlinearities","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739185/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887121","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739185/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Volterra equalizers for wideband satellite communications with TWTA nonlinearities","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04024S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739190,"authors":[{"name":"Todd D.

The elements of the cross-spectral matrices are most commonly estimated using the Welch's method of weighted overlapped segment averaging. The segment length is restricted by the length of the mixing channel impulse responses which might be exceedingly long depending on the reverberation characteristics of the room. However, long effective data lengths risk averaging over non-stationary segments, cause higher estimation errors and large processing delays, and imperil the exploitation of non-stationarity in adjoining frames. This paper discusses the cross-spectral matrix estimation in the orthogonal multitaper framework, where a single segment of data is used for each cross-spectral matrix by averaging direct estimates over multiple windows or tapers. Four different nonparametric cross-spectrum estimators that fall into this framework are compared via numerical simulations involving convolutively mixed speech signals with premeasured room impulse responses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of cross-spectrum estimation in convolutive blind source separation: A comparative study","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739198","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739198.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effects of cross-spectrum estimation in convolutive blind source separation: A comparative study","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739198/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887134","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of cross-spectrum estimation in convolutive blind source separation: A comparative study","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042463S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5739221,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Gogineni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Gogineni","id":"37396660200"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-227-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-226-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-225-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739221","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination sensing using sparse modeling","abstract":"Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are becoming a common ingredient in many modern day lighting systems as they are capable of producing high intensity light across a wide spread of frequencies. To efficiently obtain desired lighting effects, it is important to sense the light received across different target locations and estimate its unknown properties (amplitudes, frequency offsets and phases) to design the driving waveforms for the LEDs. This procedure is known as illumination sensing and it enables efficient and effective usage of light energy to achieve the intended lighting effects. We propose a novel two-step approach to perform this estimation using sparse modeling which exploits the fact that the measurements at the sensors are sparse in the frequency offset space and the phase space. We show that exploiting this knowledge of sparsity will provide accurate estimates of the desired parameters.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739221.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739221","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739221","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739221","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency estimation","Estimation","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["daylighting","light emitting diodes","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination sensing","sparse modeling","light emitting diode","LED","day lighting system","high intensity light","sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Illumination sensing","LED","sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739221/","displayDocTitle":"Illumination sensing using sparse modeling","accessionNumber":"11887157","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739221/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination sensing using sparse modeling","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078095S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5739222,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Owrang","affiliation":["Department of Signals & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Owrang","id":"37846216600"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Department of Signals & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37268515700"},{"name":"Mohsen Nosratinia","affiliation":["Department of Signals & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Nosratinia","id":"37547374300"},{"name":"Moslem Rashidi","affiliation":["Department of Signals & Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Rashidi","id":"37601714100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-227-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-226-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-225-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739222","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739222","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Cost function","Niobium","Least squares approximation","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","quantisation (signal)","set theory","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal periodic sampling pattern","signal reconstruction","cyclic nonuniform sample","Nyquist rate","signal perturbation","signal amplification","quantization","sparse reconstruction","equivalent subDFT matrix","sparse subset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse approximation","Basis Pursuit","condition number","nonuniform sampling","greedy search"]}],"abstract":"It is possible to reconstruct a signal from cyclic nonuniform samples and thus take advantage of a lower sampling rate than the Nyquist rate.

Besides, our algorithm has low complexity in terms of computation.

Two uniform samplers with sample spacings MT and NT are used where M and N are coprime and T has the dimension of space or time. By considering the difference set of this pair of sample spacings (which arise naturally in computation of second order moments), sample locations which are O(MN) consecutive multiples of T can be generated using only O(M + N) physical samples. In order to efficiently use these O(MN) virtual samples for super resolution spectral estimation, a novel algorithm based on the idea of spatial smoothing is proposed, which can be used for estimating frequencies of sinusoids buried in noise as well as for estimating Directions-of-Arrival (DOA) of impinging signals on a sensor array.

We developed a unique implementation of compressive sensing that is based on converting the signal to a time-encoded representation. The time encoding process converts an analog signal that has a continuous voltage range to a binary amplitude signal. In a time encoded signal representation, the important information is captured in the time points - the points where zero-crossing occur.

It can be shown that the difference coarray of this pair of sampling arrays has elements at all integer multiples of T, regardless of how large M and N are. This implies that any application which depends only on second order statistics, such as angle of arrival estimation, beamforming, and multiple frequency detection, can be carried out at high resolution with the help of sparse sampling arrays. One manifestation is that two sensor arrays withM and N sensors can actually identify O(MN) independent sources. This paper extends these results to the case of multidimensional signals. The multidimensional sampling arrays operate on a lattice geometry. The coarray of such a system is studied. Even though the two lattice arrays are sparse (with respect to the integer grid), the coarray contains all integer vectors. It is also shown how to achieve the effect of a high resolution multidimensional DFT filter bank by combining coprime low resolution filter banks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739252/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887187","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sparse coprime sensing with multidimensional lattice arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse coprime sensing with multidimensional lattice arrays","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.199224S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5739259,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We demonstrate our results using a realistic urban environment, by varying the regions of obscuration and the number of bounce path returns. An important advantage of the MIMO system is that, based on the radar configuration, it is possible to completely eliminate the obscuration regions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739259.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"471","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform-agile mimo radar for urban terrain tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","Receivers","Transmitters","MIMO radar","MIMO","Target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","radar tracking","remote sensing by radar","sensors","target tracking","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform-agile MIMO radar","urban terrain tracking","moving target tracking","multiple-input and multiple-output radar system","MIMO widely-separated radar sensors","mean-squared tracking error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Urban terrain","multipath exploitation","MIMO radar","tracking","waveform optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Waveform-agile mimo radar for urban terrain tracking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887194","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform-agile mimo radar for urban terrain tracking","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05477S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739262,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Two possible system architectures are detailed, where one uses the cellular channel and the other uses the data channel. Consequently, one of the approaches is adopted and a detailed simulation is done where an Android client device is shown communicating with a server running openCV and using the Haar face-detection algorithm. The work assures the credibility of the adopted system architecture, in terms of deployment, and several future lines of work are proposed.","doi":"10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739270","publicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5731631/5739176/05739270.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739176","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile cloud computing educational tool for image/video processing algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739270/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile cloud computing educational tool for image/video processing algorithms","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739270/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887205","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile cloud computing educational tool for image/video processing algorithms","confLoc":"Sedona, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"0000529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057042S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5731631","isNumber":"5739176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5731631","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5739176","articleId":"5739270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739286,"authors":[{"name":"T A Anjit","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication College of Engineering, Kerala University, Trivandrum, India"],"firstName":"T A","lastName":"Anjit","id":"37846170200"},{"name":"S Rishidas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication College of Engineering, Kerala University, Trivandrum, India"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Rishidas","id":"37846169600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9799-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9797-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739286","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","diseases","image texture","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nasal bone identification","down syndrome early detection","back propagation neural network","pregnancy","ultrasonogram","visual identification","foetus","gestation","image texture parameter","transform domain","spatial domain","discrete cosine transform","Daubechies D4 wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Down Syndrome","Feature extraction","DCT","Wavelet decomposition","Back Propagation Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739286","abstract":"Down Syndrome is characterized by the absence of nasal bone during the late first trimester of pregnancy. Presently Downsyndrome is identified by visually examining the ultra sonogram of foetus of 11 to 13 weeks of gestation for the presence of nasal bone. Nasal bone is visually identified by differentiating the change in the contrast of nasal region of ultrasonogram. This method is prone to operator error as the nasal bone is a very small physical structure during the first trimester of pregnancy. Noise also introduce error during visual identification. This paper presents a new approach for the detection of nasal bone for ultrasonogram of foetus of 11 to 13 weeks of gestation. The proposed method is based on the extraction of image texture parameter of nasal bone region of ultra sonogram and their subsequent classification using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The features in the nasal region are extracted in the Spatial domain and Transform domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Daubechies D4 Wavelet transform. These features are extracted from images with nasal bone and images which don't have nasal bone. The extracted data is normalized and used to train Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The trained BPNN is used to classify random ultrasonograms. The result shows that the proposed method can detect down syndrome with higher degree of accuracy. This method combined with the present detection methods can reduce operator error and overall enhance the down syndrome detection rate by analysing ultra sonogram.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739286","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739286.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of nasal bone for the early detection of down syndrome using Back Propagation Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Identification of nasal bone for the early detection of down syndrome using Back Propagation Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11887521","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739286/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of nasal bone for the early detection of down syndrome using Back Propagation Neural Network","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057835S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5739288,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Multimedia data protection has become a very important issue which needs to be addressed at the earliest. In this paper we have proposed a multimedia data protection technique for audio files. There exists various audio watermarking techniques in the literature. In this paper we propose a wavelet based watermarking technique where embedding is performed on the third level detail wavelet coefficients. The robustness of the scheme is found to be at an acceptable level with respect to some of the existing techniques in wavelet domain. The proposed method is essentially an improvement of the works reported in [1], [2], where the bit rates of the watermark data are enhanced with modest degradation in robustness. Subjective tests have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739291.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"164","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving bitrate in detail coefficient based audio watermarking using wavelet transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Variable speed drives","Rocks","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio watermarking","error statistics","multimedia communication","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit rate","wavelet transformation","multimedia content","multimedia data protection technique","audio files","wavelet based audio watermarking technique","wavelet coefficients","watermark data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving bitrate in detail coefficient based audio watermarking using wavelet transformation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887526","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving bitrate in detail coefficient based audio watermarking using wavelet transformation","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085065S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5739292,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

We bring out the exact dependence of vehicle speed statistics on VANET connectivity. We also present the dependence of vehicle speed statistics on both the node isolation probability as well as the critical transmission range required to maintain the desired connectivity probability. The results show that when the vehicle transmission range increases, the network connectivity also gets increased. The results also show that the network connectivity gets degraded when the average vehicle speed increases. Further, as the average speed increases, the critical transmission range required to meet a given connectivity probability criterion increases. On the other hand, when the standard deviation of vehicle speed increases, the network connectivity gets improved. It is also shown that, for a given connectivity probability requirement, the critical transmission range decreases as the standard deviation of the speed increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11887546","htmlLink":"/document/5739311/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Network connectivity of one-dimensional Vehicular Ad hoc Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network connectivity of one-dimensional Vehicular Ad hoc Network","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048769S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739313,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A cognitive radio designer's intent, knowledge about the critical issues and trade-offs underlying in a particular design are implicit in the simulations set up. However, this knowledge is tightly conjoined with specific features and a thorough simulation analysis is essential. Towards this, an algorithm was developed for performing this distributed sensing method between neighboring terminals in a network. VHF TV Broadcast FM Broadcast and GSM systems were investigated as possible candidates of primary users. It was found that a high degree of detection probability could be obtained for the TV and FM broadcast systems than for GSM systems under the same environmental parameters, largely due to the higher transmit powers involved in broadcast networks. The probability of false detection cannot be completely negated without risking an increase in the probability of non-detection of a present primary system. Hence a trade-off can be shown to exist between these two probabilities. It can be concluded that minimizing the possibility of interference to primary users should take priority in this scenario.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","startPage":"250","endPage":"254","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739313.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration of a distributed approach for simulating spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739313/","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of a distributed approach for simulating spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887548","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of a distributed approach for simulating spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070018S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5739314,"authors":[{"name":"Vamadevan Namboodiri","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, India","WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Vamadevan","lastName":"Namboodiri","id":"37862327900"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, India"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37857568700"},{"name":"Predrag Spasojevic\u0300","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Spasojevic\u0300","id":"37085946645"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9799-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9797-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739314","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"abstract":"Turbo equalization schemes based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria available in the literature for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are computationally expensive as they require a relatively large matrix inversion.

TE-SIC-MIMO leverages on the soft feedback symbol estimate to remove the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and co-antenna interference (CAI) from the received data thus turning the system matrix into an easily invertable form.

At the receiver side, the challenge resides in designing low complexity detection algorithms capable of separating independent streams sent simultaneously from different antennas. In this paper, we propose a novel combined low complexity QRD-M (LQRD-M) and decision feedback equalization (DFE) MIMO detector that combines the feature of QRD-M detector and DFE detector. The original QRDM algorithm decomposes the MIMO channel matrix into upper triangular matrix and applies a limited tree search. To accomplish near-MLD(Maximum Likelihood Detection) performance for QRD-M algorithm, number of search points at each layer must be the modulation size. In the proposed scheme, each of survival branches are extended only to the corresponding QR decomposition (QRD)-based detection symbol in the next layer and its neighboring symbols in the constellation. In our detection technique with L transmit antennas, after LQRD-M detection is executed for first T detection steps, DFE detection is executed for last M - T detection steps. This approach is simple and has low complexity, because the computations for LQRD-M is limited by the newly adopted parameter T. From simulation results, the complexity of the proposed technique with 8 \u00d7 8 and T = 2 is reduced by 36% compared with that of QRDM-DFE algorithm at the expense of about 0.8dB in degradation of BER performance at BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739321.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"293","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of combined low complexity QRD-M and DFE detection in MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","matrix decomposition","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transmitting antennas","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output technology","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel capacity","complexity detection algorithm","low complexity QRD-M detection","decision feedback equalization detection","channel matrix","tree search","maximum likelihood detection","transmit antennas","BER performance","gain 0.8 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM)","QR-decomposition","QRD-M algorithm","low complexity QRD-M algorithm","DFE detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of combined low complexity QRD-M and DFE detection in MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887556","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of combined low complexity QRD-M and DFE detection in MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05898S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5739327,"authors":[{"name":"Patric Beinschob","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr, Hamburg"],"firstName":"Patric","lastName":"Beinschob","id":"37396243600"},{"name":"Udo Z\u00f6lzer","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Signal Processing, Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Udo","lastName":"Z\u00f6lzer","id":"37376321800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9799-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9797-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739327","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","channel estimation","computational complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictor performance","decision-directed channel estimation schemes","3GPP MIMO channels","OFDM-based multiantenna systems","MIMO detection","mobile terminals","3GPP spatial channel model","signal to noise ratios","computational complexity","time variant channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO OFDM","Channel Estimation","Prediction","Signal Processing"]}],"abstract":"OFDM-based multi antenna systems suffer from inaccurate channel estimates in time variant channels which lead eventually to performance degradation. Decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) schemes have been proposed to reduce the number of reference symbols. A prediction of channel coefficients is necessary for MIMO detection, whose output is used to acquire new channel estimates recursively. Three approaches to predict channel coefficients are investigated in this work. For validation simulation were conducted with the 3GPP spatial channel model. Channel estimation and prediction accuracy for mobile terminals in a range of velocities and Signal to Noise Ratios were evaluated. Even though the predictors vary strong in computational complexity it is shown in this work the performance benefit of complicated approaches remains small in a variety of channel states.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739327","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739327.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictor performance of decision-directed channel estimation in 3GPP MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739327/","displayDocTitle":"Predictor performance of decision-directed channel estimation in 3GPP MIMO channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887562","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739327/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictor performance of decision-directed channel estimation in 3GPP MIMO channels","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044111S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5739333,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University Xi'an, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Liang Zhou","id":"37852455800"},{"name":"Xiaohui Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University Xi'an, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Li","id":"37836093300"},{"name":"Yongqiang Hei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yongqiang Hei","id":"37870280100"},{"name":"Guanghui Yu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, ZTE Corporation Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Guanghui Yu","id":"37288513700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9799-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9797-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739333","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel orthogonalization precoding algorithm","multiuser MIMO downlink system","Schmidt orthogonalization method","signal to interference plus noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","downlink","co-channel interference (CCI)","channel orthogonalization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, two precoding algorithms based on channel orthogonalization have been proposed for multi-user MIMO downlink systems. Unlike other conventional methods, the first scheme obtains the orthonormal basis to achieve the precoding matrix by means of using Schmidt Orthogonalization method. In this way, the co-channel interference can be eliminated to some degree. The second algorithm increases every user's receive SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) by taking noise into account to balance the multi-user interference and the noise for every user. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed schemes is very close to the conventional iterative scheme but significantly reduce the complexity with one data stream per user. For systems with multiple data streams per user, the second algorithm achieves better BER performance compared with several other algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel orthogonalization precoding algorithms for multiuser MIMO downlink systems","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739333","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739333.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel orthogonalization precoding algorithms for multiuser MIMO downlink systems","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739333/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887568","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel orthogonalization precoding algorithms for multiuser MIMO downlink systems","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061701S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739345,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Neelakanta Iyer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Ganesh Neelakanta Iyer","id":"38236029800"},{"name":"Yun Cai Lim","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yun Cai Lim","id":"38257292600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9799-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9797-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739345","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical saturation","Computational modeling","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","mobile ad hoc networks","optimisation","radio spectrum management","telecommunication congestion control","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC protocol","TDMA","cognitive radio networks","medium access control","spectrum sensing","packet scheduling","mobile ad hoc networks","collision handling","multi-channel allocation","optimization","weighted bipartite graph matching","weighted bipartite multi-vertex matching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739345","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739345","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","abstract":"We propose a cross-layer based multi-channel Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to maximize the utilization of the leftover spectrum of primary user channels in cognitive radio networks.

As a method to improve the parameter convergence speed in the predistorter, a series expansion technique with an orthogonal polynomials has been investigated. In this paper, we present an adaptive predistortion linearization method based on orthogonal polynomial expansion for a nonlinear power amplifier affected by memory effect in OFDM systems, where both memory and memoryless predistorter are constructed by the weighted sum of orthogonal polynomials. In addition, to achieve the parameter optimization speed improvement of the predistorter, we propose a method to determine step-size in a recursive calculation. The parameter convergence performance of the predistorter is investigated in OFDM systems with and without peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction, where the partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique is employed to reduce PAPR. Computer simulation results show that the proposed adaptive predistorter achieves faster parameter convergence time than that of non-orthogonal one in OFDM systems with nonlinear power amplifier affected by memory effect, even though PAPR of OFDM signal is reduced by using PTS. It is also confirmed that power added efficiency is further improved by combining the adaptive predistortion with PAPR reduction technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive predistortion linearization based on orthogonal polynomial expansion for nonlinear power amplifiers in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739374","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739374.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive predistortion linearization based on orthogonal polynomial expansion for nonlinear power amplifiers in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739374/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887608","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive predistortion linearization based on orthogonal polynomial expansion for nonlinear power amplifiers in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068054S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5739392,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As the configurations of interest, in this paper, have dipoles oriented in different directions, the channel model for multi-polarized antennas is used in the simulations. The polarization change at every scatterer is included using a dyad. The performances of arrays are evaluated using capacity as the metric. The mutual coupling between the dipoles of different orientations is also included to make simulation more realistic. Here we used Method of Moment (MOM) solution for the printed dipole mutual coupling impedance calculation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733985/5739277/05739410.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Communications and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2011.5739410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of echelon, H-shaped, V-shaped and printed dipole arrays in MIMO system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","dipole antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","electromagnetic wave scattering","method of moments","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H-shaped printed dipole arrays","V-shaped printed dipole arrays","MIMO system","V-shaped free standing dipole","H-shaped free standing dipole","channel model","multipolarized antenna","method of moment solution","printed dipole mutual coupling impedance calculation","Echelon capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Printed dipole","dipole configurations","MIMO","One ring Model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of echelon, H-shaped, V-shaped and printed dipole arrays in MIMO system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739410/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11887644","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of echelon, H-shaped, V-shaped and printed dipole arrays in MIMO system","confLoc":"Kerala, India","sourcePdf":"paper93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.468202S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733985","isNumber":"5739277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733985","xplore-issue":"5739277","articleId":"5739410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5739411,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Joy","affiliation":["DA-IICT, India"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Joy","id":"37710201200"},{"name":"Vijaykumar Chakka","affiliation":["DA-IICT, India"],"firstName":"Vijaykumar","lastName":"Chakka","id":"37410981200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9799-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9798-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9797-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5739411","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","quadrature phase shift keying","radio transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMS","NLMS","transceiver filters","MIMO","two way relaying scheme","relay station","least mean square algorithm","amplify and forward scheme","channel state information","quadrature phase shift keying","mean square error method","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","LMS","NLMS","two-way relaying"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a MIMO two-way relaying scheme where the transceiver filter at the Relay Station (RS) processes the data using Least Mean Square Algorithm (LMS) and Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithm.

In this paper, a simulation model for spherical cavities within a homogeneous dielectric material has been developed. The model is implemented using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software in parallel with a mathematical package. This method provides many advantages over previous PD models because discharge events can be simulated dynamically and the electric field in the cavity can be calculated numerically. The model has been used to study the effect of different amplitudes and frequencies of the applied voltage and simulation results have been compared with experimental measurement results. It is found that certain model parameters are dependent on the applied stress and parameters that clearly affect PD activity can be readily identified, these parameters include; the electron detrapping time constant, the cavity surface conductivity, the initial electron generation rate and the extinction voltage. The influence of surface charge decay through conduction along the cavity wall on PD activity has also been studied.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2011.5739447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739435","startPage":"432","endPage":"443","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5739435/05739447.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2011.5739447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial discharge behavior within a spherical cavity in a solid dielectric material as a function of frequency and amplitude of the applied voltage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Partial discharges","Mathematical model","Discharges","Surface discharges","Electric fields","Surface treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","finite element analysis","partial discharge measurement","voids (solid)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge process","spherical cavity","solid dielectric material","simulation model","homogeneous dielectric material","finite element analysis software","mathematical package","PD model","electric field","electron detrapping time constant","cavity surface conductivity","initial electron generation rate","surface charge decay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial discharges","finite element analysis"," insulation diagnostics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge behavior within a spherical cavity in a solid dielectric material as a function of frequency and amplitude of the applied voltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5739447/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11903707","publicationDate":"April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge behavior within a spherical cavity in a solid dielectric material as a function of frequency and amplitude of the applied voltage","sourcePdf":"p0432-lllias.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075786S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5739435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5739435","articleId":"5739447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":5739454,"authors":[{"name":"Huaren Wu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Automation Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/5739435/5739454/5739454-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaren Wu (M'04) was born in Jiangxi, China, in 1956.

Although it provides more secure, robust and power efficient system than traditional Electro-Magnetic (EM) RF-based systems, its capabilities and characteristics have not been widely studied. Therefore, in this paper, we have explored this technology from the link budget perspective, since this concept is one of the most fundamental requirements of any communication system. An efficient link budget is critical to the NFMIC systems where the power decreases with distance with higher rate than RF-based systems. We have thus examined the impacts of two channel models of Agbinya-Masihpour (AM) and Agbinya-Masihpour1 (AM1), which we have developed. We present these two models based on a common formalism. Then we have compared the performance of the two models in three different frequency bands 13.56MHz, 300MHz and 900MHz. According to the theoretical analysis as well as simulation results we have shown that the Agbinya-Masihpour model performs much higher than the Agbinya-Masihpour 1 model specifically in higher frequencies. The results suggest that longer distances are achievable through the Agbinya-Masihpour channel model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5739497/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11883907","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic induction channel models and link budgets: A comparison between two Agbinya-Masihpour models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic induction channel models and link budgets: A comparison between two Agbinya-Masihpour models","confLoc":"Nha Trang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"16692_pp 400-405_17-Mar-2011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032694S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5661636","isNumber":"5670640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5661636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5670640","articleId":"5739497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5739498,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad R.

This paper investigates the performance of the integrated carrier when specific service bundles (SBs) with bandwidth guarantee and diverse quality of service requirements are provisioned. We first present a novel framework that fairly distributes the upstream network capacity among the different SBs. We then propose a novel delay-based admission control scheme to increase the network utilization and enable an inter-SB statistical multiplexing. To obtain the expected delay of each SB stream, a generic analytical model is developed. Based on this model, we further formulate some important performance measures such as queuing delay, end-to-end (from wireless user to the central office of PON) delay, average queue size and optimal orthogonal frequency division multiplexing frame length. Numerical results validate our analysis and highlight the advantages of the proposed solution.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5753252/05739498.pdf","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1513","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2132753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2132753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS Control for Guaranteed Service Bundles Over Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) Broadband Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2011","displayDocTitle":"QoS Control for Guaranteed Service Bundles Over Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) Broadband Access Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5739498/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2011","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","accessionNumber":"11970621","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS Control for Guaranteed Service Bundles Over Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) Broadband Access Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-dhaini-2132753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163971S","chronDate":"May15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5753252","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5753252","articleId":"5739498","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739500,"authors":[{"name":"Nestor D.

In this paper, to achieve perceptually pleasant results, an image inpainting technique in which structure information generated from edge information is adopted as the spatial error concealment method. In addition, a modified boundary matching algorithm for temporal error concealment is proposed for temporal frames. To maintain low hardware costs as regards the error concealment engine, the processing iteration number of each macroblock is limited to four based on the proposed inpainting algorithm. Block-based pipeline scheduling is also proposed to reduce the number of processing cycles and the on-chip memory size. Moreover, a cache-based data reuse scheme is developed to reduce the processing cycles and external bandwidth. Moreover, the two concealment modes share the same computational core to reduce hardware costs. A prototype chip is implemented by using the UMC 90 nm process. The total gate count is approximately 121 k at 200 MHz. The maximum processing capability can support 244.8 k macroblocks per second or 1920 \u00d7 1080 4:2:0 30 Hz video.

To achieve the largest coding gain with controlled perceptual quality degradation, a perceptual weighting scheme is deployed wherein the compressed video is weighted as a function of visual saliency and of the non-uniform distribution of retinal photoreceptors. We develop a resource allocation algorithm emphasizing both efficiency and fairness by controlling the size of the salient region in each quality layer. Efficiency is emphasized on the low quality layer of the SVC. The bits saved by eliminating perceptual redundancy in regions of low interest are allocated to lower block-level distortions in salient regions. Fairness is enforced on the higher quality layers by enlarging the size of the salient regions. The simulation results show that the proposed VSVC framework significantly improves the subjective visual quality of compressed videos.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Encoding","Resource management","Static VAr compensators","Retina","Bit rate","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptually scalable extension","visual scalable video coding","H.264/AVC","VSVC","video codec","visual saliency","retinal photoreceptors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency weighting","H264/AVC","human visual system","perceptual coding","scalable video coding","visual attention"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2133370","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6062602/05739513.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2133370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptually Scalable Extension of H.264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Perceptually Scalable Extension of H.264","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12328544","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","volume":"21","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739513/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptually Scalable Extension of H.264","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lee-2133370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110784S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6062602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6062602","articleId":"5739513","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739514,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The proposed system applies principal component neural network (PCNN) with generalized Hebbian learning for extracting eigenfaces from the face database. It demonstrates a recognition performance of more than 85% when evaluated on the benchmark Yale and FRGC databases containing images with varying illumination and expression. Unlike the existing face recognition systems, the proposed approach not only recognizes the faces using computed eigenfaces, but also updates eigenfaces automatically whenever the face database changes. The challenge, however, lies in hardware realization of the PCNN-based face recognition system. In the presence of computation-intensive steps of varying nature, it is not straightforward to map the overall computation to a single systolic architecture. A primary contribution of this paper from the architecture point of view is an optimized mapping of fine-grained systolized signal flow graphs (SFGs) for each individual step of the algorithm on to a single self-configurable linear systolic array by appropriate merging of the computations pertaining to different nodes of different SFGs. The architecture has the flexibility of processing face images and databases of any size and it is easily scalable with the number of eigenfaces to be computed. The proposed PCNN-based systolic face recognition system has been implemented and evaluated on a Xilinx ML403 evaluation platform with Virtex-4 XC4VFX12 FPGA. The FPGA-based design for a reasonably large-sized face database can process more than 400 faces in a video image frame which is fast enough for video surveillance in busy public places and sensitive locations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205134","htmlLink":"/document/5739514/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Self-Configurable Systolic Architecture for Face Recognition System Based on Principal Component Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Configurable Systolic Architecture for Face Recognition System Based on Principal Component Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-sudha-2133210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113687S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5970267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5970267","articleId":"5739514","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739515,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungjun Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5941037/5739515/5739515-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyungjun Lim received the B.S. degree from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Han Yang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2008.

By generating a mask map of the overshoot regions, we combine a ripple-reduced image and an overshoot-reduced image according to the mask map in the image domain to obtain a ringing-artifact reduced image.

This novel feature achieves significant coding gain over coding a macroblock using the fixed block size. However, ME is computationally intensive with the complexity increasing linearly with the number of the allowed block sizes. This paper presents an architecture for a combined fast ME algorithm with the predict hexagon search (PHS) and the edge information mode decision (EIMD). The EIMD algorithm utilizes edge information to predict the best block size quickly and precisely. The PHS algorithm searches the best motion vector efficiently. The analytical results reveal that the EIMD+PHS algorithm is 2.4-25 times faster than other popular fast ME algorithms. Additionally, the EIMD+PHS algorithm is 600-2000 times faster than JM10.2, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio degradation is less than 0.15 dB. The proposed architecture applies a large search range and low operation frequency as compared with other popular ME architectures.

We present a leading local algorithm and then accelerate it by parallel computing. High matching accuracy is achieved by cost aggregation over shape-adaptive support regions and disparity refinement using reliable initial estimates. A novel sample-and-restore scheme is proposed to make the algorithm scalable, capable of attaining several times speedup at the expense of minor accuracy degradation. The refinement and the restoration are jointly realized by a local voting method. To accelerate the voting on CUDA, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-oriented bitwise fast voting method is proposed, faster than the traditional histogram-based approach with two orders of magnitude. The whole algorithm is parallelized on CUDA at a fine granularity, efficiently exploiting the computing resources of GPUs. Our design is among the fastest stereo matching methods on GPUs. Evaluated in the Middlebury stereo benchmark, the proposed design produces the most accurate results among the real-time methods. The advantages of speed, accuracy, and desirable scalability advocate our design for practical applications such as robotics systems and multiview teleconferencing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time and Accurate Stereo: A Scalable Approach With Bitwise Fast Voting on CUDA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2133150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5941037/05739521.pdf","startPage":"867","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2133150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5941037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time and Accurate Stereo: A Scalable Approach With Bitwise Fast Voting on CUDA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5739521/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141661","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time and Accurate Stereo: A Scalable Approach With Bitwise Fast Voting on CUDA","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhang-2133150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08107S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5941037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5941037","articleId":"5739521","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739524,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The proposed system consists of a reader coil inductively coupled to the sensor circuit, an analog frontend circuit, and a digital signal processing unit. The analog frontend circuit generates a dc voltage representing the sensor resonance curve. The frequency of the reader coil driving signal is continuously readjusted by the digital signal processing unit. Based on analytical calculation and system simulation, we derive a model for the achievable accuracy of the overall sensor and readout system. The accuracy is limited by noise and systematic errors due to the measurement principle. We show how to design the digital signal processing system for optimal insensitivity to voltage noise. The noise sensitivity of the measurement system is inversely proportional to the square of the quality factor of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LC</i>\n sensor. This means that minimizing the losses of the sensor is of crucial importance to obtain a wireless measurement system with a high range and a good insensitivity to noise. Subsequently, we outline an approach to calculate the sensor resonance frequency, quality factor, and inductive coupling factor from the available voltage signals in the signal processing unit using linear fitting functions. The accuracy of our approach is exemplified by a system simulation for typical sensor parameters. For the system studied, we show that the relative linearization error of the sensor resonance frequency measurement is below 0.02%. Taking the general models presented for both the noise sensitivity and linearization error into account, it is possible to estimate the maximum distance and accuracy for any wireless sensor system based on an inductively coupled \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LC</i>\n resonator.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5948426/05739528.pdf","startPage":"2976","endPage":"2983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2122110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2122110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5948426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wireless Sensor Readout System\u2014Circuit Concept, Simulation, and Accuracy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Resonant frequency","Noise","Frequency measurement","Frequency modulation","Couplings","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue processing circuits","circuit noise","circuit resonance","circuit simulation","coils","digital signal processing chips","frequency measurement","inductive sensors","linearisation techniques","measurement systems","passive networks","Q-factor","radiotelemetry","readout electronics","sensitivity","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor readout circuit","circuit simulation","readout electronics","wireless passive sensor","inductively coupled LC resonant circuit","reader coil","sensor circuit","analog frontend circuit","digital signal processing unit","dc voltage generation","sensor resonance curve","voltage noise sensitivity","quality factor","wireless measurement system","linear fitting function","linearization error","sensor resonance frequency measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitance transducers","inductive coupling"," $LC$ circuits","remote sensing","resonance detection","telemetry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Wireless Sensor Readout System\u2014Circuit Concept, Simulation, and Accuracy","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5739528/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12096321","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wireless Sensor Readout System\u2014Circuit Concept, Simulation, and Accuracy","sourcePdf":"tim-nopper-2122110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082252S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5948426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5948426","articleId":"5739528","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5739529,"authors":[{"name":"Niranjan D.

The complex resilient propagation algorithm (C-RPROP) with error-dependent weight backtracking step accelerates the training speed significantly and provides better approximation accuracy.

On trees, we prove that the algorithm is optimal for two robots. For k robots, the algorithm has an optimal dependence on the size of the tree but not on its radius.

The model underlying undirected-graph exploration is a set of rooms connected by opaque passages; thus, the algorithm is appropriate for scenarios like indoor navigation or cave exploration. In this framework, communication can be realized by bookkeeping devices being dropped by the robots at explored vertices, the states of which are read and changed by further visiting robots. Simulations have been performed in both tree and graph explorations to corroborate the mathematical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirobot Tree and Graph Exploration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2121170","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5975532/05739538.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2121170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739538/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Multirobot Tree and Graph Exploration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5739538/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205413","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirobot Tree and Graph Exploration","sourcePdf":"tro-xiao-2121170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090169S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5975532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5975532","articleId":"5739538","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739539,"authors":[{"name":"Di Huang","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInfoRmatique en Image et Syst\u00e8mes d'information, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique 5205, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5976948/5739539/5739539-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Di Huang (S\u201910) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

This problem can be formulated as a minimax optimization problem and can be transformed into a linear semi-definite programming problem. Interior point algorithm can then be applied after discretization. However, if the dimension of the problem is high, the number of discrete points of the specified region and consequently the dimension of the resultant constraint matrix is high. This high dimension provides a difficulty when directly employing interior point algorithm. Since it results in a large size problem, this problem is considered in this paper. To reduce the computational complexity and memory usage, a two-stage method has been proposed. In the first stage, by using an infinite length filter formulation, an infinite length limit for the original problem is obtained. Then, based on that limit, a reduced problem with a finite filter length is found. The computational complexity of this method is derived. It provides a significant reduction compared to a direct solution of the original problem. It is shown that as the filter length increases, the approximative problem comes close to the optimal infinite solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate with examples the close correspondence between proposed design and optimal design. Also the superiority of the suggested method is illustrated in a three-dimensional beamformer design, where the direct method can only design broadband beamformer of very short filter lengths.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2133490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5948440","startPage":"3647","endPage":"3656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5948440/05739541.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Stage Method for the Design of Near-Field Broadband Beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739541/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Method for the Design of Near-Field Broadband Beamformer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12157721","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Method for the Design of Near-Field Broadband Beamformer","sourcePdf":"tsp-yiu-2133490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073075S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5948440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5948440","articleId":"5739541","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5739542,"authors":[{"name":"Lutfa Akter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5765536/5739542/5739542-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lutfa Akter (M'04) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Kansas State University, Manhattan, in 2010.","Since 2002, she has been with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, where she was a Lecturer and is currently an Assistant Professor.

Our measures for QoS include bit error rate (BER) and minimum rate requirement. We design a QoS-constrained bi-objective optimization problem with the objective of minimizing transmit power and maximizing rate. Unlike prior efforts, we transform the BER constraint into a convex constraint to guarantee optimality of the resulting solution. Our interest in this paper is to develop a user-based distributed approach to solve the optimization problem and compare the solution with the centralized approach. We employ dual decomposition theory to derive three different formulations of the distributed problem.

Since data rates cannot be improved by merely increasing transmission power in the presence of ICI, the interference management and alignment become crucial for cell-edge users. However, when channel state information (CSI) is not available at BSs, it is difficult to apply interference alignment techniques. In this paper, we consider a simple approach where each BS in coordination transmits signals to a dedicated user through multiple subcarriers shared by adjacent BSs, which results in an interference channel, so that higher diversity can be exploited for better performance. Using joint detection at users, we show that a reasonable performance can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5765536/05739543.pdf","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2132767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2132767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Sharing and Joint Detection for Cell-Edge Users in Downlink Multicell OFDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Complexity theory","MIMO","Bit error rate","Joints","Diversity methods","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel sharing","joint detection","cell edge user","downlink multicell OFDMA system","cellular system","intercell interference","ICI","interference management","channel state information","interference alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordination","intercell interference (ICI)","joint detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Sharing and Joint Detection for Cell-Edge Users in Downlink Multicell OFDMA Systems","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5739543/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11976277","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Sharing and Joint Detection for Cell-Edge Users in Downlink Multicell OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-choi-2132767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063853S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5765536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5765536","articleId":"5739543","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739544,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Abdel Khalek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA","American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Abdel Khalek","id":"38262734400"},{"name":"Lina Al-Kanj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Al-Kanj","id":"37396775600"},{"name":"Zaher Dawy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Zaher","lastName":"Dawy","id":"37268830800"},{"name":"George Turkiyyah","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Turkiyyah","id":"37355217700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5739544","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":900},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Optimization","Planning","Quality of service","Interference","Base stations","Radio network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","optimisation","power control","quality of service","search problems","telecommunication control","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint uplink-downlink UMTS radio network planning","universal mobile telecommunication system networks","SIR-based power control","quality-of-service","QoS requirements","continuous-based site placement","integer-based site selection","base stations","signal-to-interference ratio","pattern search techniques","derivative-free optimization","augmented Lagrange multiplier","site-selection problem","network coverage","location constraints","electromagnetic radiation constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular network planning","electromagnetic (EM) radiation exposure","network deployment","network optimization"]}],"abstract":"Universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) networks should be deployed according to cost-effective strategies that optimize a cost objective and satisfy target quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for joint uplink/downlink UMTS radio planning with the objective of minimizing total power consumption in the network. Specifically, we define two components of the radio planning problem: 1) continuous-based site placement and 2) integer-based site selection. In the site-placement problem, our goal is to find the optimal locations of UMTS base stations (BSs) in a certain geographic area with a given user distribution to minimize the total power expenditure such that a satisfactory level of downlink and uplink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is maintained with bounded outage constraints. We model the problem as a constrained optimization problem with SIR-based uplink and downlink power control scheme. An algorithm is proposed and implemented using pattern search techniques for derivative-free optimization with augmented Lagrange multiplier estimates to support general constraints. In the site-selection problem, we aim to select the minimum set of BSs from a fixed set of candidate sites that satisfies quality and outage constraints. We develop an efficient elimination algorithm by proposing a method for classifying BSs that are critical for network coverage and QoS. Finally, the problem is reformulated to take care of location constraints whereby the placement of BSs in a subset of the deployment area is not permitted due to, e.g., private property limitations or electromagnetic radiation constraints. Experimental results and optimal tradeoff curves are presented and analyzed for various scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization Models and Algorithms for Joint Uplink/Downlink UMTS Radio Network Planning With SIR-Based Power Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2132745","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5765536/05739544.pdf","startPage":"1612","endPage":"1625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2132745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization Models and Algorithms for Joint Uplink/Downlink UMTS Radio Network Planning With SIR-Based Power Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11976278","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization Models and Algorithms for Joint Uplink/Downlink UMTS Radio Network Planning With SIR-Based Power Control","sourcePdf":"tvt-dawy-2132745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071298S","chronDate":"May  2011","isNumber":"5765536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","articleId":"5739544","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739545,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwen He","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Electric Vehicles, School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5765536/5739545/5739545-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongwen He received the M.E. degree in vehicle engineering from the Jilin University of Technology, Changchun, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in vehicle engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2003.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the National Engineering Laboratory for Electric Vehicles, School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology.

Generally, the Kalman filter algorithm is selected to dynamically estimate the SOC. However, it easily causes divergence due to the uncertainty of the battery model and system noise. To obtain a better convergent and robust result, an adaptive Kalman filter algorithm that can greatly improve the dependence of the traditional filter algorithm on the battery model is employed. In this paper, the typical characteristics of the lithium-ion battery are analyzed by experiment, such as hysteresis, polarization, Coulomb efficiency, etc. In addition, an improved Thevenin battery model is achieved by adding an extra \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RC</i>\n branch to the Thevenin model, and model parameters are identified by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm. Further, an adaptive EKF (AEKF) algorithm is adopted to the SOC estimation of the lithium-ion battery. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with federal urban driving schedules. The proposed SOC estimation using AEKF is more accurate and reliable than that using EKF.

The weights of the 1D detector are updated to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of the detection output by setting the weights of the 2D detector at the values determined in the previous iteration, and vice versa. Performance analyses of the bit-error-rate (BER) bound, the convergence, and the required computational complexity are conducted to assess the feasibility of the proposed MUDs.

Toward that end, the deployment of fixed relays by the operators has become an accepted network architecture for which orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is the envisioned air interface, and efficient resource utilization is imperative. In contrast to the current literature, this paper presents a novel throughput-optimal formulation, which performs joint intracell routing and scheduling, in accordance with the emerging OFDMA-based cellular relay networks employing two-hop half-duplex relaying. Low-complexity iterative algorithms are devised to solve the formulated optimization over two consecutive subframes (the base station transmits, followed by the relay stations) using queue-length coupling. We first show that the network capacity, below which the policy is throughput optimal, has been significantly increased, compared with the previously proposed quasi-full-duplex relaying (FDR) scheme, at a slight complexity increase. Hence, throughput fairness and ubiquity have been improved at high traffic loads, aside from the substantial improvement in both queue-awareness and latency. Second, we show that, without empirical priority weights, our efficient implementation of throughput-optimal scheduling achieves a ubiquitous and fair service within each class of users (with symmetric traffic) and across classes of asymmetric traffic in a relative sense on different time scales. Load balancing among only the active relays could still be jointly realized with the resource allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5876034/05739548.pdf","startPage":"2280","endPage":"2292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2132746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2132746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Resource Allocation Toward Ubiquitous Coverage in OFDMA-Based Cellular Relay Networks With Asymmetric Traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Routing","Resource management","Joints","Optimal scheduling","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fair resource allocation","ubiquitous coverage","OFDMA-based cellular relay networks","asymmetric traffic","next-generation wireless networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","fixed relays","network architecture","resource utilization","air interface","throughput-optimal formulation","joint intracell routing","two-hop half-duplex relaying","low-complexity iterative algorithms","base station","relay station","queue-length coupling","optimization","quasi-full-duplex relaying scheme","throughput-optimal scheduling","ubiquitous service","fair service","load balancing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular","fairness","intracell routing","load balancing","orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA)","radio resource management (RRM)","relaying","throughput","ubiquity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fair Resource Allocation Toward Ubiquitous Coverage in OFDMA-Based Cellular Relay Networks With Asymmetric Traffic","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5739548/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2011","accessionNumber":"12060206","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Resource Allocation Toward Ubiquitous Coverage in OFDMA-Based Cellular Relay Networks With Asymmetric Traffic","sourcePdf":"tvt-salem-2132746-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10184S","chronDate":"Jun  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5876034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5876034","articleId":"5739548","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739550,"authors":[{"name":"Hooman Darabi","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5772983/5739550/5739550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hooman Darabi (S'98\u2013M'99\u2013SM'05) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1972.

We describe performance characteristics of such models, including noise, dynamic range, and frequency resolution. We show that the addition of phase information improves frequency estimation as compared to the use of amplitude information alone. In particular, the use of both amplitude and phase information in a novel nonlinear bio-inspired center-surround coincidence-detection stage simultaneously improves frequency estimation and implements a lowpass-to-bandpass transformation on cochlear outputs. In order to further improve frequency estimation we propose a novel wireless receiver architecture that is a broadband generalization of narrowband heterodyning systems commonly used in radio. We term this architecture cochlear heterodyning. It exploits the efficiency of cochlear spectrum analysis to perform parallel, multi-scale analysis of wideband signals and can be constructed with cochlea-like traveling-wave structures. When combined with our prior work on an RF cochlea, such architectures may be useful in cognitive radios for creating RF foveas that select narrowband components present within wideband, but spectrally sparse signals. The operation of RF foveas is analogous to how the eye foveates on narrow but interesting portions of an image. Analogies between spectrum analysis and the process of successive-subranging analog-to-digital conversion illustrate how successively finer frequency resolution is achieved in an RF fovea. Finally, we show that RF foveas can be used in feedback loops to perform interference cancellation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Cochlear Heterodyning Architecture for an RF Fovea","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2123710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5934463/05739559.pdf","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2123710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Cochlear Heterodyning Architecture for an RF Fovea","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5739559/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12084169","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Cochlear Heterodyning Architecture for an RF Fovea","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mandal-2123710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184707S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5934463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5934463","articleId":"5739559","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739560,"authors":[{"name":"Dami\u00e1n Edgardo Marelli","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6029391/5739560/5739560-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dami\u00e1n Edgardo Marelli received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from the Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina, in 1995, the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, and a Bachelor (Honous) degree in mathematics from the University of Newcastle, Australia, in 2003.","In 2004 and 2005, he held a postdoctoral research fellowship at the Laboratoire d'Analyse Topologie et Probabilit\u00e9s, CNRS/Universit\u00e9 de Provence, France.

This paper proposes a blind estimation method for the analog filterbank parameters, which is able to cope with nonstationary input signals. This is achieved by using the notion of averaged input spectrum. The estimated parameters are used to reconstruct the samples in a least mean squares (LMS) sense. The proposed LMS design generalizes existing approaches by dropping the bandlimited assumption on the input signal. Instead, it assumes that the input has an arbitrary power spectrum which is adaptively estimated. Numerical experiments are presented showing the good performance of the blind estimation stage and the clear advantage of the proposed LMS design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","volume":"58","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12261845","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739560/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Filterbank ADCs With Blind Filterbank Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Filterbank ADCs With Blind Filterbank Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-marelli-2123750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094461S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6029391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6029391","articleId":"5739560","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5739561,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Pan-American, Edinburg, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6179396/5739561/5739561-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenjie Dong (M'07) received the M.S. degree in automatic control from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Riverside, in 2009.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, the University of Texas\u2014Pan American, Edinburg.

It is well documented that, as the order of a nonlinear system increases, analytic calculation of these derivatives becomes prohibitive. Therefore, in practice, either alternative control approaches are used or the derivatives are neglected in the implementation. Neglecting the derivatives results in the loss of all guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods for the adaptive backstepping approach and may result in instability. This paper presents a new implementation approach for adaptive backstepping control. The main objectives are to facilitate the derivation and implementation of the adaptive backstepping approach, with performance guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods, for applications that were prohibitively difficult using the standard analytic implementation approach. The new approach uses filtering methods to produce certain command signals and their derivatives which eliminates the requirement of analytic differentiation. The approach also introduces filters to generate certain compensating signals necessary to compute compensated tracking errors suitable for adaptive parameter estimation. We present a set of Lemmas and Theorems to analyze the performance both during the initialization and the operating phases. We show that the initialization phase is of finite duration that can be controlled by selection of a design parameter. We also show that all signals within the system are bounded during this short initialization phase. During the operating phase, we show that the command filtered implementation approach has theoretical properties identical to those of the conventional approach. The general approach is presented and analyzed for systems in generalized parameter strict feedback form. Extensions of the approach are presented to demonstrate the application of the method to a land vehicle trajectory following application. Application and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2121907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6179396/05739561.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2121907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Command Filtered Adaptive Backstepping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739561/","displayDocTitle":"Command Filtered Adaptive Backstepping","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12653851","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739561/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Command Filtered Adaptive Backstepping","sourcePdf":"tcst-dong-2121907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148074S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6179396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"347","xplore-issue":"6179396","articleId":"5739561","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5739562,"authors":[{"name":"Yudong Ma","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yudong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37400254000"},{"name":"Francesco Borrelli","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Borrelli","id":"37299856800"},{"name":"Brandon Hencey","affiliation":["Sibley School of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Cornell University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Hencey","id":"37399263800"},{"name":"Brian Coffey","affiliation":["Department of Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Coffey","id":"37545936400"},{"name":"Sorin Bengea","affiliation":["United Technologies Research Center, Inc., East Hartford, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Sorin","lastName":"Bengea","id":"37424587700"},{"name":"Philip Haves","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Haves","id":"37545934800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5739562","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":272,"citationCountPatent":29,"totalDownloads":6042},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Cooling","Storage tanks","Buildings","Atmospheric modeling","Temperature measurement","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","building management systems","cooling","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive control","building cooling systems","model-based predictive control","thermal energy storage","water tank","cold water","cooling towers","thermal storage tanks","chilling system operation","periodic robust invariant set","terminal constraints","moving window blocking strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Building energy","building modeling","model predictive control (MPC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739562","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2011.2124461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","abstract":"This brief presents a model-based predictive control (MPC) approach to building cooling systems with thermal energy storage. We focus on buildings equipped with a water tank used for actively storing cold water produced by a series of chillers. First, simplified models of chillers, cooling towers, thermal storage tanks, and buildings are developed and validated for the purpose of model-based control design. Then an MPC for the chilling system operation is proposed to optimally store the thermal energy in the tank by using predictive knowledge of building loads and weather conditions. This brief addresses real-time implementation and feasibility issues of the MPC scheme by using a simplified hybrid model of the system, a periodic robust invariant set as terminal constraints, and a moving window blocking strategy. The controller is experimentally validated at the University of California, Merced. The experiments show a reduction in the central plant electricity cost and an improvement of its efficiency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2011.2124461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179396","startPage":"796","endPage":"803","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6179396/05739562.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control for the Operation of Building Cooling Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739562/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control for the Operation of Building Cooling Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12653852","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control for the Operation of Building Cooling Systems","sourcePdf":"tcst-ma-2124461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065341S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6179396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"6179396","articleId":"5739562","onlineDate":"28 March 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5739566,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Papavasiliou","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6048014/5739566/5739566-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anthony Papavasiliou (S'09) is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of California at Berkeley.

On the basis of the Cloud Security Alliance's work, a cloud is modeled in seven layers: facility, network, hardware, OS, middle ware, application, and the user. These layers can be controlled by either the cloud provider or the cloud customer. The paper present a set of recommended restrictions and audits to facilitate cloud security. Although the recommendations might be overkill for deployments involving no sensitive data, they might be insufficient to allow certain information to be hosted in any public or community cloud.

Such conditions are becoming commonplace with the influx of smart systems, wireless networks, remote sensing, and autonomous vehicles/systems. The virtual sensor data is created autonomously in real time from the original data using a novel two-dimensional (2-D) Autoregressive Vector Prediction algorithm. A 2-D transform is then applied to the new virtual data set, which includes the original data, to give a robust high resolution imaging capability. Simulations are used to compare this super-resolution capability with a high-resolution technique and the truth, to resolve previously obscured low-level signals in the presence of a dominant source. The virtual sensor data is also compared to the truth data. We also summarize the computational cost and extrapolation stability to achieve this high-resolution capability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2011.5739773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739764","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733273/5739764/05739773.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution imaging using virtual sensors from 2-D autoregressive vector extrapolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739773/","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution imaging using virtual sensors from 2-D autoregressive vector extrapolation","conferenceDate":"22-24 Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11888089","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution imaging using virtual sensors from 2-D autoregressive vector extrapolation","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1569371661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117033S","chronDate":"22-24 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733273","isNumber":"5739764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733273","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5739764","articleId":"5739773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5739779,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwoo Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yongwoo","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37856439300"},{"name":"Albert H.

It is shown that while the fill factor and power consumption of the design is close to the previous structures, it is able to operate at lower modulated illumination levels and higher dynamic range of background intensities.","doi":"10.1109/SAS.2011.5739820","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5733273/5739764/05739820.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS.2011.5739820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739764","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high sensitivity correlation image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5739820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high sensitivity correlation image sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Feb. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739820/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Feb. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11888134","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5739820/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high sensitivity correlation image sensor","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1569377719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061846S","chronDate":"22-24 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5733273","isNumber":"5739764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5733273","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5739764","articleId":"5739820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5739839,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Eun Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Seung Eun Lee is an assistant professor in the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering at Seoul National University of Science and Technol-ogy.

Most processes in industry are characterized by nonlinear and time-varying behavior. In this context, the identification of mathematical models for nonlinear systems is vital in many fields of engineering. The Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) is a powerful approach for nonlinear identification and can be improved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approaches. This paper presents a multivariable nonlinear system identification using RBF-NN combined with standard PSO and Constriction Factor PSO (CFPSO) approaches in order to determine the RBF-NN parameters. RBF-NN is considered to be a good choice for black-box modeling problems due to its rapid learning capacity and, therefore, has been applied successfully to nonlinear time series modeling and nonlinear identification. On the other hand, PSO was inspired by the choreography of bird flocks and fish schools and can be seen as a distributed behavior algorithm that performs multidimensional search. Furthermore, promising simulation results from performance analysis of the proposed RBF-NN with PSO training approaches are presented and discussed in this paper showing promising results.","doi":"10.1109/INDUSCON.2010.5739862","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 9th IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industry Applications - INDUSCON 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDUSCON.2010.5739862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739850","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 9th IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industry Applications - INDUSCON 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738180/5739850/05739862.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable nonlinear boiler power plant identification through neural networks and Particle Swarm Optimization approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739862/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multivariable nonlinear boiler power plant identification through neural networks and Particle Swarm Optimization approaches","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739862/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11904327","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","conferenceDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable nonlinear boiler power plant identification through neural networks and Particle Swarm Optimization approaches","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"apc1cI0131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099245S","chronDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5738180","isNumber":"5739850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738180","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5739850","articleId":"5739862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5739882,"authors":[{"name":"Maykel B.

This new control approach differs from the traditional fieldbus systems in that the controller and the plant are physically separated and connected through an industrial network. The major challenge of NCS design is the limited data feedback using the communication network (network delays and packet loss), which can degrade the NCS performance or even cause instability. For CAN-based NCS, another important issue is the correct selection of the messages sampling times. In order to mitigate these problems, control methodologies have been developed based on different types of network protocols in conjunction with different strategies to handle the degenerative effects related to NCS. This paper describes our approach to design and evaluate a new control methodology for application in CAN-based NCS. The solution is based on an adaptive PID controller that automatically manages the NCS sampling time, reducing the network utilization rate while maintaining NCS performance and stability. The feasibility and effectiveness of the control methodology are outlined through experimentation on a CAN-based NCS platform, showing significant results in the CAN network utilization reduction.","doi":"10.1109/INDUSCON.2010.5739894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDUSCON.2010.5739894","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 9th IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industry Applications - INDUSCON 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5738180/5739850/05739894.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 9th IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industry Applications - INDUSCON 2010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling time adaptive control methodology for CAN-based Networked Control Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Sampling time adaptive control methodology for CAN-based Networked Control Systems","conferenceDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5739894/","accessionNumber":"11904352","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5739894/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling time adaptive control methodology for CAN-based Networked Control Systems","confLoc":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","sourcePdf":"apc6eI0014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04856S","chronDate":"8-10 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5738180","isNumber":"5739850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5738180","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5739850","articleId":"5739894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5739951,"authors":[{"name":"Giovani G.
