In this work, we extend our previous Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementation of MR image reconstruction with compensation for susceptibility-induced field inhomogeneity effects by incorporating an additional quadratic regularization term. Regularization techniques commonly impose the prior information that MR images are relatively smooth by penalizing large changes in intensity between neighboring voxels. However, the associated computations often increase data access and the overall computational load, which can lead to slower image reconstruction. This motivates us to adopt a GPU-enabled implementation of spatial regularization using sparse matrices. This implementation enables the computations for the entire reconstruction procedure to be done on the GPU, which avoids the memory bandwidth bottlenecks associated with frequent communications between the GPU and CPU. Both the CPU and GPU code of this implementation will be available for release at the time of the conference.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5640008","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639231/05640008.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5640008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639231","startPage":"578","endPage":"582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse regularization in MRI iterative reconstruction using GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse regularization in MRI iterative reconstruction using GPUs","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640008/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662683","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5640008/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse regularization in MRI iterative reconstruction using GPUs","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104965S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5639231","articleId":"5640008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5640039,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Yao","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Yao","id":"37595251100"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Gu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Gu","id":"37535057900"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Biomedical Informatics and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406752100"},{"name":"Jinyong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Biomedical Informatics and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jinyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407611100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5640039","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Endoscopes","Batteries","Rectifiers","Wireless communication","Voltage control","Regulators","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","biomedical electronics","CMOS integrated circuits","controllers","endoscopes","energy management systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless power management","system-on-chip","SOC","active capsule endoscope","low-dropout regulator","rapid battery charger management","conversion efficiency","voltage 4.4 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Management","Rectifier","LDO","Battery Charge"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of wireless power management SOC for active capsule endoscope","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2010.5640039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639233","endPage":"1749","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5624551/5639233/05640039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2010.5640039","startPage":"1746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640039","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel wireless power supply solution, and designs a power management system-on-chip (SOC) for active capsule endoscope.

The self-resonant coil inside the human body is used to receive energy, and the energy is rectified and regulated to generate a stable voltage for charging a button battery, which provides stable power for controlling and driving the system by the low dropout (LDO2) regulator fixed in the capsule endoscope. The power management SOC was designed using a 0.18-um CMOS high voltage process. Simulation results indicate that the rectifier has high conversion efficiency of voltage and power under 12mA load. The LDO1 output can keep at 4.4V in spite of the variations of input voltage and loading current. The preliminary system simulation indicates the SOC achieves control of battery charging-recharging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11662799","htmlLink":"/document/5640039/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of wireless power management SOC for active capsule endoscope","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of wireless power management SOC for active capsule endoscope","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053791S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5624551","isNumber":"5639233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5624551","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5639233","articleId":"5640039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5640073,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37598961200"},{"name":"Hang Yu","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37593342100"},{"name":"Lai Jiang","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lai","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37287951500"},{"name":"Lixiao Ma","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lixiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37597182400"},{"name":"Zhen Ji","affiliation":["Shenzhen City Key Laboratory of Embedded System Design College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Ji","id":"37291525900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5640073","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Lifting Scheme for ECG QRS complexes detection and its FPGA implementation","abstract":"For ECG QRS complexes detection, an Adaptive Lifting Scheme (ALS) has been developed and successfully implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

The cost of ASICs is rising exponentially in deep submicron and hence it is important to investigate ways of reducing FPGA power consumption so that they can also be employed in place of ASICs in portable energy constrained applications. It is also important to investigate the possibility of extending the use of FPGA even in subthreshold region for ultra low power applications. At the same frequency, subthreshold circuits show orders of magnitude power saving over super-threshold circuits for low throughput applications. This paper explores the subthreshold performance of a basic FPGA building block-a Look up Table (LUT). It presents comparative analysis of different topologies of three input LUT in deep submicron (DSM) for delay, power dissipation and switching energy. The proposed cross-coupled PMOS (CCP) encoded LUT shows 36% improvement in delay and 31% in switching energy at the cost of 4% increase in static power dissipation over conventional one. However, the increase in static power consumption is negligible compared to the improvement in switching energy. Thereafter, this paper investigates the potential of carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNFET) based LUT in the subthreshold region.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance optimization of LUT of subthreshold FPGA in deep submicron","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640383","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640383.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreNote":"As originally published there was an error in this document.

Optimal packet sizes under different node densities are evaluated to make the system energy efficient. The effects of correlation and power control error (pce) on packet size optimization are studied. Energy requirements and delay for successful transmission of file at sink in a single hop with infinite ARQ per packet is investigated for optimal packet based and other different lengths of packet based schemes.

A primary receiver (PRx) is also assumed to be present in our network model. We assume a network where primary radio network (PRN) and cognitive radio network (CRN) coexist. The new algorithm for admission control of cognitive radio (CR) users considers two constraints. BS computes instantaneous SIR of a SU and PRx computes interference from all SUs present in the network. Specifically, the proposed CAC algorithm considers uplink Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) of a SU to be above an SIR threshold level and instantaneous interference at primary receiver to be below a predefined interference threshold. Performance of the algorithm has been evaluated in different scenarios in terms of blocking probability of SU in presence of a PRx.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11661822","htmlLink":"/document/5640405/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for admission control of secondary users in CDMA based Cognitive Radio Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for admission control of secondary users in CDMA based Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"16153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054585S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5640422,"authors":[{"name":"Sunita V.

Hence confidentiality of patient's data can be achieved by hiding Electronic Patient's Report (EPR) data in corresponding medical images. However, medical images require extreme care when embedding additional data within them because the additional information must not affect the image quality and readability. This paper proposes high capacity; robust blind lossless reversible data hiding technique along with Region of Interest (ROI) tamper detection. A new coding technique called Class Dependent Coding Scheme (CDCS) is used to increase the embedding capacity. The original image is recovered without any distortion from the marked medical image following the extraction of the hidden data. As the statistical quantity related to the correlation among the pixel values is used for embedding the data, the system becomes robust to JPEG compression to certain extent. The embedding scheme also takes care of sensitive part of the medical image responsible for accurate diagnosis called ROL For detecting any tamper in ROI region, a secure hash function is calculated on ROI region and embedded in Region of Non-Interest (RONI) along with EPR data bits. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme exhibits high imperceptibility as well as low perceptual variations in stego images. Even a slight modification in ROI gets detected at receiver side. Imperceptibility and robustness have been tested against various image manipulation attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5640422/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661855","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High capacity, robust lossless EPR data hiding using CDCS with ROI tamper detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High capacity, robust lossless EPR data hiding using CDCS with ROI tamper detection","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"25333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046815S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":5640423,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Dhar Roy","affiliation":["ECE Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Dhar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400812100"},{"name":"Priyobrata Parida","affiliation":["ECE Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Priyobrata","lastName":"Parida","id":"37588820900"},{"name":"Sumit Kundu","affiliation":["ECE Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37401883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9034-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9033-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9032-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5640423","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Iterative decoding","Power control","Multiaccess communication","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cellular radio","code division multiple access","data communication","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward link performance","packet data","LDPC","cellular CDMA","data services","low density parity check","LDPC codes","packet error rate","ARQ","uncoded data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward link","LDPC","ARQ","Throughput","Soft handoff"]}],"abstract":"Forward link performance of data services has been evaluated in cellular CDMA network by incorporating low density parity check (LDPC) codes in presence of soft handoff.

The proposed system identifies speakers by their acoustic characteristics embedded in speech signal of speakers. Features are obtained from approximation and detail coefficients by calculating entropy, standard deviation and mean at each decomposition level. The similarity between the extracted features and a set of reference features is calculated by means of K-NN classifier to determine the speaker's identity. The results are evaluated with VoxForge speech corpus containing more than 200 speakers and each speaker profile contains ten speech signals. The results achieved are promising with 83.9 % accuracy for 200 speakers. Some popular existing methods are also evaluated for comparison in this paper. The result shows that the proposed method is more effective and robust than other methods. The performance of our system is very good with noisy dataset at different SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Text independent speaker identification using wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640426","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640426.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Text independent speaker identification using wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640426/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661859","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Text independent speaker identification using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"29380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045428S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5640428,"authors":[{"name":"Bhupinder Verma","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Lovely Professional University Phagwara, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Bhupinder","lastName":"Verma","id":"37590078400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9034-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9033-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9032-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5640428","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1008},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640428","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Artificial neural networks","Classification algorithms","Feature extraction","Head","Image analysis","Magnetic heads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area measurement","computer vision","crops","length measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing technique","rice grading","rice classification","computer vision system","rice kernel sorting","Indian rice","Markfed supreme rice","Markfed golden rice","Hafed Basmati rice","area measurement","perimeter measurement","maximum length measurement","maximum width measurement","compactness measurement","elongation measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image anafysis","Binarization Morphological operations","Computer/Machine vision","Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"A relatively faster computer vision system has been discussed to analyze and sort rice kernels.

This paper presents separable 2-D discrete Hartley transform (SDHT) and its Distributed Arithmetic (DA) based hardware architecture as an alternate to DCT in transform based coding of image compression. The proposed DA architecture for 1-D DHT has very less computations as compared to existing 1-D DCT. The proposed DHT architecture implemented in FPGA indicates a significant hardware savings as compared to FPGA resources used in an efficient memory based DA approach. The additional advantage of SDHT is that its inverse transform is same as forward transform with a constant division. This is demonstrated through a Xilinx FPGA XC2VP30 device.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640432","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640432.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D Separable discrete Hartley transform architecture for efficient FPGA resource","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640432/","displayDocTitle":"2-D Separable discrete Hartley transform architecture for efficient FPGA resource","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640432/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661871","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D Separable discrete Hartley transform architecture for efficient FPGA resource","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"314448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09646S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5640451,"authors":[{"name":"Prakash Kumar Rout","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Prakash Kumar","lastName":"Rout","id":"38102554300"},{"name":"D.

The reconfigurability of FPGA has made this mode of digital circuit synthesis more popular among the system designers. But unlike other ICs it provides a restricted hardware structure for circuit implementation and hence the computer aided design (CAD) software is also constrained. The placement being a very vital step in the design process needs to be performed optimally for high performance circuits. In this work novel techniques for placement based on simple particle swarm optimization (PSO), constricted PSO and time varying inertia weight (TVIW) PSO are proposed taking bounding box cost into consideration. The results of simulation reveal a competitive performance of the circuits implemented. The technique proposed here also offer faster convergence to a placement solution. The performance of a single BCD counter circuit is studied in details by using the different PSO algorithms. The netlist generated from the Xilinx design tool is used for placement and optimization results are reported here.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640451.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel PSO based FPGA placement techniques","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel PSO based FPGA placement techniques","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661949","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5640451/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel PSO based FPGA placement techniques","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"94513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077971S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5640452,"authors":[{"name":"Shibaji Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, Institute of Engineering & Management, Y-12, Sector-V, Salt lake Electronics Complex, Kolkata-700 091"],"firstName":"Shibaji","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37594296000"},{"name":"Uddipan Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, Institute of Engineering & Management, Y-12, Sector-V, Salt lake Electronics Complex, Kolkata-700 091"],"firstName":"Uddipan","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37591226800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9034-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9033-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9032-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5640452","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640452","abstract":"The design of a micro-strip patch antenna is proposed by optimizing its resonant frequency, Bandwidth of operation and Radiation resistance using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

PCIe 2.1 or Gen2 is the latest standard for expansion cards that has come recently on mainstream personal computers. The designer can implement PCIe inside an FPGA by either developing the complete PCIe protocol or by purchasing a readily available IP from the market. Different solutions for the implementation of PCIe design using FPGAs are available through couple of vendors, including Xilinx and Altera. Xilinx has Soft IP as well as Hard IP available to the designer to get started with the design. In this paper we present our implementation of PCIe Geni design in various Xilinx families of devices and further show the migration of PCIe Geni design to Gen2 design using state of the art FPGA's. We also highlight our interfacing logic design consideration for the Geni and Gen2 IP blocks and some of the critical aspects that needs to be addressed while designing the board.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640458","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640458.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Migrating FPGA based PCI Express Geni design to Gen2","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640458/","displayDocTitle":"Migrating FPGA based PCI Express Geni design to Gen2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661959","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640458/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Migrating FPGA based PCI Express Geni design to Gen2","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"91472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04558S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5640477,"authors":[{"name":"Kapila","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar, India"],"lastName":"Kapila","id":"37591166000"},{"name":"Saroj","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar, India"],"lastName":"Saroj","id":"37591162600"},{"name":"Dinesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085385440"},{"name":"Kanika","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar, India"],"lastName":"Kanika","id":"37591161200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9034-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9033-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9032-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5640477","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Data mining","Gallium","Genetics","Filtering algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","entropy","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","entropy","automated rule mining","data mining","filtering bias","feature selection","initial population","large datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature Selection","Genetic Algorithm","Entropy","Rule Mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640477","abstract":"The main criticism of employing genetic algorithms in data mining applications is local convergence and their long running time particularly for large datasets with large number of attributes. One solution to this problem is giving a filtering bias to initial population such that more relevant attributes get initialized with higher probability as compared to not so important attributes with respect to prediction. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm with entropy based filtering bias to initial population. Each attribute in the initial population is initialized with a probability inversely proportional to its entropy. Relevant attributes occurring more frequently in the initial population provide a good start for GA to search for better fit rules at earlier generations. The results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed system for automated rule mining.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640477","startPage":"491","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640477.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm with entropy based initial bias for automated rule mining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640477/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm with entropy based initial bias for automated rule mining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640477/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11661841","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm with entropy based initial bias for automated rule mining","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"76391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055768S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5640479,"authors":[{"name":"Sangeeta Sabharwal","affiliation":["Department of computer Science and IT, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Sangeeta","lastName":"Sabharwal","id":"37589573600"},{"name":"Ritu Sibal","affiliation":["Department of computer Science and IT, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ritu","lastName":"Sibal","id":"37589570300"},{"name":"Chayanika Sharma","affiliation":["Department of computer Science and IT, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Chayanika","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37602815100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9034-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9033-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9032-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5640479","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Gallium","Unified modeling language","Software testing","Software","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software testing","program error","critical path cluster","test case scenario","activity diagram","genetic algorithm","information flow metric","information flow complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software testing","genetic algorithm","activity diagram","CFG"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640479","abstract":"Software testing involves identifying the test cases which discovers the errors in the program.

The scheme works in two very simple steps. At the transmitter side, one data symbol is modulated on to a group of adjacent sub-carriers with a group of weighting coefficients. The weighting coefficients are designed such that the ICI caused by the channel frequency errors can be minimized. At the receiver side, by linearly combining the received signal on these sub-carriers with proposed coefficients, the residual ICI contained in the received signal can then be further reduced. In this paper performance of Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver has been simulated in terms of carrier-to-interference (CIR) ratio and bit error rate (BER) performance. In this paper BER curves were used to evaluate the performance of ICI self-cancellation scheme. It is observed from the figure that in presence of small frequency offset and binary alphabet size, self cancellation gives the best results. From figure it has been concluded that BER of standard OFDM with ICI self cancellation using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is better than BER of standard OFDM with ICI self cancellation using quardrature phase shift keying (QPSK). ICI self cancellation scheme is used for lower frequency offset values and lower modulation schemes like BPSK But as self cancellation scheme does not require very complex hardware and software implementation this scheme gives the best result for lower frequency offset and alphabet size.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640503","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640503.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM mobile systems for wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640503/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of OFDM mobile systems for wireless communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661897","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640503/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of OFDM mobile systems for wireless communication","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"52473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099525S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5640520,"authors":[{"name":"Sampath Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, J.

Watermarking is one such technique for protecting the digital data like image, video and audio signal. In this paper, digital image watermarking technique is proposed for protecting the digital images based on discrete wavelet transform due its excellent spatial localization, frequency spread and multi-resolution analysis similar to human visual system. The method involves a visual watermark (grayscale image) which is transformed using discrete cosine transform for getting low frequency coefficients in frequency domain. The low frequency coefficients of transformed watermark image contain maximum visual data information. Then, the original image is transformed using the discrete wavelet transform and watermark is embedded by modifying the coefficients of LL bands with appropriate imperceptibility and robustness. The multi-energy watermarking technique using the qualified significant wavelet tree (QSWT) are used to select the locations for embedding and extracting image watermark. QSWT provides robustness by allowing adaptive casting energy in different resolutions available from the wavelet transform. The performance of this scheme is robust to sharpening, smoothening, JPEG compression and image cropping.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5616735/5640373/05640527.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind digital image watermarking using adpative casting energy in different resolutions of wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Robustness","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","industrial property","ubiquitous computing","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind digital image watermarking","adaptive casting energy","ubiquitous computing","intellectual property","digital data protection","discrete wavelet transform","spatial localization","multiresolution analysis","human visual system","grayscale image","discrete cosine transform","maximum visual data information","multienergy watermarking technique","qualified significant wavelet tree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Image Watermark","Discrete Cosine Transfor","Discrete Wavelet Transform","Orthonormal filter bank","Qualified Significant Wavelet tree"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind digital image watermarking using adpative casting energy in different resolutions of wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640527/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661920","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind digital image watermarking using adpative casting energy in different resolutions of wavelet transform","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"39547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048261S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5616735","isNumber":"5640373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5616735","xplore-issue":"5640373","articleId":"5640527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5640552,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Yang","affiliation":["College of Commercial Studies, Sichuan Agricultural University, Dujiangyan Campus, Dujiangyan, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37533321800"},{"name":"Guozhu He","affiliation":["College of Commercial Studies, Sichuan Agricultural University, Dujiangyan Campus, Dujiangyan, China"],"firstName":"Guozhu","lastName":"He","id":"37528606000"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["College of Commercial Studies, Sichuan Agricultural University, Dujiangyan Campus, Dujiangyan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"37539240200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6498-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6495-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6497-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-2914"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-2922"}],"articleNumber":"5640552","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Conferences","Convergence","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","global optimization","local search","standard PSO","improved PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","local search","global optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640552","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most famous nature-inspired algorithms, which has shown good performance on many optimization problems.

Although MBMS supports multimedia streams with several resolutions, streams with different resolutions are treated as separate services and transmitted upon independent radio resources, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. At the receiver, some valuable information embedded in the higher-resolution channels is not utilized to enhance the reception of the data stream in a lower resolution channel. In this work, we propose a multilevel coupling modulation (MCM) scheme aimed to improve the overall system throughput and to extend the service coverage of the multi-resolution MBMS in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed MCM scheme can fully utilize all the usable information conveyed in different channels, thereby improving the receiving performance. In addition, we derive the symbol error rates of the proposed MCM scheme, in the AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels, for performance evaluation. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MCM scheme can substantially enhance the receiving performance, service accessibility and overall system throughput of multi-resolution MBMS in OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110910.090514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5688266/05640585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110910.090514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688266","startPage":"141","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel Coupling Modulation for Multi-Resolution Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Coupling Modulation for Multi-Resolution Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744654","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5640585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Coupling Modulation for Multi-Resolution Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"141-tc1101-tsai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081381S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5640585","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5640586,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5688266/5640586/5640586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Li received his B.

We adopt a multi-hop decode-and-forward relay protocol such that two canonical subnetworks are relevant, namely broadcast channel with receiver side information (BC-RSI) and orthogonal multiple access channel with correlated sources and receiver side information (MAC-CS-RSI). A joint network and channel coding (JNCC) strategy is proposed by exploiting ARQ, RSI, and correlated sources. The proposed JNCC strategy does not require the knowledge of RSI nor any transmit channel state information, such that each transmitter simply performs retransmissions until the intended receivers have accumulated enough mutual information to successfully decode all desired messages. This successful decoding is then conveyed from the receivers to the respective transmitters via an acknowledgement message. To measure the performance of the proposed JNCC strategy with ARQ, we derive closed-form expressions of network throughput by applying the renewal-reward theorem. Analytical results show that the proposed JNCC strategy outperforms, in terms of network throughput, the conventional separate network and channel coding strategy with random linear network coding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110910.090545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5688266/05640586.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"193","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110910.090545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Network and Channel Coding Strategy for Wireless Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Network and Channel Coding Strategy for Wireless Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5640586/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744679","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Network and Channel Coding Strategy for Wireless Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"181-tc1101-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136827S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5640586","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5640588,"authors":[{"name":"Man-On Pun","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5688266/5640588/5640588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Man-On Pun (M'06) received the BEng.

In particular, we study linear rake receivers with selective combining, maximum ratio combining and optimal combining in which signals received from all antennas of each mobile terminal (MT) are linearly combined to improve the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). By exploiting limited feedback on the effective SINRs, the base station (BS) schedules simultaneous data transmission on multiple beams to the MTs with the largest effective SINRs. Using extreme value theory, the average sum-rates and their scaling laws for JOSRD are derived. In particular, it is shown that the limiting distribution of the effective signal-to-interference (SIR) is of the Frechet-type whereas that of the effective SINR converges to the Gumbel-type. Furthermore, the SIR-based sum-rate scaling laws are found to follow \u03b5 log K with 0<;\u03b5<;1, which stands in contrast to the SINR-based scaling laws governed by the conventional log log K form. Both analytical and simulation results confirm that significant performance improvement can be achieved by incorporating low-complexity linear combining techniques into the design of scheduling schemes in MIMO-SDMA downlink systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Joint Opportunistic Scheduling and Receiver Design for MIMO-SDMA Downlink Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110910.090175","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5688266/05640588.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.110910.090175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Joint Opportunistic Scheduling and Receiver Design for MIMO-SDMA Downlink Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5640588/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11744680","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Joint Opportunistic Scheduling and Receiver Design for MIMO-SDMA Downlink Systems","sourcePdf":"268-tc1101-pun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104867S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5688266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5688266","articleId":"5640588","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5640604,"authors":[{"name":"Koen Bertels","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Koen Bertels is an associate professor in the Computer Engineering Lab, at Delft University of Technology.

The time-domain SPE is realized by stretching and compressing the ultrashort optical pulse through two-chirped fiber Bragg gratings with opposite dispersion and a high-speed PM for optical code (OC) generation and data modulation. The SPD has similar configuration as the SPE counterpart but using another PM synchronously driven by the complementary code pattern for OC recognition. Simulation investigation and experimental results both show that the code transition, dispersion mismatch between the encoding and decoding side, and the transmission fiber dispersion have detrimental effect on the en/decoding performance. In the experiment, 16-chip, 40-Gchip/s OC pattern and 2.5-Gb/s DPSK data modulation have been simultaneously generated using a single PM.

We propose a set of algorithms which are tested using a large database of real synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images. The highlights and shadows of the objects in an SAS image are segmented using both a Markovian algorithm and the active contours algorithm. The comparison of both segmentation results is used as a feature for classification. In addition, other features are considered. These include geometrical shape descriptors, not only of the shadow region, but also of the object highlight, which demonstrates a significant improvement of the performance. Furthermore, a novel set of features based on the image statistics is described. Finally, we propose an optimal feature set that leads to the best classification results for the available database.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2093868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5767682/05640637.pdf","endPage":"468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Feature Set for Automatic Detection and Classification of Underwater Objects in SAS Images","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2093868","startPage":"454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Feature Set for Automatic Detection and Classification of Underwater Objects in SAS Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640637/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12004764","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5640637/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Feature Set for Automatic Detection and Classification of Underwater Objects in SAS Images","sourcePdf":"jstsp-fandos-2093868-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108777S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5767682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5767682","articleId":"5640637","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5640638,"authors":[{"name":"Aixin Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Aixin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291139000"},{"name":"Yanjun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599093300"},{"name":"Zhizhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhizhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278564400"},{"name":"Shunfeng Cao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antenna and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shunfeng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37593565500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5640638","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4009},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Microstrip antenna arrays","Bandwidth","Microstrip","Feeds","Impedance","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance matching","microstrip antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ka-Band high-gain circularly polarized microstrip antenna array","four-element high-gain circularly polarized microstrip antenna array","sequentially rotated series-parallel stub technique","feed network","symmetrical positioning","microstrip patch elements","L-shaped matching branch","impedance matching","spatial flexibility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array","circular polarization","feed network","microstrip antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a four-element high-gain circularly polarized microstrip antenna array operating in the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ka</i>\n -band is proposed.

It uses the body as the signal transmission media. Compared with existing body area network (BAN) schemes, EF-IBC can achieve higher data rate with less transmission power. Until now, the detailed EF-IBC channel mechanism is not well understood. In this work, finite-element method (FEM) is utilized for the first time to investigate the EF-IBC channel. A circuit-coupled FEM model is established for the EF-IBC channel. The FEM model is extensively verified by experimental measurements. The new physical model enables the revelation of characteristics and effects of different components in the EF-IBC channel. The FEM investigation finds that the capacitive return path is critical to the characteristics of the EF-IBC channel. Parameters of the capacitive return path are quantitatively measured. The investigation also finds that the body plays an important role to the return path capacitance. The forward body path can be well modeled by a cascade of \u03c0-shaped circuits. Based on the FEM model of the EF-IBC channel, a simplified circuit model is derived to provide an efficient tool for the transceiver design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric-Field Intrabody Communication Channel Modeling With Finite-Element Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2093933","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5719227/05640659.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2093933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Electric-Field Intrabody Communication Channel Modeling With Finite-Element Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5640659/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11833726","pubMedId":"21095853","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric-Field Intrabody Communication Channel Modeling With Finite-Element Method","sourcePdf":"tbme-xu-2093933-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060647S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5719227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5719227","articleId":"5640659","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5640660,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Ching Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5673443/5640660/5640660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Ching Huang (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical and control engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2009 under the supervision of Prof. Kwang-Ting Cheng.","After receiving the B.S. degree, he served as a Telecommunication Officer with the Army Artillery and Missile School of Taiwan for his compulsory military service until 2003.

The proposed boosting color-component feature selection framework is designed for finding the best set of color-component features from various color spaces (or models), aiming to achieve the best FR performance for a given FR task. In addition, to facilitate the complementary effect of the selected color-component features for the purpose of color FR, they are combined using the proposed weighted feature fusion scheme. The effectiveness of our color FR method has been successfully evaluated on the following five public face databases (DBs): CMU-PIE, Color FERET, XM2VTSDB, SCface, and FRGC 2.0. Experimental results show that the results of the proposed method are impressively better than the results of other state-of-the-art color FR methods over different FR challenges including highly uncontrolled illumination, moderate pose variation, and small resolution face images.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5750157/05640669.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2093906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2093906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5750157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting Color Feature Selection for Color Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Boosting","Feature extraction","Training","Color","Face","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boosting color feature selection","color face recognition","color-component feature selection framework","color spaces","weighted feature fusion scheme","XM2VTSDB","SCface","FRGC 2.0","CMU-PIE","color FERET","state-of-the-art color FR methods","uncontrolled illumination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boosting learning","color face recognition","color space","color-component","feature selection","weighted feature fusion"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Color","Databases, Factual","Face","Image Enhancement","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Boosting Color Feature Selection for Color Face Recognition","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5640669/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11960245","pubMedId":"21095868","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting Color Feature Selection for Color Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-choi-2093906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088035S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5750157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5750157","articleId":"5640669","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5640675,"authors":[{"name":"Sinno Jialin Pan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5710128/5640675/5640675-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sinno Jialin Pan received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2010.","He is currently a Research Fellow at the Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore.

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2091281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2091281","startPage":"199","endPage":"210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5710128/05640675.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain Adaptation via Transfer Component Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Domain Adaptation via Transfer Component Analysis","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11793995","pubMedId":"21095864","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5640675/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Adaptation via Transfer Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnn-pan-2091281-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112573S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5710128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"1467","xplore-issue":"5710128","articleId":"5640675","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5640676,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Shen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5680555/5640676/5640676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Shen received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2003.

However, they often need to know the source number a priori, which is very inconvenient in practice. In this paper, a new method, namely nonlinear projection and column masking (NPCM), is proposed to estimate the mixing matrix. A major advantage of NPCM is that it does not need any knowledge of the source number. In NPCM, the objective function is based on a nonlinear projection and its maxima just correspond to the columns of the mixing matrix. Thus a column can be estimated first by locating a maximum and then deflated by a masking operation. This procedure is repeated until the evaluation of the objective function decreases to zero dramatically. Thus the mixing matrix and the number of sources are estimated simultaneously. Because the masking procedure may result in some small and useless local maxima, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to optimize the objective function. Feasibility and efficiency of PSO are also discussed. Comparative experimental results show the efficiency of NPCM, especially in the cases where the number of sources is unknown and the sources are relatively less sparse.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2091427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2091427","endPage":"221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5710128/05640677.pdf","startPage":"211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixing Matrix Estimation From Sparse Mixtures With Unknown Number of Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640677/","displayDocTitle":"Mixing Matrix Estimation From Sparse Mixtures With Unknown Number of Sources","volume":"22","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11793996","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","pubMedId":"21095863","htmlLink":"/document/5640677/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixing Matrix Estimation From Sparse Mixtures With Unknown Number of Sources","sourcePdf":"tnn-xie-2091427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126142S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5710128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5710128","articleId":"5640677","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5640678,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Yangzhou University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5975345/5640678/5640678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Jiang (S\u201908\u2013M\u201910) was born in Yangzhou, China, in 1980.

In order to remedy this problem, simultaneous usage of renewable sources and energy storages is encouraged. A multiconverter system is commonly adopted to process the renewable power in form of distributed generation. However, due to the discrete structure of such systems, power flow and load regulation are coordinated via communication channel, which inevitably reduces the reliability and dynamic response of the system. This paper presents the concept of multiport power electronic interface (MPEI) for renewable energy sources and storages. With a unified modular topology and highly integrated digital control system, controlled quasi-current source is achieved for each input port in both steady-state and transient power-sharing modes. MPEI analysis, modeling, design, and system operation are treated in a systematic manner in this paper. Both power stages and digital control system are implemented for a five-port MPEI. Experiments are conducted under meaningful operation scenarios. The results are presented to prove the feasibility of MPEI concept and system design methodology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Switches","Voltage control","Topology","Load modeling","Energy storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","power convertors","power electronics","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["renewable sources","energy storages","multiconverter system","distributed generation","power flow","load regulation","multiport power electronic interface","unified modular topology","highly integrated digital control system","controlled quasi-current source"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Controlled quasi-current source (CQCS)","energy storage","fuel cell","multiport power electronic interface (MPEI)","power sharing","power transfer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5975345/05640678.pdf","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2093583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiport Power Electronic Interface\u2014Concept, Modeling, and Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiport Power Electronic Interface\u2014Concept, Modeling, and Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640678/","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640678/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205307","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiport Power Electronic Interface\u2014Concept, Modeling, and Design","sourcePdf":"tpel-jiang-2093583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141151S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5975345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"5975345","articleId":"5640678","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5640682,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["School of ECS., University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5640682/5640682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong Zhang (M'10) received the B.Eng. degree in communications engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree with distinction in radio frequency communications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He was a System Engineer with the Mobile Communications Division, China Telecom, and is currently a Research Fellow with the Communications Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton.

A combination of error detecting circuits and micro-architectural recovery mechanisms creates a system that is robust in the face of timing errors, and can be tuned to an efficient operating point by dynamically eliminating unused timing margins. Savings from margin reclamation can be realized as per device power-efficiency improvement, or parametric yield improvement for a batch of devices. In this paper, we apply Razor to a 32 bit ARM processor with a micro-architecture design that has balanced pipeline stages with critical memory access and clock-gating enable paths. The design is fabricated on a UMC 65 nm process, using industry standard EDA tools, with a worst-case STA signoff of 724 MHz. Based on measurements on 87 samples from split-lots, we obtain 52% power reduction for the overall distribution at 1 GHz operation. We present error rate driven dynamic voltage and frequency scaling schemes where runtime adaptation to PVT variations and tolerance of fast transients is demonstrated. All Razor cells are augmented with a sticky error history bit, allowing precise diagnosis of timing errors over the execution of test vectors. We show potential for parametric yield improvement through energy-efficient operation using Razor.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2079410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2079410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5673672/05640683.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power-Efficient 32 bit ARM Processor Using Timing-Error Detection and Correction for Transient-Error Tolerance and Adaptation to PVT Variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Power-Efficient 32 bit ARM Processor Using Timing-Error Detection and Correction for Transient-Error Tolerance and Adaptation to PVT Variation","volume":"46","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640683/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704576","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640683/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power-Efficient 32 bit ARM Processor Using Timing-Error Detection and Correction for Transient-Error Tolerance and Adaptation to PVT Variation","sourcePdf":"jssc-das-2079410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081334S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5673672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5673672","articleId":"5640683","onlineDate":"18 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5640684,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Miri Lavasani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5673672/5640684/5640684-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Miri Lavasani (S'99\u2013M'10) was born in 1979 in Tehran, Iran.

The TIA consists of a low-power broadband current pre-amplifler combined with a current-to-voltage conversion stage to boost the input current before delivering it to feedback voltage amplifiers. Using this approach, the TIA achieves a constant gain of 76 dB-Ohm up to 1.7 GHz when connected to a 2 pF load at the input and output with an input-referred noise below 10 pA/\u221a(Hz) in the 100 MHz to 1 GHz range. The TIA is fabricated in a 1P6M 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process and consumes 7.2 mW. To demonstrate its performance in high frequency lateral micromechanical oscillator applications, the TIA is wirebonded to a 724 MHz high-motional resistance (Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unloaded</sub>\n \u2248 2000, R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n \u2248 750 \u03a9, C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n \u2248 2 pF) and a 1.006 GHz high-parasitic (Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unloaded</sub>\n \u2248 7100, R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n \u2248 150 \u03a9, C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n \u2248 3.2 pF) AIN-on-Silicon resonator.

Therefore, measurement of PD events can be used to assess the condition of the insulation.

In this paper, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model for simulation of PD activity within a spherical cavity in a homogeneous dielectric material has been developed. The model has been used to study the influence of amplitude of the applied voltage on PD activity.

The basic model of the CRN provides signaling through cognitive pilot channels (CPCs) distributed in every available channel or frequency slot. The control is performed by using frequency-division and time-division multiplexing techniques. This control, as expected, permits the utilization of the CRN by heterogeneous cognitive radio user (CRU) devices. We had designed a CRN able to work with today's available technologies and CRU devices that use different frequency bands of operation. However, in terms of energy, this control can be very inefficient due to the fact that at specific periods of time, the network might be completely used. Results of the performance of the network will be compared to a basic CRN model in which CPCs are used for control in every available channel.","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2010.5640983","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608543/5640972/05640983.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2010.5640983","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy reduction for centralized cognitive radio networks with distributed cognitive pilot channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5640983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy reduction for centralized cognitive radio networks with distributed cognitive pilot channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5640983/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5640983/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11656284","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy reduction for centralized cognitive radio networks with distributed cognitive pilot channels","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"73690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093334S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608543","isNumber":"5640972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608543","xplore-issue":"5640972","articleId":"5640983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5641006,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Guzzo","affiliation":["Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica y Autom\u00e1tica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Guzzo","id":"37599188600"},{"name":"Marcelo Segura","affiliation":["Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica y Autom\u00e1tica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Segura","id":"37586942700"},{"name":"Juan Pablo Aguiar","affiliation":["Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica y Autom\u00e1tica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Pablo Aguiar","id":"38256739300"},{"name":"H.

Because of this needs in this work a PLC link control is developed to maximize the information rate meanwhile the bit error rate (BER) is maintained under a desired reference limit. The developed control system has a unique variable called minimal total distance and the feedback loop signal is estimated from the low-density parity check (LDPC) decoder iterations. These mentioned characteristics enable a fast and simple control scheme. In order to evaluate the control system behavior a complete Powerline (PL) link was modeled in a matrix form and simulated with a measured PL channel model and with an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The implemented PL link reaches 570 Mbps in AWGN. Finally the BER control shows a good response under a severe random walk SNR channel variation.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608543/5640972/05641006.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PLC link control based on minimal total distance and LDPC codes","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2010.5641006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2010.5641006","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"PLC link control based on minimal total distance and LDPC codes","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11656262","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5641006/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PLC link control based on minimal total distance and LDPC codes","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"73153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093732S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608543","isNumber":"5640972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608543","xplore-issue":"5640972","articleId":"5641006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5641009,"authors":[{"name":"Glauber Gomes de Oliveira Brante","affiliation":["CPGEI, Federal University of Technology - Parana - Curitiba-PR, Brazil, Brazil"],"firstName":"Glauber Gomes","lastName":"de Oliveira Brante","id":"37591030000"},{"name":"Daiana Nascimento Muniz","affiliation":["CPGEI, Federal University of Technology - Parana - Curitiba-PR, Brazil, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daiana","lastName":"Nascimento Muniz","id":"37087954189"},{"name":"Walter Godoy","affiliation":["CPGEI, Federal University of Technology - Paran\u00e1 - Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Godoy","id":"37369905300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7173-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7171-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7172-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"5641009","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641009","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Block codes","Bit error rate","Viterbi algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","computational complexity","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information set","soft decoding algorithm","block codes","suboptimum soft decoding algorithm","bit error rate","computational complexity","optimum decoding methods","maximum likelihood decoder","soft decision Viterbi algorithm","IS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block codes","Golay codes","sub-optimum decoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we introduce a new sub-optimum soft-decoding algorithm for block codes, based on information sets and erasures, which showed to be very efficient in terms of bit error rate and computational complexity when compared to optimum decoding methods.

A system based on ECOKB model and a specification language can process and produce gradual guide ways for full problem solving explanation. However, these systems limit users because they require the data input and the result output both not in natural language but specification language, which few users knows how to use this language input to the systems. Therefore, to improve ability of interacting by natural language, this paper proposes a new approach for translating mathematics problems in natural language to specification language as well as bringing out the model of natural language translating method associated with knowledge base domain for effective translation.

The absorption and the turbulence can be measured by means of a system free space optics (FSO) designed appropriately. In a continental typical region, where phenomena as rain, snow or fog are presented, the most important factor that produces losses of power is the dispersion of the light, though others exist as the presence of impurities (due to the air pollution) and the absorption. The attenuation due to the dispersion can be expressed as a function of the distance of the link, the wavelength and of the birefringence of the air with disturbances. This work describes the results obtained from the analysis of the propagation of the light in a contaminated atmosphere and of the availability of the link FSO, based on the measure of the ellipticity of a beam transmitted with circular polarization and of the calculation of the birefringence of the atmosphere, as a function of the distance of the link, the wavelength and the level of power received. It is presented a method to estimate the availability of a system FSO knowing the distance of the link and some physical characteristics of the atmosphere.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5608543/5640972/05641097.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/LATINCOM.2010.5641097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATINCOM.2010.5641097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640972","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circular polarization and availability in free space optics (FSO) communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric measurements","Pollution measurement","Atmospheric waves","Rotation measurement","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["birefringence","light propagation","optical communication","polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circular polarization","free space optics communication","atmospheric phenomena","light propagation","birefringence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorption","attenuation","atmospheric contamination","availability of link","birefringence","circular polarization","dispersion","ellipticity","FSO","SOP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Circular polarization and availability in free space optics (FSO) communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641097/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11656298","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circular polarization and availability in free space optics (FSO) communication systems","confLoc":"Bogota, Colombia","sourcePdf":"74177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065431S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5608543","isNumber":"5640972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5608543","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5640972","articleId":"5641097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5641119,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Navarro Cadavid","affiliation":["Icesi University, Cali, Colombia"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9s","lastName":"Navarro Cadavid","id":"37598980500"},{"name":"Dinael Guevara Ibarra","affiliation":["Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Dinael","lastName":"Guevara Ibarra","id":"38255425400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7173-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7171-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7172-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-989X"}],"articleNumber":"5641119","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Ray tracing","Games","Three dimensional displays","Physics","Solid modeling","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","public domain software","ray tracing","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing physics","open source game engine","computer graphics","software development","multiple diffraction","path loss","reflection algorithm","graphic processing unit","multiple processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","formatting","style","styling","insert"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows the used of a complete open source game engine and the significant advanced in computer graphics for applied ray tracing physics techniques in urban environment of propagation.

Under these uncertain demand conditions, we formulate product supply planning into multi-objective problem pursuing profit maximization and risk minimization. We will propose a method that can generate Pareto optimal solutions based on multi-objective Genetic Algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation. The method adopts searching mode switching strategy to obtain quality Pareto optimal solution, and the method consists of two layers; the upper layer is a global search stage and the lower one is a local search stage to search better solutions around global solutions. Since the local search stage is time consuming, we also propose a fast calculation method of evaluating individuals for Genetic Algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641164","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623495/5640954/05641164.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical planning method for product supply based on multi objective Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Planning","Mathematical model","Histograms","Equations","Gallium","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","Pareto optimisation","planning","risk management","supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical planning method","multiobjective genetic algorithm","dexterous supply plans","multi-objective problem pursuing profit maximization","risk minimization","product supply planning","Pareto optimal solutions","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical planning method for product supply based on multi objective Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641164/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662257","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical planning method for product supply based on multi objective Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF000108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058778S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623495","isNumber":"5640954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623495","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5640954","articleId":"5641164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-07"},{"_id":5641184,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Cavalieri","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering Department of Computer Science and Telecommunications Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Cavalieri","id":"37295958500"},{"name":"Giovanni Cutuli","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering Department of Computer Science and Telecommunications Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Cutuli","id":"37396084600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6850-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6848-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6849-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"5641184","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1259},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641184","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Security","Performance evaluation","Subscriptions","Monitoring","Data models","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","electronic data interchange","formal specification","performance evaluation","production engineering computing","production planning","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","vendor independent OPC UA specification","industrial application","software infrastructure","data exchange","client-server information exchange"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641184","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623495/5640954/05641184.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of OPC UA","abstract":"The widespread use of standard, worldwide and vendor-independent OPC UA specifications in industrial environment introduces many benefits as it allows to keep open the market of the industrial applications.

These systems must not only satisfy real-time requirements but they must also deliver the specified functionality in the presence of both software and hardware faults. To achieve fault-tolerance, systems have to use redundancy. This redundancy is usually achieved by replicating hardware units and executing the application within a distributed system. Model-based design tools promise to reduce the complexity of the design process by raising the abstraction level. However, most of the existing tools focus only on functional aspects. Code realizing extra-functional requirements such as fault-tolerance mechanisms, communication, and scheduling is not targeted. However, this type of code makes up the majority of the code of a fault-tolerant real-time system. This paper presents FTOS, a model-based development tool for the design of fault-tolerant automation systems that focuses on code generation of extra-functional requirements and therefore complements existing tools.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5641211/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662157","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FTOS: Model-driven development of fault-tolerant automation systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FTOS: Model-driven development of fault-tolerant automation systems","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF001104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060483S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623495","isNumber":"5640954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623495","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5640954","articleId":"5641211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5641299,"authors":[{"name":"Bakir Lacevic","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Bakir","lastName":"Lacevic","id":"37565739200"},{"name":"Paolo Rocco","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Rocco","id":"37274178600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6850-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6848-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6849-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"5641299","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Safety","Manipulators","Planning","Joints","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","human-robot interaction","manipulators","safety","sampling methods","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling based safe path planning","robotic manipulators","probabilistic roadmap planner","collision free path","quasirandom low discrepancy sequence","path construction","search algorithm","heuristic function","safety estimation","safety assessment","human robot interaction","collision free paths"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641299","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640954","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623495/5640954/05641299.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based safe path planning for robotic manipulators","abstract":"A novel method to obtain safe paths for robotic manipulators is presented. It emulates the probabilistic roadmap planner by trying to establish a collision-free path that connects the start and the goal configuration via samples that belong to a quasi-random, low discrepancy sequence. The path construction is guided by a search algorithm with a heuristic function that includes a suitably tailored safety estimation. The measure of safety is based on the danger field - a recently proposed safety assessment for human-robot interaction. Thus, the planner provides not only collision-free paths, but strives for safer ones. In order to decrease the expected number of collision checks, we propose a novel method for testing whether local paths are collision-free or not. The method combines the standard binary collision checking with the concept of bubbles of free configuration space.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5641299/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11662145","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based safe path planning for robotic manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based safe path planning for robotic manipulators","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF002607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06142S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623495","isNumber":"5640954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623495","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5640954","articleId":"5641299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5641310,"authors":[{"name":"Pau Mart\u00ed","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Pau","lastName":"Mart\u00ed","id":"37277828900"},{"name":"Antonio Camacho","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Camacho","id":"37397219200"},{"name":"Manel Velasco","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Velasco","id":"37266090800"},{"name":"Pere Mar\u00e9s","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Pere","lastName":"Mar\u00e9s","id":"37419013200"},{"name":"Josep M.

Effective approaches often require to impose periodic execution for the sampling and/or actuation operations, enforcing synchronized constant time delays. And considering that sampling and actuation is performed in different nodes, global time between nodes achieved by clock synchronization is the standard assumption or strategy that enables such synchronized operations. This paper presents a technique that permits to implement these synchronized operations in NCS in the absence of global time. Experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of the presented approach.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641310","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623495/5640954/05641310.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronizing sampling and actuation in the absence of global time in Networked Control Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synchronizing sampling and actuation in the absence of global time in Networked Control Systems","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641310/","accessionNumber":"11662173","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641310/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronizing sampling and actuation in the absence of global time in Networked Control Systems","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF002747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064614S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623495","isNumber":"5640954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623495","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5640954","articleId":"5641310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5641348,"authors":[{"name":"Mikel Larrea","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Automatic Control, Intelligent Control Research Group University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain"],"firstName":"Mikel","lastName":"Larrea","id":"37265234000"},{"name":"Eloy Irigoyen","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Automatic Control, Intelligent Control Research Group University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain"],"firstName":"Eloy","lastName":"Irigoyen","id":"37603061200"},{"name":"Vicente \u01f4omez","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Automatic Control, Intelligent Control Research Group University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain"],"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"\u01f4omez","id":"37587513700"},{"name":"Fernando Artaza","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Automatic Control, Intelligent Control Research Group University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Artaza","id":"37599127100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6850-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6848-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6849-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"CD","value":"1946-0740"}],"articleNumber":"5641348","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Training","Mathematical model","Control systems","Equations","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","identification","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system control","adaptive predictive strategy","adaptive predictive control","neural network controller","system identification","neural network identifier","nonlinear system dynamics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641348","abstract":"This paper presents an Adaptive Predictive Control strategy based on Neural Networks for nonlinear systems.

Model-driven design methodologies in the field of Industrial Automation and Control Systems, as proposed by the MEDEIA project, help to cope with current requirements like limited budget and reduced ramp-up time. Concurrent development in all involved domains is facilitated by the introduction of simulation in the development process. We propose the use of an IEC 61499 industrial automation runtime environment to simulate plants' behavior. The concept for the simulation framework is based on the coupling of the control application and the plant simulation application via Instrumentation and Control points. The introduction of physical links in the plant simulation application enhances the behavior model of the plants, thus increasing the quality of the obtained simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Automation","Unified modeling language","IEC standards","Adaptation model","Control systems","Production systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factory automation","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEC 61499 based simulation framework","model-driven production system development","industrial automation and control system","MEDEIA project","plant simulation application","physical links"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641364","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623495/5640954/05641364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEC 61499 based simulation framework for model-driven production systems development","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IEC 61499 based simulation framework for model-driven production systems development","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641364/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641364/","accessionNumber":"11662320","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEC 61499 based simulation framework for model-driven production systems development","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF003565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077958S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623495","isNumber":"5640954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623495","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5640954","articleId":"5641364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5641376,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichao Lu","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhichao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37595541900"},{"name":"Zhenming Zhou","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenming","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37597262500"},{"name":"Jerry G.

At Vdd = IV, using asymmetric source-underlap access transistors can improve RSNM while degrading WSNM; using source-underlap pull-up transistors can improve WSNM without sacrificing RSNM. Thus, the conflict between improving RSNM and WSNM in 6T FinFET SRAM cell can be relaxed by using the asymmetric source/drain underlap access and pull-up transistors (PUAX_Asym.). We also show, for the first time, that as Vdd is reduced (e.g. <; 0.6V), the effectiveness of using asymmetric source/drain-underlap access transistors to improve RSNM diminishes due to the worse electrostatic integrity caused by the underlap. At Vdd = IV, the 6T PUAX_Asym.

Using the MSB Re-PGM scheme, threshold voltage distribution width is improved about 200 mV. The PGM throughput is enhanced from 1500 \u03bcs to 1250 \u03bcs. With the Moving Read scheme about half order of UBER is improved with 10 bit ECC. Also, Adaptive Code Selection scheme are used to decrease a current consumption. There is 5.5% current reduction. With these techniques, 32-Gb MLC NAND flash memory has been fabricated using a 32 nm CMOS process technology. Its program throughput reaches 13.0 MB/s at a multi-plane program operation with cache operation keeping a desirable threshold voltage distribution.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2084450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5673672/05641590.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2084450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 32-Gb MLC NAND Flash Memory With Vth Endurance Enhancing Schemes in 32 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A 32-Gb MLC NAND Flash Memory With Vth Endurance Enhancing Schemes in 32 nm CMOS","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5641590/","accessionNumber":"11704578","volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 32-Gb MLC NAND Flash Memory With Vth Endurance Enhancing Schemes in 32 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-lee-2084450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090233S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5673672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5673672","articleId":"5641590","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5641604,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Heng Tseng","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, STAR Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5673443/5641604/5641604-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Heng Tseng was born in Taiwan on November 16, 1982.

In this paper, discrete equations for MTLs exposed to incident fields are derived based on the time-domain finite-element method and the backward differentiation formula. Based on these equations, a value-delivery table characterizing the MTLs is presented. Combining this table with modified node analysis formulation, it is convenient for analyzing the responses of transmission lines composed of complex termination networks or complex transmission-lines networks. The validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using several examples. Finally, a 1-km 35 kV overhead line above an imperfectly conducting ground is studied, and the influences of ground wire and a metal-oxide arrester to the lightning-induced voltage are both discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5770372/05641606.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2010.2083653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2010.2083653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Finite-Element Method for the Transient Response of Multiconductor Transmission Lines Excited by an Electromagnetic Field","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Time domain analysis","Transient analysis","Power transmission lines","Conductors","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arresters","electromagnetic fields","finite element analysis","multiconductor transmission lines","overhead line conductors","time-domain analysis","transient response","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain finite-element method","transient response","multiconductor transmission lines","electromagnetic field","discrete equations","backward differentiation formula","value-delivery table","modified node analysis formulation","complex termination networks","complex transmission-lines networks","overhead line","imperfectly conducting ground","ground wire","metal-oxide arrester","lightning-induced voltage","distance 1 km","voltage 35 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic (EM) coupling","finite-element methods","multiconductor transmission lines (MTLs)","nonlinear circuits","transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Finite-Element Method for the Transient Response of Multiconductor Transmission Lines Excited by an Electromagnetic Field","volume":"53","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5641606/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12006908","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Finite-Element Method for the Transient Response of Multiconductor Transmission Lines Excited by an Electromagnetic Field","sourcePdf":"temc-liu-2083653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112631S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5770372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5770372","articleId":"5641606","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5641608,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Barret","affiliation":["Signal Team, \u00e9cole Sup\u00e9rieure \u010f\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (SUPELEC), Information, Multimodality, Metz, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5753065/5641608/5641608-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michel Barret was born in Argenteuil, France on April 7, 1960.

The DWT used is the Daubechies 9/7. However, the spectral transform depends on the spectrometer sensor and the kind of images to be encoded. It is calculated once and for all on a set of images (the learning basis) from (only) one sensor, thanks to Akam Bita et al. 's OrthOST algorithm that returns an orthogonal spectral transform, whose optimality in high-rate coding has been recently proved under mild conditions. The spectral transform obtained in this way is applied to encode other images from the same sensor. Quantization and entropy coding are then achieved with a well-suited extension to hyperspectral images of the Said and Pearlman's SPIHT algorithm.

Practically, a resolver generates periodic position errors because of the amplitude imbalance and imperfect quadrature between the two output signals of the resolver. As a result, the dq-axis currents of the synchronous reference frame have ripple components that are twice the stator fundamental frequency. In this paper, the effects of the position errors are analyzed on the basis of the synchronous dq-axis current equations, including the position errors. The \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n-axis current is directly used as the input signal of the proposed compensator to estimate the position errors by using a simple integral operation according to the rotor position, because the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n-axis current is typically constant or zero. The proposed algorithm additionally considers the bandwidth effect of the closed current control loop to estimate the exact error signals according to the variation of the rotor speed. Therefore, the proposed algorithm does not need any additional hardware and much computation time. Furthermore, this algorithm can be applied to both the steady and transient states. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2091477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5688725/05641615.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"143","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2091477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of Amplitude Imbalance and Imperfect Quadrature in Resolver Signals for PMSM Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of Amplitude Imbalance and Imperfect Quadrature in Resolver Signals for PMSM Drives","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5641615/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769261","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of Amplitude Imbalance and Imperfect Quadrature in Resolver Signals for PMSM Drives","sourcePdf":"tia-kim-2091477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057206S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5688725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5688725","articleId":"5641615","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5641616,"authors":[{"name":"Xinmiao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5702426/5641616/5641616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinmiao Zhang (S'04-M'05\u2013SM'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota\u2014Twin Cities, Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.","Since then, she has been with Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, where she is currently a Timothy E. and Allison L.

However, it may suffer from interference near the sector boundary when applied to the downlink with universal frequency reuse. This interference may not sufficiently be handled by a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-type receiver. To alleviate the interference problem, we consider the use of multisector eigenbeamforming (MEB) in an MMSE receiver, which requires cooperation between adjacent sectors in the same cell. We analyze the performance of the MEB with the use of long-term channel information in terms of the ergodic capacity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed MEB near the sector boundary is verified by computer simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","volume":"60","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11807403","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641626/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multisector Eigenbeamforming With MMSE Reception in Spatially Correlated Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisector Eigenbeamforming With MMSE Reception in Spatially Correlated Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yeom-2093934-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070304S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5641626","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5641628,"authors":[{"name":"Shanthi Pavan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5702426/5641628/5641628-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shanthi Pavan received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), Chennai, India, in 1995 and the M.S and Sc.D degrees from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.","From 1997 to 2000, he was with Texas Instruments, Warren, NJ, working on high-speed analog filters and data converters.

A new class of parametric unitary transforms can be obtained from the proposed transform by choosing all its independent parameters from the unit circle. One of the special cases of this class is then exploited for developing a new one-parameter involutory discrete Hartley transform (DHT). The proposed parametric DFT and DHT can be computed using the existing fast algorithms of the DFT and DHT, respectively, with computational complexities similar to those of the latter. Indeed, for some special cases, the proposed transforms require less number of operations. In view of the fact that the transforms of small sizes are used in some image and video compression techniques and employed as building blocks for larger size transform algorithms, we develop new algorithms for the proposed small-size transforms. The proposed parametric DFT and DHT, in view of the introduction of the independent parameters, offer more flexibility in achieving better performance compared to the classical DFT and DHT. As examples of possible applications of the proposed transforms, image compression, Wiener filtering, and spectral analysis are considered.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2072151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5719221/05641630.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2072151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719221","startPage":"562","endPage":"575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Parametric Discrete Fourier and Hartley Transforms, and Algorithms for Fast Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Parametric Discrete Fourier and Hartley Transforms, and Algorithms for Fast Computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11835879","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5641630/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Parametric Discrete Fourier and Hartley Transforms, and Algorithms for Fast Computation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-swamy-2072151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143726S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5719221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5719221","articleId":"5641630","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5641632,"authors":[{"name":"Jijun Yao","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5685336/5641632/5641632-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jijun Yao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2009.","He was involved with RF circuit design for four years with Huawei Technologies, Shanghai, China.

Eureka 147 uses dedicated spectrum; DRM and IBOC reuse existing spectrum. In addition, SDAR makes use of terrestrial as well as satellite systems (XM and Sirius). Digital tuner costs vary from US$150.00 to US$1,000.00. Table 3 shows a comparison of each type of system. Although a principal purpose of DR is the enhancement of audio quality, this technology offers additional features such as the ability to integrate and broadcast text, data, and video, weather service information, and satellite maps of your location. In addition, DR technology is adopting the use of software to defined radio capabilities and features that will result in longer equipment life cycles and using common equipment in diverse applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital audio broadcasting","Standards","Performance evaluation","Audio systems","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital audio broadcasting","digital radio","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast technology standards","DR","digital radio","DAB","digital audio broadcast","Eureka 147","DRM","IBOC","satellite digital audio radio","weather service information","satellite maps"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MVT.2010.939105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10209/5641637/05641649.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVT.2010.939105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Audio Around the World","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Audio Around the World","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641649/","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641649/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11656153","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Audio Around the World","sourcePdf":"05mvt04-bodson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046281S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"5641637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5641637","articleId":"5641649","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5641651,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris E.

To work around potentially computational intractability, the proposed scheme exploits heuristics in consideration of both global and local exploration the step size of the CMA.

of the recent developments in both wireless technologies and low power electronics, wireless devices consume less and less power and are promising the possibility to operate continuously by using energy harvesting technologies. The interest in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), powered by environment energy harvesters, has been increasing over the last decade, especially those using thermal energy harvesting. In this paper, a low temperature thermal energy harvesting system, which can harvest heat energy from a temperature gradient and convert it into electrical energy, which can be used to power wireless electronics, is proposed. A prototype based on three subsystems is presented to extract heat energy from a radiator and use it to power ZigBee electronics. High efficiency and a long system lifetime are two of the main advantages of this design. The experimental results show that a maximum of 150 mW power can be harvested by the prototype and the system can continue to operate normally when the harvesting voltage is as low as 0.45 V. Theoretical calculations suggest that by placing the two AA batteries by proposed thermal energy harvesting system, a ZigBee Wireless Radiator Valve can operate for more than eight years.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11664441","htmlLink":"/document/5641673/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Thermal energy harvesting for WSNs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal energy harvesting for WSNs","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"461SMC135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064945S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5641711,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew L.

An output of most model checkers is a counterexample: an execution trace illustrating exactly how a specification was violated. In most analysis environments, this output is a list of the model variables and their values at each step in the execution trace. We have developed a language for modeling human task behavior and an automated method which translates instantiated models into a formal system model implemented in the language of the Symbolic Analysis Laboratory (SAL). This allows us to use model checking formal verification to evaluate human-automation interaction. In this paper we present an operational concept and design showing how our task modeling visual notation and system modeling architecture can be exploited to visualize counterexamples produced by SAL. We illustrate the use of our design with a model related to the operation of an automobile with a simple cruise control.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","formal verification","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task analytic models","model checker counterexamples visualization","automated formal verification","symbolic analysis laboratory","cruise control","automobile operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human-automation interaction","task analysis","model checking","formal methods","counterexample visualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641711","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05641711.pdf","startPage":"2069","endPage":"2074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using task analytic models to visualize model checker counterexamples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using task analytic models to visualize model checker counterexamples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641711/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641711/","accessionNumber":"11664488","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using task analytic models to visualize model checker counterexamples","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"314SMC32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057755S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":5641721,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Faria","affiliation":["GECAD-Knowledge Engineering and Decision Support Research Center, Institute of Engineering, Polytechnic of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Faria","id":"37602431200"},{"name":"Zita A.

This method is more popular because it is a straight forward fitness formulation and computationally efficient. However, this approach has some limitations because of the difficulty in selecting an appropriate weight for each objective and the need for some knowledge about the problems. The weight selection is usually based on trial and error and which impractical for complex engineering problems. In order to overcome these problems, the authors of this paper propose a new self organizing genetic algorithm (SOGA) for multi-objective optimization problems. The SOGA involves GA within the GA evaluation process which optimally tunes the weight of each objective function and applies a weighted-sum approach for fitness evaluation process. This algorithm has been tested for optimization of components placement on printed circuit board. The results show that SOGA is able to obtain a better minimum value as compared to random weight GA method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641746","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1021","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05641746.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new self organizing multi-objective optimization method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","genetic algorithms","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self organizing multiobjective optimization","weighted sum genetic algorithm","fitness formulation","weight selection","complex engineering problem","self organizing genetic algorithm","multi-objective optimization problem","GA evaluation process","printed circuit board","random weight GA method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","optimization","multi-objective problem","weighted-sum approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new self organizing multi-objective optimization method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641746/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new self organizing multi-objective optimization method","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"152SMC35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05133S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5641760,"authors":[{"name":"Takeya Matsui","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics Frontiers, Kanagawa University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeya","lastName":"Matsui","id":"37592922500"},{"name":"Masato Noto","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics Frontiers, Kanagawa University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Noto","id":"37354510700"},{"name":"Masanobu Numazawa","affiliation":["Department of Information and Management Science, Otaru University of Commerce, Otaru, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanobu","lastName":"Numazawa","id":"37602780000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5641760","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641760","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an optimization method that emulates the behavior of creatures such as a flock of birds or a school of fish. Two typical PSO information exchange formats are the Gbest model and the Lbest model. The Gbest model is the most basic model, but this model can converge quickly on a solution and may become trapped at a local solution. On the other hand, the Lbest model converges slowly on the solution but its global search capability is better. In this study, we propose a method of remedying the drawback of PSO in that it tends to become trapped at a local solution, by maintaining the diversity of the search by a global search using the Lbest model in the early stages of the search, then switching to a local search by the Gbest model in the final stages. We also confirm the validity of this method by simulation experiments using benchmark problems. As a result, we confirmed that accuracy of discovery of the optimal solution was increased, although convergence on the solution was somewhat delayed.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641760","startPage":"411","endPage":"416","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and

This paper proposes a multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization with a representation scheme based on binary search (BS-MOCLPSO) to deal with this problem in general hospital. The bed allocation problem (BAP) is first modeled as an M/PH/c queue. Based on the queuing theory, the mathematical forms of admission rates and bed occupancy rate is deduced for each department of the hospital. Taking the maximization of both rates as objectives, the BS-MOCLPSO generates a set of non-dominated optimal allocation decisions for the hospital manager to select. The proposed algorithm introduces a novel binary search-based representation scheme, which transforms a particle's position into a feasible allocation scheme through binary search. Simulation results on real hospital data show that the proposed algorithm can offer allocation decisions that lead to higher service level and better resource utilization.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641804","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1088","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05641804.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization with a binary search-based representation scheme for bed allocation problem in general hospital","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641804/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization with a binary search-based representation scheme for bed allocation problem in general hospital","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641804/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11665014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization with a binary search-based representation scheme for bed allocation problem in general hospital","confLoc":"Istanbul","sourcePdf":"162SMC454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082206S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5641813,"authors":[{"name":"Tarek Aboueldahab","affiliation":["Cairo Metro Company, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Aboueldahab","id":"37597226400"},{"name":"Mahumod Fakhreldin","affiliation":["Computers and Systems Department, Electronic Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mahumod","lastName":"Fakhreldin","id":"37597713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5641813","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Adaptation model","Radio access networks","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","backpropagation","neural net architecture","nonlinear dynamical systems","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","dynamic nonlinear systems","Sigmoid diagonal recurrent neural network","neural network architecture","nonlinear dynamical systems","sigmoid weight victor","sigmoid function","dynamic back propagation learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sigmoid Diagonal Recurrent Neural Networks","dynamic back propagation","dynamic nonlinear systems","adaptive control"]}],"abstract":"The goal of this paper is to introduce a new neural network architecture called Sigmoid Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network (SDRNN) to be used in the adaptive control of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Simulations on dynamic system identification verify the performance of IRT2FNN with clean and noisy outputs as well.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641840","startPage":"733","endPage":"737","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05641840.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Internal/Interconnection Recurrent Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (IRT2FNN) for dynamic system identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641840/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Internal/Interconnection Recurrent Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (IRT2FNN) for dynamic system identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641840/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664554","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Internal/Interconnection Recurrent Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (IRT2FNN) for dynamic system identification","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"111SMC396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078825S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5641843,"authors":[{"name":"Viviana Cocco Mariani","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering PPGEM, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Viviana Cocco","lastName":"Mariani","id":"37593034900"},{"name":"Vagner Jorge Neckel","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering PPGEM, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Vagner Jorge","lastName":"Neckel","id":"37597826700"},{"name":"Rafael Bartnik Grebogi","affiliation":["PPGEM, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rafael Bartnik","lastName":"Grebogi","id":"37597825000"},{"name":"Leandro dos Santos Coelho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering PPGEM, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leandro dos Santos","lastName":"Coelho","id":"37545116400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5641843","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Adaptation model","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heat transfer","inertial systems","inverse problems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","dynamic adaptation","inverse heat transfer problem","swarm intelligence method","optimization problem","animal social behavior","Cauchy distribution","inertia factor","variable estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","optimization","swarm intelligence","inverse problem","heat transfer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641843","abstract":"The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a member of the wide category of swarm intelligence methods for solving global optimization problems.

using genetic algorithm based PCNN method","abstract":"Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) has gained widely attention in image noise reduction as a non-linear filtering technique. Conventional PCNN-based methods usually are combined with median filter or step-by-step modifying algorithm. There are mainly two problems. In one hand, such filtering approaches blur the edge when smoothing an image. In the other hand, it is difficult to properly estimate the parameters of PCNN. Consequently, this paper presents an adaptive genetic algorithm based PCNN method (GA-PCNN) to restrain from additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Different from conventional PCNN-based methods, GA-PCNN utilizes an anisotropic diffusion filter to replace the median filter and optimizes the parameters of a simplified PCNN by means of adaptive genetic algorithm. Experimental results indicate that GA-PCNN has a better performance than the previous denoising techniques, i.e., median filter, Wiener filter, anisotropic diffusion filter, and the conventional PCNN based methods. Conclusions on the effectiveness of Gaussian noise reduction and edge preservation are carried out finally. Furthermore, the results will contribute de-noising in CMOS image sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641902/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664644","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641902/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction using genetic algorithm based PCNN method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction using genetic algorithm based PCNN method","confLoc":"Istanbul","sourcePdf":"399SMC575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057676S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5641920,"authors":[{"name":"David Portugal","affiliation":["Instituto de Sistemas e Rob\u00f3tica, Department of Electrical and Compo Eng, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Portugal","id":"37597160000"},{"name":"Carlos Henggeler Antunes","affiliation":["INESC Coimbra, Department of Electrical and Compo Eng, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Carlos Henggeler","lastName":"Antunes","id":"38179864700"},{"name":"Rui Rocha","affiliation":["Instituto de Sistemas e Rob\u00f3tica, Department of Electrical and Compo Eng, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Rocha","id":"37542076700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5641920","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641920","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","directed graphs","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","longest path approximation","generic undirected graph","NP-complete problem","crossover mechanism","mutation mechanism","robotics","packet network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","Graph Theory","Longest Path Problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641920","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05641920.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2539","endPage":"2544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of genetic algorithms for approximating the longest path in generic graphs","abstract":"Finding the longest simple path in a generic undirected graph is a challenging issue that belongs to the NP-Complete class of problems.

Simulation experiments have been carried out to validate the distinct approaches, which reveal their good performance and provide hints for their application in robotics, packet networks and other fields.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641920/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664660","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641920/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study of genetic algorithms for approximating the longest path in generic graphs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of genetic algorithms for approximating the longest path in generic graphs","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"387SMC82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055133S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5641925,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuaki Masuda","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kanagawa University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuaki","lastName":"Masuda","id":"37272098900"},{"name":"Kenzo Kurihara","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kanagawa University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenzo","lastName":"Kurihara","id":"37285471300"},{"name":"Eitaro Aiyoshi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Eitaro","lastName":"Aiyoshi","id":"37280213400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5641925","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","constraint theory","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["penalty approach","inequality constraint handling","particle swarm optimization","nonlinear optimization problem","problem solving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonlinear programming","constraint handling","penalty method","particle swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5641925","abstract":"This paper proposes a penalty method for solving nonlinear optimization problems with inequalities by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

From the tracked path, features can be extracted such as the relation with the shopping area, the orientation of the head, speed of walking and direction, pauses which are supposed to be related to the interest of the shopper. Once the interest has been detected the next step is to assess the shopper's positive or negative appreciation to the focused products by analyzing the (non-verbal) behavior of the shopper. Ultimately the system goal is to assess the opportunities for selling, by detecting if a customer needs support. In this paper we present our methodology towards developing such a system consisting of participating observation, designing shopping behavioral models, assessing the associated features and analyzing the underlying technology. In order to validate our observations we made recordings in our shop lab.

For this class of systems, traditional safety assuring methods are not satisfying due to the unknown effects of the interacting system with an open environment. Briefly speaking: What is not known during the development phase, can not be adequately considered. In order to realize a more flexible safety analysis, the internal representation of the outside world to be learned by an autonomous Cognitive Technical System, is used to identify hazardous situations. The so-called safety principles represent the hazard knowledge. These can be added to the system prior to operating time without losing the possibility of adjusting or expanding this hazard knowledge during operating time. This contribution details a new method for safety assurance and therefore proposes the introduction of so-called safety principles. Furthermore, the Cognitive Technical System provides anticipation capabilities, so that is becomes possible to expand the planning process in order to take hazard information into account. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates how the autonomous system determines possible future actions, evaluating them with regard to hazards in order to provide a plan with acceptable risk. Nevertheless, the approach can also be implemented to real world applications since typical real world phenomena as uncertainty and faults can also be considered in the chosen virtual world figuratively.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641937","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05641937.pdf","startPage":"2465","endPage":"2472","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action planning for autonomous systems with respect to safety aspects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Action planning for autonomous systems with respect to safety aspects","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11664712","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5641937/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action planning for autonomous systems with respect to safety aspects","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"376SMC489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058918S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5641970,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed approach consists of two stages of strategies. The first stage is for data preprocessing and a support vector regression is used to filter out outliers. Then, the training data set except for outliers, called as the reduced training data set, is directly used in training the non-robust least squares support vector machines for regression (LS-SVMR) for MIMO system in the second stage. Consequently, the learning mechanism of the proposed approach is much easier than the weighted LS-SVMR approach. Based on the simulation results, the performance of the proposed approach with non-robust LS-SVMR is superior to the weighted LS-SVMR approach for MIMO system when the outliers

workflow scheduling for large scale Utility Management Systems","abstract":"Grid computing is the future computing paradigm for enterprise applications. It can be used for executing large scale workflow applications. This paper focuses on the workflow scheduling mechanism. Although there is much work on static scheduling approaches for workflow applications in parallel environments, little work has been done on a Grid environment for industrial systems. Utility Management Systems (UMS) are executing very large numbers of workflows with very high resource requirements. Unlike the grid approach for standard scientific workflows, UMS workflows have a different set of requirements and thereby optimization of resource usage has to be made in a different way. This paper proposes a novel scheduling architecture which dynamically executes a scheduling algorithm using near real-time feedback from the execution monitor. An Artificial Neural Network was used for workflow scheduling and performance tests show that significant improvement of overall execution time can be achieved by this soft-computing method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5641990/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11665064","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5641990/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network workflow scheduling for large scale Utility Management Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network workflow scheduling for large scale Utility Management Systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"351SMC817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059619S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5641990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5642026,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xiaolong Zhang","id":"37087593103"},{"name":"Na Zeng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Na Zeng","id":"37087751522"},{"name":"J Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Tang","id":"37402549600"},{"name":"Xin Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xin Xu","id":"37087199615"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642026","dbTime":"120 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["XML","Information filters","Monitoring","Browsers","Irrigation","Google"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information filters","Internet","Web sites","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web user behavior monitoring","campus networks","filtering systems","unhealthy web contents","Internet behavior monitoring method","unhealthy websites","XML documents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BHO","Internet behavior monitoring","socket communication","XML"]}],"abstract":"The widespread networks in campus provide students with rich resources, but they also provide unhealthy information which may have negative effects on students. Filtering systems have been developed to prevent web users from unhealthy web contents. However, the false positive and false negative rates of those tools are still high and thus need to be improved. In this paper, we propose an Internet behavior monitoring method by integrating the BHO plug-in techniques with URL-based filtering technique, and apply this method in the campus network.

Certainly, the impact on the computational power of such a parallel computer system is related to the inherent parallelism of the algorithm to be implemented. The implementation of an algorithm onto a parallel computer architecture, requires from the developers a good knowledge of the underlying hardware in order to exploit the effect of the parallelization most beneficial. In order to hide as good as possible the complexity of the hardware from the developers, novel programming languages for parallel computers were developed. For example the programming models CUDA, OpenMP, OpenCL, Open GL and MPI are targeting novel multiprocessor system-on-chip architectures like the Intel Single Chip Cloud Computer with 48 cores or the Nvidia Tesla processors with hundreds of processor cores. If a new hardware architecture is invented and developed, it is always beneficial to follow standards in programming models in order to keep a compatibility to already developed programs. A novel runtime adaptive multiprocessor system-on-chip is the RAMPSoC. RAMPSoC combines the benefits of multiprocessors and reconfigurable hardware in one system and is therefore of high importance for future system design. In order to align the RAMPSoC approach to current standards, a support for Message Passing Interface (MPI) was included recently. This important step allows now to re-use already existing source code written with MPI extensions on a runtime adaptive platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642043/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11664401","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Message Passing Interface support for the runtime adaptive multi-processor system-on-chip RAMPSoC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message Passing Interface support for the runtime adaptive multi-processor system-on-chip RAMPSoC","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"011357PaperSamosCodePagePaperAllTogetherSamos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079238S","chronDate":"19-22 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628951","isNumber":"5642040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628951","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5642040","articleId":"5642043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5642046,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Falcao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f6es/FCTUC, Universidade de Coimbra P\u00f3lo II, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Falcao","id":"37394052900"},{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IST/INESC-ID/TU Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37265872100"},{"name":"Vitor Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f6es/FCTUC, Universidade de Coimbra P\u00f3lo II, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Vitor","lastName":"Silva","id":"37287128100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7938-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7936-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5642046","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded multicore architectures for LDPC decoding","abstract":"Recently, the development of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoding solutions has been proposed for a vast set of architectures, ranging from dedicated hardware to fully programmable ones (e.g. Cell/B.E. and graphics processing units). In this paper we propose efficient embedded programmable multicore architectures for achieving real-time LDPC decoding. The proposed multicore architectures allow to exploit data parallelism by decoding in parallel multiple codewords on the provided cores, with enough local memory capacity to store all data corresponding to the Tanner graph. Therefore, with this distributed memory and local computing approach, only a single shared bus is required to communicate the codewords. The proposed class of architectures can be prototyped on field programmable gate arrays or implemented on application specific integrated circuits, and it is validated by using the popular Cell processor, which relates very closely with the one here proposed. Finally, we discuss the related art of dedicated and programmable LDPC decoders, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages regarding the proposed solution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Expensive equalization techniques are needed to recover the transmitted signal. The Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) equalizer is a sub-optimal equalizer that is a good compromise between computational complexity and communication system performance. It uses computationally-intensive matrix inversion operations to perform equalization. In this paper, we address the computational challenges of implementing the LMMSE equalizer on Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. SDR platforms are favored by the wireless industry due to their significant benefits of reduced development costs and accelerated time-to-market.

A 2\u00d72 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system with 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) is assumed. The chosen level update vector for SSFE is based on computer simulation results carried out in MATLAB environment. We implemented the algorithms with Nvidia Quadro FX 1700 GPU and achieved a throughput of 36.06 Mbps for SSFE and 16.8 Mbps for LORD. The results show that the general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) has the potential to achieve high throughput, presuming a detection algorithm that allows efficient parallel processing. The latency of the control code and partial Euclidean distance (PED) calculations are very small-scale, but the latency of memory loads and stores to the GPUs global memory are significant. We also compare results from the trellis based detector implementation for GPU, where a more powerful GPU and a different detection algorithm are used. The GPUs offer superior computing power and programmability compared to the application specific software defined radio (SDR) designs implemented so far.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642054","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628951/5642040/05642054.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU implementation for two MIMO-OFDM detectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A GPU implementation for two MIMO-OFDM detectors","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642054/","accessionNumber":"11664368","publicationDate":"July 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU implementation for two MIMO-OFDM detectors","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"011293PaperSamosCodePagePaperAllTogetherSamos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149745S","chronDate":"19-22 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628951","isNumber":"5642040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628951","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5642040","articleId":"5642054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5642061,"authors":[{"name":"Pekka O.

The OpenCL compiler is given the explicit freedom to parallelize the execution of kernel instances at all the levels of parallelism. In comparison to the traditional C programming language which is sequential in nature, OpenCL enables higher utilization of parallelism naturally available in hardware constructs while still having a feasible learning curve for engineers familiar with the C language. This paper describes methodology and compiler techniques involved in applying OpenCL as an input language for a design flow of application-specific processors. At the core of the methodology is a whole program optimizing compiler that links together the host and kernel codes of the input OpenCL program and parallelizes the result on a customized statically scheduled processor. The OpenCL vendor extension mechanism is used to provide clean access to custom operations. The methodology is studied with a design case to verify the scalability of the implementation at the instruction level and to exemplify the use of custom operations. The case shows that the use of OpenCL allows producing scalable application-specific processor designs and makes it possible to gradually reach the performance of hand-tailored RTL designs by exploiting the OpenCL extension mechanism to access custom hardware operations of varying complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642061","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628951/5642040/05642061.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenCL-based design methodology for application-specific processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"OpenCL-based design methodology for application-specific processors","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642061/","accessionNumber":"11664371","publicationDate":"July 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenCL-based design methodology for application-specific processors","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"011223PaperSamosCodePagePaperAllTogetherSamos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104202S","chronDate":"19-22 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628951","isNumber":"5642040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628951","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5642040","articleId":"5642061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5642064,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Huthmann","affiliation":["Embedded Systems and Applications Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Huthmann","id":"37596046600"},{"name":"Peter M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Embedded Systems and Applications Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37592328300"},{"name":"Florian Stock","affiliation":["Embedded Systems and Applications Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Stock","id":"37299153000"},{"name":"Dietmar Hildenbrand","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Hildenbrand","id":"37549507900"},{"name":"Andreas Koch","affiliation":["Embedded Systems and Applications Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Koch","id":"37274057500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7938-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7936-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5642064","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Hardware","Algebra","Blades","Clocks","Optimization","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","program compilers","reconfigurable architectures","symbol manipulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic compilation","geometric algebra","GPU","low power reconfigurable accelerator","optimization technique","embedded computing","hardware optimization techniques","high-performance embedded computing"]}],"abstract":"Geometric Algebra (GA), a generalization of quaternions, is a very powerful form for intuitively expressing and manipulating complex geometric relationships common to engineering problems. The actual evaluation of GA expressions, though, is extremely compute intensive due to the high-dimensionality of data being processed. On standard desktop CPUs, GA evaluations take considerably longer than conventional mathematical formulations. GPUs do offer sufficient throughput to make the use of concise GA formulations practical, but require power far exceeding the budgets for most embedded applications. While the suitability of low-power reconfigurable accelerators for evaluating specific GA computations has already been demonstrated, these often required a significant manual design effort.

Our techniques are based on a novel two-actor SDF graph Model (TASM), which efficiently captures the behavior and costs associated with SDF graph edges (flow-graph connections). With our proposed techniques, designers can automatically generate upper bounds on SDF graph buffer distributions that realize maximum achievable throughput performance for the corresponding applications.

Dense disparity estimation is performed using the non-parametric rank transform and semi-global matching (SGM), which is among the top performing stereo matching methods and outperforms locally-based methods in terms of quality of disparity maps and robustness under difficult imaging conditions. Stream-based processing of the SGM despite its non-scan-aligned, complex data dependencies is achieved by a scalable, systolic-array-based architecture. This architecture fulfills the demands of real-world applications regarding frame rate, depth resolution and low resource usage. The architecture is based on a novel two-dimensional parallelization concept for the SGM. An FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-5 generates disparity maps of VGA images (640\u00d7480 pixel) with a 128 pixel disparity range under real-time conditions (30 fps) at a clock frequency as low as 39 MHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Estimation","Stereo vision","Hardware","Computer architecture","Interpolation","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image matching","stereo image processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time stereo vision system","semiglobal matching disparity estimation","FPGA-implementation","noise reduction","noise rectification","disparity estimation","visualization","nonparametric rank transform","disparity maps","stream-based processing","complex data dependencies","systolic array based architecture","frame rate","depth resolution","low resource usage","two-dimensional parallelization concept","Xilinx Virtex-5","stereo matching methods","frequency 39 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642077","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642077","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628951/5642040/05642077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642077","startPage":"93","endPage":"101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642040","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time stereo vision system using semi-global matching disparity estimation: Architecture and FPGA-implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time stereo vision system using semi-global matching disparity estimation: Architecture and FPGA-implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642077/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 July 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 July 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642077/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11664387","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time stereo vision system using semi-global matching disparity estimation: Architecture and FPGA-implementation","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"011093PaperSamosCodePagePaperAllTogetherSamos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084658S","chronDate":"19-22 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628951","isNumber":"5642040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628951","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5642040","articleId":"5642077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5642095,"authors":[{"name":"Taj Muhammad Khan","affiliation":["INRIA Saclay, Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Taj Muhammad","lastName":"Khan","id":"38258861900"},{"name":"Daniel Gracia P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["CEA, LIST, Software Safety Laboratory, Gif-sur-Yvette CEDEX, France"],"firstName":"Daniel Gracia","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37560706700"},{"name":"Olivier Temam","affiliation":["INRIA Saclay, Saclay, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Temam","id":"37282483400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7938-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7936-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5642095","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642095","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Accuracy","Adaptation model","Measurement","Computational efficiency","Benchmark testing","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling methods","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent sampling","low simulation speeds","fast simulation technique","high simulation speed","state-of- the-art sampling techniques","orthogonal issue","warm up technique","cumbersome simulator modification","user friendly technique"]}],"abstract":"Low simulation speeds have a critical impact on the design process by limiting the number of design options which can be explored.

In order to support emerging services, it is clear that a higher degree of monitoring functionality is needed within networks. One approach is to use the programmability and performance of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to allow distributed monitoring but this present challenges around memory usage and highlights the need for a strategically different approach to how flows are monitored. A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time. The monitor has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 based ML506 board and verified in hardware using real Internet traffic traces. The platform allowed us to experiment with various monitoring functions and establish their resource requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628951/5642040/05642096.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a flexible high-speed FPGA-based flow monitor for next generation networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","IP networks","Next generation networking","Protocols","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Internet","IP networks","logic design","monitoring","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based programmable IP flow monitor","next generation network","field programmable gate array technology","Packet Xpress","Xilinx Virtex-5","ML506 board","real Internet traffic tracing","flexible high speed FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high level design","telecomms monitoring","FPGAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of a flexible high-speed FPGA-based flow monitor for next generation networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642096/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11664396","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a flexible high-speed FPGA-based flow monitor for next generation networks","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"011037PaperSamosCodePagePaperAllTogetherSamos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088922S","chronDate":"19-22 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628951","isNumber":"5642040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628951","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5642040","articleId":"5642096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5642168,"authors":[{"name":"Ario Loeve","affiliation":["He is currently working on his Ph.D. degree and is developing a new, shaft-guided colonoscope, aiming to develop means for pain-free, easy, and cheap colonoscopy."],"bio":{"p":["Arjo Loeve received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mechanical engineering from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.

In this paper, a new and general approach for combinatorial optimization is proposed using the Differential Evolution algorithm. The proposed approach aims at preserving its interesting search mechanism for discrete domains, by defining the difference between two candidate solutions as a differential list of movements in the search space. Thus, a more meaningful and general differential mutation operator for the context of combinatorial optimization problems can be produced. We discuss three alternatives for using the differential list of movements within the differential mutation operation.

Following to above mentioned target, two neuro-fuzzy classification algorithms incorporated with two artificial neural networks classifiers selected. They put under test to investigate their ability to recognize Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) from ECG signals. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Locally Linear Model Tree (LOLIMOT), are two neuro-fuzzy networks used in the test. They have good capability of learning. Also Multi layer Perceptron (MLP) and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) used as well in test. These are four structures totally used in this paper. The ECG sampled signals are taken from MIT-BIH database. They are used to train neural networks enabling them to classify Ischemia. All neuro-structures have been tested by using experimental ECG records of individuals. The results suggest that neuro-fuzzy classifiers perform better than the other types of classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642196/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664605","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642196/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of neuro-fuzzy approaches with artificial neural networks for the detection of Ischemia in ECG signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of neuro-fuzzy approaches with artificial neural networks for the detection of Ischemia in ECG signals","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"621SMC887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072112S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5642208,"authors":[{"name":"Fatima Ghedjati","affiliation":["CReSTIC-URCA, Reims, France"],"firstName":"Fatima","lastName":"Ghedjati","id":"37596057000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642208","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642208","abstract":"In this paper we address a generalized job-shop scheduling problem with unrelated parallel machines and precedence constraints between the jobs operations (corresponding to either linear or non linear process routings).

Such arrangement is typical for instance in the case of pipeline monitoring. The focus in this work is restricted to the Amplify-and-Forward (AF) protocol at the relay sensor node where a proper lightweight combining strategy is considered at the receiver. A linear 3-node arrangement of WSN network is considered in the simulation. Substantial gain was observable upon deploying our cooperative scheme. It is evident that the distance between sensor nodes plays a role in dictating the overall system performance. Though they both fall under the same paradigm, there can be a remarkable difference between a fully-cooperative and a partially-cooperative relay node. This motivated us to introduce the reliability of cooperation for the relay sensor node, and study its impact on the system performance. Simulation results make it clear that the cooperation reliability of the relay node can excruciately impact the system performance. Proper measure needs to be taken to account for this vulnerability in the cooperative scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642216","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642216.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"112","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward cooperative relaying for a linear Wireless Sensor Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward cooperative relaying for a linear Wireless Sensor Network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642216/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664661","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642216/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward cooperative relaying for a linear Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"017SMC728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058587S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5642231,"authors":[{"name":"Chiu-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiu-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600144700"},{"name":"Tung-Kuan Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tung-Kuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280957900"},{"name":"Jyh-Horng Chou","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyh-Horng","lastName":"Chou","id":"37274488800"},{"name":"Hsiu Wang","affiliation":["Educational Network Center of Kaohsiung County, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsiu Wang","id":"37599262200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642231","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642231","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","education","genetic algorithms","greedy algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","teacher volunteer transferring program","Taiwan","public elementary schools","NP-hard rostering operation","greedy-search mutation operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["volunteer transferring","rostering","greedy search","genetic algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642231","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642231.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of genetic algorithms to teacher volunteer transferring problems","abstract":"Teacher volunteer transferring program (TVTP) in Taiwan provides transferring chances for the teachers serving in public elementary schools. The kernel flow of TVTP involves a special NP-hard rostering operation. That is, an exhausted search for exploring the whole transferring cases is impossible while the practical problem size is not small. Therefore, current Taiwan TVTP adopts deterministically heuristics rules to arrange the transferring plans. However, due to the limited results, this paper proposes a new approach which adopts the genetic algorithms hybridized with a greedy-search mutation operator to serve as a global solver. The positive results show that the application based on the proposed approach can obtain up-to 33% improvements compared to official published data. In additional, it also has great scalability to provide a quite good solution even in a larger problem size, for example, more than nine hundred teachers joined in a practical transferring program.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642231/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664673","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642231/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic algorithms to teacher volunteer transferring problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic algorithms to teacher volunteer transferring problems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"030SMC334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061967S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5642240,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this research the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for joint channel estimation and multi-user detection. For improving exploration and exploitation strengths of GA, a GA-based approach called SAM-GA is developed by incorporating the simulated annealing (SA) to mutation operation. Furthermore, a threshold-based mutation is proposed to refine the SAM-GA scheme. The resulting scheme is called modified SAM-GA for simplicity. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed modified SAM-GA scheme achieves the best performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), and convergence rate for joint CIR

To realize such an optimization, its distribution network requires solving several tens to hundreds (maximum 2 thousands or so) cities Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) within interactive response time (around 3 seconds) with expert-level accuracy (below 3% level of error rate). To meet these requirements, an Inner Random Restart Genetic Algorithm (Irr-GA) method is proposed. This method combines random restart and GA that has different types of simple heuristics such as 2-opt and NI (Nearest Insertion). Including these heuristics, field experts and field engineers can easily understand the way and use it.

In this article a modified version of IWO has been used for training the feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. It has been found that modified IWO performs better than another very competitive real parameter optimizer called Differential Evolution (DE) and a few classical gradient-based optimization algorithms in context to the weight training of feed-forward ANNs in terms of learning rate and solution quality.

fuzzy controller for an nth order multi input multi output (MIMO) nonlinear systems suffering from model uncertainties and subjected to external perturbation. To overcome the constraint on the knowledge of the system model, local models related to some operating points were used to synthesize a type-2 nominal fuzzy model. For sliding modes, adaptive fuzzy type-2 systems have been introduced to generate the super twisting signals to avoid both the chattering and the constraint on the knowledge of upper bounds disturbances and uncertainties. These adaptive fuzzy type-2 systems are adjusted on-line by adaptation laws deduced from the stability analysis in Lyapunov sense. Many simulation results for two link robot manipulator are given to illustrate the good tracking performances, the robustness of the closed loop system and smooth signal control obtained by the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642289","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642289.pdf","startPage":"1812","endPage":"1820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO second order sliding mode fuzzy type-2 control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642289/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO second order sliding mode fuzzy type-2 control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664799","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642289/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO second order sliding mode fuzzy type-2 control","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"276SMC515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064971S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5642311,"authors":[{"name":"Kashif Iqbal","affiliation":["Department of Computing and the Digital Environment, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Iqbal","id":"37285898300"},{"name":"Michael Odetayo","affiliation":["Department of Computing and the Digital Environment, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Odetayo","id":"37329465400"},{"name":"Anne James","affiliation":["Department of Computing and the Digital Environment, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"James","id":"37266252300"},{"name":"Rosalina Abdul Salam","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Rosalina Abdul Salam","id":"37321105400"},{"name":"Abdullah Zawawi Hj Talib","affiliation":["School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Penang, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Abdullah Zawawi Hj Talib","id":"37085950271"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642311","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1688},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image enhancement","oceanographic techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised colour correction method","underwater image enhancement","RGB colour","image processing","contrast correction method","HSI colour model","colour balancing","gray world","white patch","histogram equalisation","Adobe Photoshop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contrast Correction","Image Enhancement","Colour Balancing","Colour Cast Correction"]}],"abstract":"Underwater images are affected by reduced contrast and non-uniform colour cast due to the absorption and scattering of light in the aquatic environment. This affects the quality and reliability of image processing and therefore colour correction is a necessary pre-processing stage. In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Colour Correction Method (UCM) for underwater image enhancement. UCM is based on colour balancing, contrast correction of RGB colour model and contrast correction of HSI colour model. Firstly, the colour cast is reduced by equalizing the colour values. Secondly, an enhancement to a contrast correction method is applied to increase the Red colour by stretching red histogram towards the maximum (i.e., right side), similarly the Blue colour is reduced by stretching the blue histogram towards the minimum (i.e., left side). Thirdly, the Saturation and Intensity components of the HSI colour model have been applied for contrast correction to increase the true colour using Saturation and to address the illumination problem through Intensity. We compare our results with three well known methods, namely Gray World, White Patch and Histogram Equalisation using Adobe Photoshop. The proposed method has produced better results than the existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642311","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642311.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the low quality images using Unsupervised Colour Correction Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642311/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the low quality images using Unsupervised Colour Correction Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664820","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642311/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the low quality images using Unsupervised Colour Correction Method","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"261SMC731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056457S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5642350,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407402500"},{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404871800"},{"name":"Shuning Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuning","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280449400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642350","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Programming","Optimization","Integrated circuits","Approximation methods","Refrigerants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","linear programming","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCP operation optimization","centrifugal chiller plant","continuous piecewise linear programming","CCP","air conditioning system","environmental protection","large-scale nonlinear problem","CWLP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["operation optimization","continuous piecewise linear modeling","nonlinear programming","centrifugal chiller plants"]}],"abstract":"Centrifugal chiller plants (CCP) are widely used in air conditioning systems, its operation optimization can save lots of energy and has great significance in environmental protection.

The VHDL is utilized to program FPGA as the firmware controller. In our implementation, CMAC is used as the learning mechanism because of its quick learning capability, and it can learn the perfect control law of the supervisory control system.

Radial basis function uses curve fitting mode to obtain the nonlinear mapping. The unavoidable learning procedure degrades its transient performance in the existence of disturbance. Sliding-mode control is effective in overcoming uncertainties and has a fast transient response, while the control effort is discontinuous and creates chattering. For this defect, a saturation function is utilized to improve it.

This new descriptor called Local Adaptive Ternary Pattern (LATP) is based on the Local Ternary Pattern (LTP). Unlike the previous techniques, this new descriptor determines the local pattern threshold automatically using local statistics. It shares with LTP the property of being less sensitive to noise, illumination change and facial expressions. These characteristics make it a good candidate for multispectral face recognition. Linear and non linear subspace learning and recognition techniques are introduced and used for performance evaluation of face recognition in the new texture space: PCA, LDA, Kernel-PCA (KPCA), Kernel-LDA (KDA), Linear Graph Embedding (LGE), Kernel-LGE (KLGE), Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) and Kernel-LPP (KLPP). The obtained results show an increase in recognition performance when texture features are used. LTP and LATP are the best performing techniques. The overall best performance is obtained in the short wave infrared spectrum (SWIR) using the new proposed technique combined with a non linear subspace learning technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642391.pdf","startPage":"3308","endPage":"3314","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally adaptive texture features for multispectral face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image texture","infrared spectra","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally adaptive texture feature","multispectral face recognition","local adaptive ternary pattern","local pattern threshold","local statistics","facial expression","non linear subspace learning","performance evaluation","LDA","Kernel PCA","linear graph embedding","locality preserving projection","short wave infrared spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","texture analysis","subspace learning","features extraction","multispctral imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Locally adaptive texture features for multispectral face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664896","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally adaptive texture features for multispectral face recognition","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"500SMC249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065701S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5642396,"authors":[{"name":"Amr A.

In the context of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, there are a few attentions to the computational complexity of this kind of algorithms. Here, we aim to reduce number of fitness function evaluations in multiobjective cellular genetic algorithms by the use of fitness granulation via an adaptive fuzzy similarity analysis. In the proposed algorithm, an individual's fitness is only computed if it has insufficient similarity to a queue of fuzzy granules whose fitness has already been computed. If an individual is sufficiently similar to a known fuzzy granule, then that granule's fitness is used instead as a crude estimate. Otherwise, that individual is added to the queue as a new fuzzy granule. The queue size as well as each granule's radius of influence is adaptive and will grow/shrink depending on the population fitness and the number of dissimilar granules. The proposed method is applied to a set of 6 test problems. In comparison with two well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II, and MoCell, computational results show that the proposed method is competitive with these algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642401","startPage":"4147","endPage":"4153","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642401.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective cellular genetic algorithm with adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective cellular genetic algorithm","adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation","computational complexity","evolutionary algorithms","repeated fitness function evaluations","adaptive fuzzy similarity analysis","NSGA-II","MoCell"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective cellular genetic algorithm with adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664907","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective cellular genetic algorithm with adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"638SMC157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068424S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5642414,"authors":[{"name":"Kakin K.

One successful realization is haptic guidance that continuously produces torques on the steering wheel depending on predicted lateral lane deviations. Thus, both driver and support system contribute to the steering wheel torque, sharing lateral control of the vehicle. However, current shared control systems do not support drivers during a lane change, a driving task diametrically opposed to lane keeping. This study describes the design and evaluation of an extension of lane-keeping haptic guidance, which also continuously and smoothly supports lane changes. An experiment in a fixed-base driving simulator was conducted to assess the effect of the support system on lane change behavior when haptic guidance was provided during both lane-keeping and lane-changing situations. In agreement with previous findings, objective measures and subjective responses showed that the presented haptic guidance was beneficial during lane-keeping tasks, resulting in small but significantly increased performance with a smoother and reduced steering activity. Although the developed system increased the measured steering wheel peak torque during the start of lane changes, subjective responses showed that drivers could comfortably make lane changes and felt in control during the maneuver. Concluding, the designed system provides drivers with the benefits of (previously designed) haptic guidance for lane-keeping, while allowing them to smoothly change lanes at any time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11664920","htmlLink":"/document/5642414/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Balancing safety and support: Changing lanes with a haptic lane-keeping support system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing safety and support: Changing lanes with a haptic lane-keeping support system","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"186SMC261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058787S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5642443,"authors":[{"name":"Szu-Yin Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Information Management, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Szu-Yin Lin","id":"37087167571"},{"name":"Kuo-Ming Chao","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Engineering, Coventry University, Coventry, UK"],"lastName":"Kuo-Ming Chao","id":"37087168675"},{"name":"Chi-Chun Lo","affiliation":["Institute of Information Management, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Chun Lo","id":"37087166963"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642443","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642443","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Cities and towns","Vehicles","Global Positioning System","Smart phones","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","control engineering computing","road traffic","traffic engineering computing","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic data driven application systems","dynamic traffic signal control","intelligent transportation systems","traffic congestion problem","service-oriented architecture","Web services technology","decentralized traffic signal control system","distributed data-driven optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Services","Service-Oriented Architecture","Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems","Dynamic Traffic Signal Control"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic traffic signal control in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has been widely developed in major cities' urban areas around the world to provide more efficient way for solving traffic congestion problem.

One of the challenging optimization problems in which GA has been extensively applied is feature selection. It aims at finding an optimal small size subset of features from the original large feature set. It has been found that the main limitation of the traditional GA-based feature selection is that it tends to get trapped in local minima, a problem known as premature convergence. A number of implementations are presented in the literature to overcome this problem based on fitness scaling, genetic operator modification, boosting genetic population diversity, etc. This paper presents a new modified genetic algorithm based on enhanced population diversity, parents' selection and improved genetic operators. Practical results indicate the significance of the proposed GA variant in comparison to many other algorithms from the literature on different datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642445","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629466/5641665/05642445.pdf","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1331","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5641665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the diversity of genetic algorithm for improved feature selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the diversity of genetic algorithm for improved feature selection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11664950","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642445/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the diversity of genetic algorithm for improved feature selection","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"201SMC946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055017S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629466","isNumber":"5641665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629466","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5641665","articleId":"5642445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5642452,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278409600"},{"name":"Ming-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Hung Lin","id":"37597012900"},{"name":"Hsin-Yi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Yi Li","id":"37600687700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6586-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6587-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5642452","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","H\u221e control","learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H\u221e robust performance","adaptive wavelet cerebellar-model-articulation-controller design","MIMO nonlinear systems","multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems","PSO algorithm","three-link robotic arm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet","CMAC","H\u221e control","PSO","robotic arm"]}],"abstract":"This study proposes an adaptive wavelet cerebellar -model-articulation-controller (AWCMAC) for multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems.

From the synthesis results, we find that the proposed design involves comparable delay, but requires less than one-fourth of the area and area-delay complexity compared with the existing LUT-based implementations.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642617","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629484/5642591/05642617.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642591","startPage":"91","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimized lookup-table for the evaluation of sigmoid function for artificial neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An optimized lookup-table for the evaluation of sigmoid function for artificial neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642617/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11665313","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642617/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimized lookup-table for the evaluation of sigmoid function for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp17011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043468S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629484","isNumber":"5642591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629484","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5642591","articleId":"5642617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5642619,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In this type of devices other transient faults tend to dominate over SEUs, especially when the device operates at high frequency. In this scenario, it is expected that Single Event Transient (SET) faults will predominate. As a result, designers will still need prediction techniques to forecast the effects of ionizing radiation in their designs. Although radiation testing is a feasible method for evaluating circuit sensitiveness against SETs, it is hard to implement, very expensive, and it can be used only in later phases of the design process, when a prototype of the system is available. On the other hand, simulation techniques need a first technology characterization step and also require a very detailed model for being effective; moreover they are application dependent. In this paper we propose a new software tool for analyzing designs implemented in Flash-based FPGAs and estimating SET sensitiveness. The evaluation process is static, as it does not entail any simulation. In particular, it provides worst-case results, thus being intrinsically more conservative than other dynamic methods. Experimental results are presented comparing the ones coming from radiation testing and the results provided by the presented tool. They validate the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new software tool for static analysis of SET sensitiveness in Flash-based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642619","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642591","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629484/5642591/05642619.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new software tool for static analysis of SET sensitiveness in Flash-based FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642619/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11665315","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new software tool for static analysis of SET sensitiveness in Flash-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp15113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053409S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629484","isNumber":"5642591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5642591","articleId":"5642619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5642621,"authors":[{"name":"Shoichi Nishida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoichi","lastName":"Nishida","id":"37601235300"},{"name":"Jyunya Eto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Jyunya","lastName":"Eto","id":"37601759400"},{"name":"Motoki Amagasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoki","lastName":"Amagasaki","id":"37295778700"},{"name":"Masahiro Iida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Iida","id":"37290518600"},{"name":"Morihiro Kuga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Morihiro","lastName":"Kuga","id":"37603417800"},{"name":"Toshinori Sueyoshi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Sueyoshi","id":"37302132800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6471-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6469-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6470-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"5642621","dbTime":"76 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Delay","Clustering algorithms","Wire","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","field programmable gate arrays","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-aware FPGA routing fabrics","field-programmable gate arrays","power consumption","electronic design automation tools","clustering algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642621","abstract":"The performance of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has been significantly improved due to a new process technology. However, several problems have arisen in the new generation FPGAs. Specifically, the issue of power consumption is a serious issue, because FPGAs have many routing resources. We report on the improvement of both the FPGA routing structure and electronic design automation (EDA) tools in order to solve this issue. In order to reduce the power consumption, high activity nets are assigned to low load lines, which is the routing structure used for small-world networks in FPGAs. In addition, the clustering and routing algorithms of the EDA tools are improved to complement the routing structure. This report demonstrates that the power can be reduced. Based on evaluation results, a maximum power consumption improvement of 48.4% was obtained, and the average improvement was 22.9% when using the proposed routing structure and EDA tools.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642621","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629484/5642591/05642621.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-aware FPGA routing fabrics and design tools","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power-aware FPGA routing fabrics and design tools","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642621/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11665318","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-aware FPGA routing fabrics and design tools","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp13056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074385S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629484","isNumber":"5642591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629484","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5642591","articleId":"5642621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5642625,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Meloni","affiliation":["Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Meloni","id":"37299748200"},{"name":"Simone Secchi","affiliation":["Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Secchi","id":"37393250400"},{"name":"Luigi Raffo","affiliation":["Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Raffo","id":"37299746700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6471-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6469-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6470-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8432"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8440"}],"articleNumber":"5642625","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Switches","Emulation","Hardware","Runtime","Optical wavelength conversion","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","field programmable gate arrays","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast network-on-chip topology selection","FPGA-based runtime reconfigurable prototyper","modern interconnect architecture design","software cycle-accurate simulators","RTL synthesis-implementation","time overhead","design space points"]}],"abstract":"The complexity of modern interconnect architecture design requires highly accurate and rapid simulation environments.

This paper proposes runtime reconfiguration of the architecture to push the hardware emulation one step further, by reducing the number of FPGA implementation processes to be run. To this aim, this work presents an algorithm that synthesizes, for a set of candidate architectural configurations, a connection topology capable of reconfiguring itself via software to emulate all the design space points under evaluation. We present the actual reconfiguration algorithm, the CAD tools and the hardware mechanisms that implement it.

All test paths must be activated simultaneously without resource conflict. The test packet is built using Maximal Aggressor Fault (MAF) vectors. The test strategy is capable of detecting 100% of the considered faults. The test application time grows quadratically with the NoC increase, but can be drastically improved by means of two alternative approaches also proposed in the paper. Those local approaches are based on simultaneously testing multiple victims or NoC regions unlikely to aggress each other. The test time then grows linearly and shows a very modest derivative.","doi":"10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642677","publicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on VLSI and System-on-Chip","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629484/5642591/05642677.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISOC.2010.5642677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642591","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A broad strategy to detect crosstalk faults in network-on-chip interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A broad strategy to detect crosstalk faults in network-on-chip interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642677/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11665347","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5642677/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broad strategy to detect crosstalk faults in network-on-chip interconnects","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"rp54151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057066S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629484","isNumber":"5642591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629484","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5642591","articleId":"5642677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5642678,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To meet such high volume market needs, a cheap and rapid method for sealing these microfluidic platforms which is viable for mass manufacture is highly desirable. The packaging must protect the system against dirt, humidity, stresses, etc and, depending on the application, provide electrical, fluidic or optical interconnection and thermal management. Most of the existing sealing and interconnecting techniques are cost-intensive and slow compared to the other manufacturing steps of the microfluidic system, so that they form a bottleneck in mass production. Low frequency induction heating (LFIH) has been introduced as potential basis of a cost-effective, rapid production method for polymer microfluidic device sealing in preceding publications. Induction heating is well established in the steel industry for hardening, melting, soldering, welding, and annealing, but increasingly is finding application in other areas like heating fillings in dental medicine, and cap sealing. Through this technique excellent bond strength was achieved, withstanding an air-pressure of up to 590 kPa. However, it has been found that during the bonding process it is important to effectively manage the heat dissipation to prevent distortion of the microfluidic platform. The heat affected zone, and the localised melted area, must be controlled to avoid blockage of the microfluidic channels or altering the channels' wall characteristics. This work sums up the results of experiments, simulations and analytical approaches to provide a basis for process optimisation. The effects of susceptor area and bond parameters like bond pressure and heating time on the heating rate are discussed. Heat affected zone and bond strength of pulse heated samples are compared to those of continuously heated systems and rules for susceptor design are provided. Based on the knowledge gained a microfluidic device is designed and manufactured.","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd Electronics System Integration Technology Conference ESTC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629474/5642799/05642834.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"3rd Electronics System Integration Technology Conference ESTC","doi":"10.1109/ESTC.2010.5642834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTC.2010.5642834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5642834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polymer bonding by induction heating for microfluidic applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Optical films","Connectors","Electron tubes","Optical coupling","Microfluidics","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bonding processes","heating","induction heating","microfluidics","seals (stoppers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polymer bonding","microfluidic applications","microfluidic systems","microfluidic platforms","mass manufacture","optical interconnection","thermal management","sealing techniques","interconnecting techniques","cost-intensive","mass production","low frequency induction heating","LFIH","rapid production method","polymer microfluidic device sealing","steel industry","hardening","melting","soldering","welding","annealing","bond strength","bonding process","heat dissipation","heat affected zone","microfluidic channels","bond parameters","bond pressure","heating time","heating rate","pulse heated samples","susceptor design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5642834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Polymer bonding by induction heating for microfluidic applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5642834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11665108","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polymer bonding by induction heating for microfluidic applications","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p0081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091488S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629474","isNumber":"5642799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5642799","articleId":"5642834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5642874,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The context for load control is established by providing an overview of system control objectives, including economic dispatch, automatic generation control, and spinning reserve. The paper then reviews existing initiatives that seek to develop load control programs for the provision of power system services. We then discuss some of the challenges to achieving a load control scheme that balances device-level objectives with power system-level objectives. One of the central premises of the paper is that, in order to achieve full responsiveness, direct load control (as opposed to price response) is required to enable fast time scale, predictable control opportunities, especially for the provision of ancillary services such as regulation and contingency reserves. Centralized, hierarchical, and distributed control architectures are discussed along with benefits and disadvantages, especially in relation to integration with the legacy power system control architecture. Implications for the supporting communications infrastructure are also considered. Fully responsive load control is illustrated in the context of thermostatically controlled loads and plug-in electric vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2081652","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5669979/05643088.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2081652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Controllability of Electric Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Controllability of Electric Loads","volume":"99","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698374","htmlLink":"/document/5643088/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Controllability of Electric Loads","sourcePdf":"jproc-callaway-2081652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100411S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5669979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"720","xplore-issue":"5669979","articleId":"5643088","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5643091,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Young Oh","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5673672/5643091/5643091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Young Oh received the B.S. degree from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.","From 2003 to 2008, he was with System IC division of LG Electronics, Seoul, Korea, where he led the design team of high-speed interfaces as a chief research engineer.

This paper discusses the different process steps in the UTCP production and also presents the interconnection test results realized with this technology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UTCP: A Novel Polyimide-Based Ultra-Thin Chip Packaging Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","doi":"10.1109/TCAPT.2010.2060198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6144/5673023/05643116.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAPT.2010.2060198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"UTCP: A Novel Polyimide-Based Ultra-Thin Chip Packaging Technology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5643116/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11726836","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UTCP: A Novel Polyimide-Based Ultra-Thin Chip Packaging Technology","sourcePdf":"tcapt-christiaens-2060198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039633S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"5673023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5673023","articleId":"5643116","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5643121,"authors":[{"name":"Danish Ansari","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6144/5673023/5643121/5643121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Danish Ansari received the B.E. degree in mechanical engineering from Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India, in 2008, and the Masters degree in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics from Inha University, Incheon, South Korea, in 2010.

The thermal-resistance and pumping-power characteristics of the micro-channel heat sink have been investigated numerically. For optimization, four design variables, i.e., the ratios of the groove depth to the micro-channel height, the groove pitch to the micro-channel height, the groove diameter to pitch, and the micro-channel width to height are selected. The thermal resistance and the pumping power are the objective functions. The Navier-Stokes and energy equations for laminar flow and conjugate heat transfer are solved using a finite-volume solver. In comparison with a smooth micro-channel, a decrease in the thermal resistance and an increase in the Nusselt number are obtained in a grooved micro-channel at the expense of pumping power. The thermal resistance in a grooved micro-channel is lower than that in a smooth micro-channel for a fixed pumping power. The ratio of the groove pitch to micro-channel height is found to be the most Pareto-sensitive (sensitive along the Pareto-optimal front), whereas the ratio of the micro-channel width to height is found to be the least Pareto-sensitive variable.","doi":"10.1109/TCAPT.2010.2070874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAPT.2010.2070874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6144/5673023/05643121.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Grooved Micro-Channel Heat Sink","volume":"33","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11726840","htmlLink":"/document/5643121/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Grooved Micro-Channel Heat Sink","sourcePdf":"tcapt-kim-2070874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07972S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6144","isNumber":"5673023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6144","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5673023","articleId":"5643121","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5643123,"authors":[{"name":"Masafumi Kuramoto","affiliation":["LED Production Division, Nichia Corporation, Anan, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6144/5673023/5643123/5643123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masafumi Kuramoto received the M.S. degree in applied chemistry from the University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan, in 1987.","From 1987 to 1995, he was with New Japan Chemical Company, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan.

Two memory cells are put together to have a common vertical channel, which enables one to achieve a theoretical near-30-nm technology. The resulting array is made by folding the conventional 2-D Flash memory and is called FNAND. The memory storage node uses a BE stack structure, where the oxide-nitride-oxide multilayers replace the tunnel oxide. The fin structures for both wordline and bitline have been formed by sidewall spacer patterning, instead of photolithography.

Smoothing windows are used to mitigate these errors, and interpolation methods are applied in the frequency domain to reduce them further on. However, if cosine windows are employed, closed-form formulas for the evaluation of harmonic frequencies can be used only with the Rife-Vincent class I windows, while approximated formulas have to be used in other cases. In both cases, a high computation burden is required. This paper proposes a fast interpolation method, independent of the window type and order, based on suitable lookup tables. Experimental results are reported, and the accuracy is discussed, proving that the method provides results as good as those obtained with other methods, without requiring the same high computation burden.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2090051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2090051","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5742736/05643145.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5742736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast, Simplified Frequency-Domain Interpolation Method for the Evaluation of the Frequency and Amplitude of Spectral Components","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Fast, Simplified Frequency-Domain Interpolation Method for the Evaluation of the Frequency and Amplitude of Spectral Components","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2011","volume":"60","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643145/","accessionNumber":"11906043","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643145/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast, Simplified Frequency-Domain Interpolation Method for the Evaluation of the Frequency and Amplitude of Spectral Components","sourcePdf":"tim-ferrero-2090051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084486S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5742736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5742736","articleId":"5643145","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5643158,"authors":[{"name":"Chengzhi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Information, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5710128/5643158/5643158-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengzhi Zhao was born in 1973.

The DCA process is independently performed in every subnet to alleviate the signaling overheads and to apportion the DCA computational load among the subnets. Then a novel energy function is formulated to avoid causing mutual interference among neighboring subnets based on the real-time interference channel table. In each subnet, the proposed energy function also satisfies three interference constraints among cells and the number of required channels of each cell, and simultaneously minimizes the total number of assigned channels to improve spectrum utilization. A typical 441-cell LCN with 70 available channels, which can be decomposed into nine 49-cell DCSs, is examined to demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique by blocking probability, including uniform and hot spot traffic patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2091653","startPage":"222","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2091653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710128","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5710128/05643158.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Channel Assignment for Large-Scale Cellular Networks Using Noisy Chaotic Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643158/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Channel Assignment for Large-Scale Cellular Networks Using Noisy Chaotic Neural Network","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5643158/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11793998","pubMedId":"21097380","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Channel Assignment for Large-Scale Cellular Networks Using Noisy Chaotic Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhao-2091653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085111S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5710128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5710128","articleId":"5643158","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5643159,"authors":[{"name":"Robert S.

Multiple buses provide multiple configuration options for supplying power to the load. Diode OR'ing with auctioneering diodes is perhaps the most common method to connect a load to multiple buses. Although the diode action is automatic and fault-tolerant, it results in ill-defined bus currents when the bus voltages are similar and the potential for uncontrolled switching in a faulted high-impedance system-operating scenarios not often included in a discussion on auctioneering diodes. Active switching and bus converters with auctioneering diodes are control techniques that overcome these limitations by providing full control over the bus selection process. Using local information in the form of the bus voltage, these techniques do not rely on a centralized controller, which improves system reliability. Dwell time is proposed as a technique to stabilize the state-dependent switching in the bus selector.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05643159.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2094208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2094208","startPage":"860","endPage":"867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bus Selection in Multibus DC Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643159/","displayDocTitle":"Bus Selection in Multibus DC Microgrids","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643159/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"12004911","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bus Selection in Multibus DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpel-balog-2094208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086471S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5643159","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5643167,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5767816/5643167/5643167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patrick Lucey (M'08) received the B.Eng.

Such measures are problematic as they are: 1) subjective, and 2) give no specific timing information. Coding pain as a series of facial action units (AUs) can avoid these issues as it can be used to gain an objective measure of pain on a frame-by-frame basis. Using video data from patients with shoulder injuries, in this paper, we describe an active appearance model (AAM)-based system that can automatically detect the frames in video in which a patient is in pain. This pain data set highlights the many challenges associated with spontaneous emotion detection, particularly that of expression and head movement due to the patient's reaction to pain. In this paper, we show that the AAM can deal with these movements and can achieve significant improvements in both the AU and pain detection performance compared to the current-state-of-the-art approaches which utilize similarity-normalized appearance features only.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12004746","htmlLink":"/document/5643167/","pubMedId":"21097382","displayDocTitle":"Automatically Detecting Pain in Video Through Facial Action Units","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically Detecting Pain in Video Through Facial Action Units","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-lucey-2082525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08372S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5767816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5767816","articleId":"5643167","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5643176,"authors":[{"name":"Qian He","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Sichuan, China","ECE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5643176/5643176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian He (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.

If the noise-free received waveforms, due to target reflection, at each receiver span a space of dimension M' \u2264 M, the largest possible diversity gain is controlled by the value of min(NM', Q ) and the lowest order power in an expansion, about zero, of the cdf of the magnitude squared of a linear transformed version of the reflection coefficient vector.

The source first transmits locally. The cooperating nodes that receive the source signal retransmit a weighted version of it in an amplify-and-forward (AF) fashion. Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of the channel state information, beamforming weights are determined so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination is maximized subject to two different power constraints, i.e., a total (source and relay) power constraint, and individual relay power constraints. For the former constraint, the original problem is transformed into a problem of one variable, which can be solved via Newton's method. For the latter constraint, this problem is solved completely. It is shown that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the original problem always has a rank one solution, and hence the original problem is equivalent to finding the rank one solution of the SDP problem. An explicit construction of such a rank one solution is also provided. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed theoretical findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","volume":"59","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11805189","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643179/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Transmission for Relay Networks Based on Second-Order Statistics of Channel State Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Transmission for Relay Networks Based on Second-Order Statistics of Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2094614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094611S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5643179","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5643181,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Cheng Liao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering & Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5643181/5643181-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Cheng Liao received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in communications engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.","His research interests are in wireless communications and signal processing."]},"firstName":"Wei-Cheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37592113700"},{"name":"Tsung-Hui Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering & Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5643181/5643181-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Hui Chang (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","During September 2006 and February 2008, he was an exchange Ph.D. student of University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

This paper proposes a secret transmit beamforming approach using a quality-of-service (QoS)-based perspective. Specifically, we establish design formulations that: i) constrain the maximum allowable signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) of the eavesdroppers, and that ii) provide the intended receiver with a satisfactory SINR through either a guaranteed SINR constraint or SINR maximization. The proposed designs incorporate a relatively new idea called artificial noise (AN), where a suitable amount of AN is added in the transmitted signal to confuse the eavesdroppers. Our designs advocate joint optimization of the transmit weights and AN spatial distribution in accordance with the channel state information (CSI) of the intended receiver and eavesdroppers. Our formulated design problems are shown to be NP-hard in general. We deal with this difficulty by using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), an approximation technique based on convex optimization. Interestingly, we prove that SDR can exactly solve the design problems for a practically representative class of problem instances; e.g., when the intended receiver's instantaneous CSI is known. Extensions to the colluding-eavesdropper scenario and the multi-intended-receiver scenario are also examined. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed AN-aided designs can yield significant power savings or SINR enhancement compared to some other methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2094610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2094610","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05643181.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Based Transmit Beamforming in the Presence of Eavesdroppers: An Optimized Artificial-Noise-Aided Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Based Transmit Beamforming in the Presence of Eavesdroppers: An Optimized Artificial-Noise-Aided Approach","volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805190","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5643181/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Based Transmit Beamforming in the Presence of Eavesdroppers: An Optimized Artificial-Noise-Aided Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-ma-2094610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130237S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"286","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5643181","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5643183,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Mochaourab","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5710822/5643183/5643183-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rami Mochaourab (S'07) was born in Jarjouh, Lebanon, in 1982.

Each transmitter sends useful information only to its intended receivers and can degrade the performance of unintended systems. Here, we assume the performance measures associated with each receiver are monotonic with the received power gains. In general, the joint performance of the systems is desired to be Pareto optimal. However, designing Pareto optimal resource allocation schemes is known to be difficult. In order to reduce the complexity of achieving efficient operating points, we show that it is sufficient to consider rank-1 transmit covariance matrices and propose a framework for determining the efficient beamforming vectors. These beamforming vectors are thereby also parameterized by \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n-1) real-valued parameters each between zero and one. The framework is based on analyzing each transmitter's power gain-region which is composed of all jointly achievable power gains at the receivers. The efficient beamforming vectors are on a specific boundary section of the power gain-region, and in certain scenarios it is shown that it is necessary to perform additional power allocation on the beamforming vectors. Two examples which include broadcast and multicast data as well as a cognitive radio application scenario illustrate the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05643183.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2094612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2094612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Beamforming in Interference Networks with Perfect Local Channel Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cognitive radio","covariance matrices","interference (signal)","Pareto optimisation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal beamforming","interference networks","perfect local channel information","multiantenna transmitters","single antenna receivers","Pareto optimal resource allocation","covariance matrices","power gain region","broadcast data","multicast data","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","interference networks","multiple-input single-output","Pareto optimality","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Beamforming in Interference Networks with Perfect Local Channel Information","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5643183/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11805191","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Beamforming in Interference Networks with Perfect Local Channel Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-mochaourab-2094612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144418S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5643183","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5643185,"authors":[{"name":"Philip A.

Precoding can reduce crosstalk in the downstream from the access node to the customer premises equipment significantly if an accurate estimate of the inverse crosstalk channel is provided. Recently, a backward-compatible method has been proposed for estimating downstream crosstalk channels using standardized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reports. This paper develops a probabilistic model of the estimation process and, within this model, provides conditions under which successive updates of the precoder are guaranteed to converge to the ideal inverse precoder. Bounds on estimator variance and convergence times are obtained and optimized with respect to system parameters. The analysis can be applied to the situation in which a new line is being activated and added to a group of precoded lines seamlessly, that is, with controlled impact on the SNR of the active lines. Two phases are proposed to achieve seamless activation; the protection phase is used to let the active lines learn the crosstalk from the activating line and the acquisition phase is used to let the activating line learn the crosstalk from the active lines. Results of the analysis are illustrated by numerical simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2094189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5710822/05643185.pdf","endPage":"1115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Inverse Crosstalk Channel Estimation Using SNR Feedback","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2094189","startPage":"1102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Inverse Crosstalk Channel Estimation Using SNR Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643185/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805192","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5643185/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Inverse Crosstalk Channel Estimation Using SNR Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsp-nuzman-2094189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105713S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5710822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5710822","articleId":"5643185","onlineDate":"22 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5643186,"authors":[{"name":"Ananya Sen Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5725269/5643186/5643186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ananya Sen Gupta received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","Throughout her research career she has been interested in seeking novel solutions for signal processing challenges commonly encountered in real environments.

The need for expensive redesign to include any change in the interfering signals is a fundamental limitation of MACE-JSIC detection despite its high performance and low detection complexity. In this work, we derive sufficiency criteria that reduce maximum asymptotic efficiency (MAE) detection to low-complexity decorrelation and exploit this relationship to extend the MACE-JSIC approach to time-varying communication systems.

State-of-the-art systems adopt regular expressions due to their high expressive power. They are typically matched through deterministic finite automata (DFAs), but large rule sets need a memory amount that turns out to be too large for practical implementation. Many recent works have proposed improvements to address this issue, but they increase the number of transitions (and then of memory accesses) per character. This paper presents a new representation for DFAs, orthogonal to most of the previous solutions, called delta finite automata ( \u03b4FA), which considerably reduces states and transitions while preserving a transition per character only, thus allowing fast matching.

Due to the limitation of available spectrum resource, high spectrum efficiency technologies are needed to be explored for different OSI layers. Over last decades, many technologies have been investigated to achieve this target. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and channel-aware scheduling are two promising schemes proposed for that achievement. In this paper, we investigate the impact of MIMO and scheduling in the increasing of the system throughput of next generation mobile wireless systems when transmitting on different channels for several transmission modes.

Rapid growth of web sites and web applications gives way to deliver complex business applications through the web. As the web dependency increases, so do the web hacking activities. Web applications are normally written in scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP embedded in HTML allowing connectivity to the databases, retrieving data and putting them in the WWW site. A web application is vulnerable to many kinds of threats and attacks. In order to detect known attacks, some set of attack rules and detections are needed. In this paper, a negative security model based on misuse of web applications is used. This negative security model provides a Web Application Firewall(WAF) engine with a rule set, to ensure critical protection across every web architecture. WAFs are deployed to establish an increased external security layer to detect and/or prevent attacks before they reach web applications. This paper has been tested with apache web server's log file. We have tested successfully almost all the common attacks. This paper also allows for HTTP traffic monitoring and real-time analysis with little or no changes to existing infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643461","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637902/5643452/05643461.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5643452","startPage":"481","endPage":"486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection using negative security model in web application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection using negative security model in web application","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643461/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664065","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5643461/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection using negative security model in web application","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"R0481P052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054356S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637902","isNumber":"5643452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637902","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5643452","articleId":"5643461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5643497,"authors":[{"name":"Anshu Gupta","affiliation":["Electronic and Instrumentation Department, SGSITS, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Anshu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37596507500"},{"name":"U.B.S.

The first step of settling places charge onto the load capacitance using charge pumps, and the second fulfills the settling requirements using negative feedback. The key factor is to establish the optimum combination of gm2/gm1 & Cl/Cc. So, required accuracy & settling time can be established with minimum power consumption. An experimental prototype fabricated in a 0.18um CMOS UMC tech. using cadence requires power consumption of 50\u00b5W for Cload=5pf. Typical measured results are 75 dB gain, UGB of 16 MHz, 80ns settling time, PM 60 deg, SR is +6/\u22126V/us, CMRR is 90dB. The chip active area is about 45 \u00b5m X 35 \u00b5m. Three stage CMOS opamp: The three stage CMOS opamp with NMC technique is also designed. Simulated results are DC Gain of 90dB, Unity Gain frequency 30MHz, Power consumption 300 \u00b5W, Settling Time 150 ns with Cload 1pf.

In this paper, an algorithm is proposed wherein an HMM, which is a doubly embedded stochastic process, is used for the shape based clustering of data. These data clusters are trained individually with Neural Network. The novel prediction approach used here exploits the Pattern Identification prowess of the HMM for cluster selection and uses the NN associated with each cluster to predict the output of the system. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated by using the benchmark chaotic time series: Mackey Glass Time Series (MGTS).

Performances of classification techniques were compared using lift chart and error rates. In the result, artificial neural networks have the greatest area between the model curve and the baseline curve. The error rates are 0.22, 0.198, 0.21, respectively for logistic regression, artificial neural networks and decision trees. The neural networks exhibited sensitivity of 81.1%, specificity of 78.7% and accuracy of 80.2%, while the decision tree provided the prediction performance with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 81.7%, 76.0% and 79.3%. And the logistic regression provided the prediction performance with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 81.2%,73.1% and 77.7% Artificial neural networks have the least of error rate and has the highest accuracy, therefore Artificial neural networks is the best technique to classify in this data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643666/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664104","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643666/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing performances of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks for classifying heart disease patients","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing performances of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks for classifying heart disease patients","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"R0193C059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062968S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637902","isNumber":"5643452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637902","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5643452","articleId":"5643666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5643670,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Manufacturing value added, gas price, electricity price, occupied person, and total investment are considered as variables for annual energy consumption. According to high fluctuations in this kind of industries, conventional methods do not seem to forecast energy consumption correctly and precisely. Artificial neural network based on a supervised multi-layer perceptron, multiple logarithmic regressions, and autoregressive integrated moving average models are utilized and compared each other for this sector of Iran's industries. Neural networks model, which are presented in this study, have been trained with two different algorithms and one normalization method is used for pre- and post-process of data. Moreover, the logarithmic transformed data are used as inputs for the neural network models. By comparing results, the network model based on logarithmic data will reveal much more accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643670/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11664108","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643670/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and comparing energy consumption in basic metal industries by neural networks and ARIMA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and comparing energy consumption in basic metal industries by neural networks and ARIMA","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"R0171C041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064819S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637902","isNumber":"5643452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637902","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5643452","articleId":"5643670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5643675,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Pakdaman Naeini","affiliation":["IT & Computer Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"lastName":"Mahdi Pakdaman Naeini","id":"37586822900"},{"name":"Hamidreza Taremian","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Taremian","id":"37586824100"},{"name":"Homa Baradaran Hashemi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"lastName":"Homa Baradaran Hashemi","id":"37586820600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7818-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7817-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7816-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5643675","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1826},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643675","abstract":"Neural networks, as an intelligent data mining method, have been used in many different challenging pattern recognition problems such as stock market prediction. However, there is no formal method to determine the optimal neural network for prediction purpose in the literature. In this paper, two kinds of neural networks, a feed forward multi layer Perceptron (MLP) and an Elman recurrent network, are used to predict a company's stock value based on its stock share value history. The experimental results show that the application of MLP neural network is more promising in predicting stock value changes rather than Elman recurrent network and linear regression method. However, based on the standard measures that will be presented in the paper we find that the Elman recurrent network and linear regression can predict the direction of the changes of the stock value better than the MLP.","doi":"10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643675","startPage":"132","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637902/5643452/05643675.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5643452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stock market value prediction using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Stock markets","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Predictive models","Training","Forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","multilayer perceptrons","pattern recognition","recurrent neural nets","regression analysis","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock market value prediction","intelligent data mining method","pattern recognition problem","formal method","optimal neural network","feed forward multilayer perceptron","Elman recurrent network","company stock share value history","MLP neural network","linear regression method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stock market prediction","Data mining","neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Stock market value prediction using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11664113","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stock market value prediction using neural networks","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"R0132C078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045986S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637902","isNumber":"5643452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637902","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5643452","articleId":"5643675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5643712,"authors":[{"name":"xing-hui Zhang","affiliation":["Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"xing-hui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598095600"},{"name":"jian-she Kang","affiliation":["Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"jian-she","lastName":"Kang","id":"37592275900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7706-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7705-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7704-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5643712","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":474},"abstract":"Hidden Markov model (HMM) have powerful capability of pattern classification.

The fuzzy ART neural network is capable of rapid stable learning of recognition categories, and it can determine the total number of categories adaptively. At first, in the background modeling stage, the fuzzy ART neural networks were applied to classify the background and non-background categories, and the non-background categories were discarded so as to build the background model. Then the background model was combined with fuzzy ART neural networks to detect the targets. Experiments have been carried out and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust to noise, and can eliminate the halo effectively.

We propose several constraints for the plants from the engineering point of view and the cost function is also simplified. No complicated mathematics is used which originated from the characteristics of PSO. This method is easy to be used to control the plants with linear or/and nonlinear constraints. Numerical simulations are used to show the performance of this control technique for linear and nonlinear processes, respectively.

We present a physics-based discussion of current-voltage relationships, short channel effects, and leakage and show the application of ADSE FinFETs in 6T static random access memory (SRAM) bit cell. By exploiting asymmetry in current, we show that it is possible to achieve improvement in both read and write stability for the 6T SRAM bit cell, along with reduction in cell leakage at the cost of negligible increase in access time and area. We also propose a general circuit-aware device optimization methodology for SRAM design. We use this methodology to optimize the underlap in ADSE FinFETs. Compared to conventional FinFETs, we achieve 57% reduction in leakage, 11% improvement in read static-noise margin, and 6% improvement in write margin, with 7% increase in access time and cell area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643924/","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5643924/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11762232","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Drain Spacer Extension (ADSE) FinFETs for Low-Power and Robust SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Drain Spacer Extension (ADSE) FinFETs for Low-Power and Robust SRAMs","sourcePdf":"ted-goel-2090421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125365S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5697316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5697316","articleId":"5643924","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5643935,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Tsang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5702419/5643935/5643935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Po-Tsang Huang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan, in 2002.

As routing tables become larger, energy consumption and leakage current become increasingly important issues in the design of TCAM in nano-scale technologies. This work presents a novel 65 nm energy-efficient TCAM macro design for IPv6 applications. The proposed TCAM employs the concept of architecture and circuit co-design. To achieve an energy-efficient TCAM architecture, a butterfly match-line scheme and a hierarchy search-line scheme are developed to reduce significantly both the search time and power consumption. The match-lines are also implemented using noise-tolerant XOR-based conditional keepers to reduce not only the search time but also the power consumption. To reduce the increasing leakage power in advanced technologies, the proposed TCAM design utilizes two power gating techniques, namely super cut-off power gating and multi-mode data-retention power gating. An energy-efficient 256 \u00d7 144 TCAM macro is implemented using UMC 65 nm CMOS technology, and the experimental results demonstrate a leakage power reduction of 19.3% and an energy metric of the TCAM macro of 0.165 fJ/bit/search.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2082270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5702419/05643935.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5702419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2082270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 65 nm 0.165 fJ/Bit/Search 256-144 TCAM Macro Design for IPv6 Lookup Tables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A 65 nm 0.165 fJ/Bit/Search 256<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>144 TCAM Macro Design for IPv6 Lookup Tables","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643935/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11775697","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5643935/","volume":"46","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 65 nm 0.165 fJ/Bit/Search 256<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>144 TCAM Macro Design for IPv6 Lookup Tables","sourcePdf":"jssc-hwang-2082270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14497S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5702419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5702419","articleId":"5643935","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5643958,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Ruede","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ruede","id":"37427525700"},{"name":"Sylke Bechstein","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sylke","lastName":"Bechstein","id":"37427514600"},{"name":"Ling Hao","affiliation":["National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Hao","id":"37288689100"},{"name":"Cornelia A\u00dfmann","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Cornelia","lastName":"A\u00dfmann","id":"37425141700"},{"name":"Thomas Schurig","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Schurig","id":"37313186400"},{"name":"John Gallop","affiliation":["National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Gallop","id":"37301592400"},{"name":"Olga Kazakova","affiliation":["National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Kazakova","id":"37321285100"},{"name":"J\u00f6rn Beyer","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rn","lastName":"Beyer","id":"37315609900"},{"name":"Dietmar Drung","affiliation":["Physikalisch-Technisch Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Drung","id":"37313181900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"5643958","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"abstract":"NanoSQUID sensors (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices with nanoscale dimensions) are regarded as a useful tool for sensitive magnetic measurements and have achieved a low noise level.

data services. Due to low recharging rates and the dynamics of renewable energy such as solar and wind power, providing services without interruptions caused by battery runouts is nontrivial. Most environment monitoring applications require data collection from all nodes at a steady rate. The objective of this paper is to design a solution for fair and high throughput data extraction from all nodes in the presence of renewable energy sources. Specifically, we seek to compute the lexicographically maximum data collection rate and routing paths for each node such that no node will ever run out of energy. We propose a centralized algorithm and two distributed algorithms. The centralized algorithm jointly computes the optimal data collection rate for all nodes along with the flows on each link, the first distributed algorithm computes the optimal rate when the routing structure is a given tree, and the second distributed algorithm, although heuristic, jointly computes a routing structure and a high lexicographic rate assignment that is nearly optimum. We prove the optimality for the centralized and the first distributed algorithm, and use real test-bed experiments and extensive simulations to evaluate both of the distributed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2091280","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5985586/05643974.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2091280","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"947","endPage":"960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perpetual and Fair Data Collection for Environmental Energy Harvesting Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5643974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Perpetual and Fair Data Collection for Environmental Energy Harvesting Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5643974/","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5643974/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206002","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perpetual and Fair Data Collection for Environmental Energy Harvesting Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-liu-2091280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143608S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5985586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5985586","articleId":"5643974","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5644051,"authors":[{"name":"Dragan Mati\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Science, Department for Automation and System Control, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, NoviSad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Mati\u0107","id":"37975524400"},{"name":"Filip Kuli\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Science, cDepartment for Automation and System Control, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Kuli\u0107","id":"37394285300"},{"name":"Vincente Climente-Alarc\u00f3n","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Comino de Vera, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vincente","lastName":"Climente-Alarc\u00f3n","id":"38273713700"},{"name":"Ruben Puche-Panadero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Comino de Vera, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Puche-Panadero","id":"38274015900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8820-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8821-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8819-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5644051","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644051","abstract":"Paper deals with application of online rotor broken bar fault detection via artificial neural networks.

Utility Management Systems (UMS) are managing very large numbers of workflows with very high resource requirements. This paper proposes a UMS scheduling architecture which dynamically executes a scheduling algorithm using near real-time feedback about the current status of grid nodes. Workflow scheduling was performed with an artificial neural network (ANN). The network was trained in a system with three workflows. The case study presented in this paper shows results achieved in a three workflow system, as well as results achieved in a five workflow system where an adaptive ANN was used. The results testify that significant improvement of overall execution time can be achieved by adapting weights in the neural network.","doi":"10.1109/NEUREL.2010.5644102","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"10th Symposium on Neural Network Applications in Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEUREL.2010.5644102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644027","displayPublicationTitle":"10th Symposium on Neural Network Applications in Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628343/5644027/05644102.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive neural network workflow management for Utility Management Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644102/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network workflow management for Utility Management Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644102/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11676974","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network workflow management for Utility Management Systems","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"036S4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046889S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628343","isNumber":"5644027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628343","xplore-issue":"5644027","articleId":"5644102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5644104,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Serbia"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Stankovi\u0107","id":"37331381000"},{"name":"Bratislav Milovanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Serbia"],"firstName":"Bratislav","lastName":"Milovanovi\u0107","id":"37299972500"},{"name":"Neboj\u0161a Doncov","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Nia, Serbia"],"firstName":"Neboj\u0161a","lastName":"Doncov","id":"37323441900"},{"name":"Marija Miliji\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Nia, Serbia"],"firstName":"Marija","lastName":"Miliji\u0107","id":"38547349500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8820-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8821-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8819-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5644104","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Load modeling","Resonant frequency","Dielectrics","Neurons","Slabs","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","microwave heating","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave applicator modeling","domain knowledge","numerical technique","artificial neural network","neural model","microwave cavity applicators","cylindrical metallic cavity","circular cross-section"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","domain knowledge","microwave applicators","neural models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644104","abstract":"Alternative and more efficient approaches for microwave applicators modeling, in respect to conventional numerical techniques, are presented in the paper.

The first and essential step for the diagnosis is the automatic spleen segmentation that is still an open problem. In this paper, we have proposed a new automatic algorithm for spleen area extraction in abdominal MRI images. The algorithm is fully automatic and contains several stages. The preprocessing stage is applied for required image enhancement. Then the abdominal MRI images are partitioned to different regions using combined recursive watershed transform and neural network. The feed forward neural network is trained and used for spleen features extraction. The features extracted using neural networks are used to monitor the quality of the output of watershed transform and adjusting required parameter automatically. The process of adjusting parameters is performed sequentially in several iterations. Experimental results showed the promise of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644110/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11676980","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644110/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic spleen segmentation in MRI images using a combined neural network and recursive watershed transform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic spleen segmentation in MRI images using a combined neural network and recursive watershed transform","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"028S3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048087S","chronDate":"23-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628343","isNumber":"5644027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628343","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5644027","articleId":"5644110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5644385,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

As a result, researchers have attempted to meet the growing data demands using parallel and external memory techniques. We present a novel asynchronous approach to compute Breadth-First-Search (BFS), Single-Source-Shortest-Paths, and Connected Components for large graphs in shared memory. Our highly parallel asynchronous approach hides data latency due to both poor locality and delays in the underlying graph data storage. We present an experimental study applying our technique to both In-Memory and Semi-External Memory graphs utilizing multi-core processors and solid-state memory devices. Our experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets show that our asynchronous approach is able to overcome data latencies and provide significant speedup over alternative approaches. For example, on billion vertex graphs our asynchronous BFS scales up to 14 x on 16-cores.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multithreaded Asynchronous Graph Traversal for In-Memory and Semi-External Memory","publicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","doi":"10.1109/SC.2010.34","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644813/5644843/05644845.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2010.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multithreaded Asynchronous Graph Traversal for In-Memory and Semi-External Memory","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644845/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675865","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multithreaded Asynchronous Graph Traversal for In-Memory and Semi-External Memory","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105066S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5644845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":5644849,"authors":[{"name":"U.

We consider a network of cognitive radio nodes comprising single source, multiple relays and multiple destinations. For this system, we formulate an optimization problem to allocate power to source and relays and assign the relays to the destinations. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program. Then, we show that the formulation can be reduced into a simpler integer programming problem. Then, we propose a BPSO-based relay assignment scheme to attain a good suboptimal solution to this integer programming problem. The proposed scheme has low computational complexity, and simulation results show that its performance is close to the optimal exhaustive search algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11677976","htmlLink":"/document/5644849/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An efficient relay assignment scheme for multiuser cognitive radio networks with discrete power control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient relay assignment scheme for multiuser cognitive radio networks with discrete power control","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p653pareek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081258S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5644849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5644851,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Long","affiliation":["Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Jia Long","id":"37593834500"},{"name":"Changcheng Huang","affiliation":["Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Changcheng Huang","id":"37281273100"},{"name":"James Yan","affiliation":["Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"James Yan","id":"37281331600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7742-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7743-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7803-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7741-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5644851","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644851","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cognitive radio","Protocols","IP networks","Wireless sensor networks","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","signalling protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network assisted auctioning","cognitive radios","centralized server","licensed spectrum utilization","spectrum scanning","channel distribution","power consumption","higher layer solution","wireless technology","wireless networks","SIP","communication protocol","channel allocation","incumbent network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Network Assistance","Channel Allocation","Auctioning","Session Initiation Protocol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5644851","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05644851.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5644851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network assisted auctioning for cognitive radios","abstract":"In this paper, the use of a centralized server to assist cognitive radio users in accessing bands in licensed spectrums is proposed. Typical cognitive radios are opportunistic users of spectrum bands. Therefore, they must scan the spectrum to detect existing users in order to avoid interference. The use of a centralized server can remove the need for spectrum scanning if all users inform the server about their presence. The server will coordinate and distribute channels to cognitive radio users using auctioning mechanisms. Our approach removes the need for cognitive radio users to spectrum scan. Scanning can be costly in terms of time and power consumption. In addition, collisions between users due to hidden node problem can be removed. The use of a centralized server allows for higher layer solution that would allow users of different wireless technologies to communicate. Due to its flexibility of use across different wireless networks, SIP is adopted as the communication protocol between the central server and the primary and secondary users of the licensed spectrum. Using a SIP server to coordinate channel allocation through auctioning approach can generate revenue for the incumbent network. Results show that revenue can be generated while still meeting the goal of efficient spectrum utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644851/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11677951","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644851/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Network assisted auctioning for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network assisted auctioning for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p669long.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066985S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5644851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5644859,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In particular, an optimal routing strategy is proposed to minimize the end-to-end total transmission power subject to end-to-end target rate. An ad-hoc routing strategy is proposed to find an optimal route (in terms of total transmit power minimizing) for decode-and forward strategy based on the well known Dijikstra algorithm which can be easily implemented in distributed way.

Our new methodology for large-scale graph analytics combines a highlevel algorithmic design that captures the machine-independent aspects, to guarantee portability with performance to future processors, with an implementation that embeds processorspecific optimizations. We present an experimental study that uses state-of-the-art Intel Nehalem EP and EX processors and up to 64 threads in a single system. Our performance on several benchmark problems representative of the power-law graphs found in real-world problems reaches processing rates that are competitive with supercomputing results in the recent literature.

The CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming model provides improved programmability for general computing on GPGPUs.

This paper proposes a new programming interface, called OpenMPC, which builds on OpenMP to provide an abstraction of the complex CUDA programming model and offers high-level controls of the involved parameters and optimizations. We have developed a fully automatic compilation and user-assisted tuning system supporting OpenMPC. In addition to a range of compiler transformations and optimizations, the system includes tuning capabilities for generating, pruning, and navigating the search space of compilation variants. Our results demonstrate that OpenMPC offers both programmability and tunability.

This move to many-core chips is driven by a need to optimize performance per watt. How best to connect these cores and how to program the resulting many-core processor, however, is an open research question. Designs vary from GPUs to cache-coherent shared memory multiprocessors to pure distributed memory chips.

Variability in the IO Performance of Petascale Storage Systems","abstract":"Significant challenges exist for achieving peak or even consistent levels of performance when using IO systems at scale. They stem from sharing IO system resources across the processes of single largescale applications and/or multiple simultaneous programs causing internal and external interference, which in turn, causes substantial reductions in IO performance. This paper presents interference effects measurements for two different file systems at multiple supercomputing sites. These measurements motivate developing a 'managed' IO approach using adaptive algorithms varying the IO system workload based on current levels and use areas. An implementation of these methods deployed for the shared, general scratch storage system on Oak Ridge National Laboratory machines achieves higher overall performance and less variability in both a typical usage environment and with artificially introduced levels of 'noise'. The latter serving to clearly delineate and illustrate potential problems arising from shared system usage and the advantages derived from actively managing it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644883/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11675867","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644883/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Managing Variability in the IO Performance of Petascale Storage Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing Variability in the IO Performance of Petascale Storage Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096587S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5644883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5644890,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Virginia Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37597517000"},{"name":"Sudharshan S.

The I/O bottleneck often negates potential performance benefits of assigning additional compute cores to an application. In this paper, we address this issue via a novel functional partitioning (FP) runtime environment that allocates cores to specific application tasks - checkpointing, de-duplication, and scientific data format transformation - so that the deluge of cores can be brought to bear on the entire gamut of application activities. The focus is on utilizing the extra cores to support HPC application I/O activities and also leverage solid-state disks in this context. For example, our evaluation shows that dedicating 1 core on an oct-core machine for checkpointing and its assist tasks using FP can improve overall execution time of a FLASH benchmark on 80 and 160 cores by 43.95% and 41.34%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2010.28","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644813/5644843/05644890.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2010.28","publicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional Partitioning to Optimize End-to-End Performance on Many-core Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Functional Partitioning to Optimize End-to-End Performance on Many-core Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644890/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675857","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional Partitioning to Optimize End-to-End Performance on Many-core Architectures","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127011S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5644890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5644896,"authors":[{"name":"Scott S.

With stagnating clock frequencies, the evolutionary path for performance of microprocessors is maintained by virtue of core multiplication. Graphical processing units (GPUs) offer revolutionary performance potential at the cost of increased programming complexity. Furthermore, it has been extremely challenging to effectively utilize heterogeneous resources (host processor and GPU cores) for scientific simulations, as underlying systems, programming models and tools are continually evolving. In this paper, we present a parametric study demonstrating approaches to exploit resources of heterogeneous systems to reduce time-to-solution of a production-level application for biological simulations. By overlapping and pipelining computation and communication, we observe up to 10-fold application acceleration in multi-core and multi-GPU environments illustrating significant performance improvements over code acceleration approaches, where the host-to-accelerator ratio is static, and is constrained by a given algorithmic implementation.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2010.37","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644813/5644843/05644896.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2010.37","publicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Utilization of Heterogeneous Resources for Biomolecular Simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Utilization of Heterogeneous Resources for Biomolecular Simulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644896/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5644896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675872","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Utilization of Heterogeneous Resources for Biomolecular Simulations","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080803S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5644896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5644906,"authors":[{"name":"Tsuyoshi Hamada","affiliation":["Nagasaki Advanced Computing Center, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Hamada","id":"37534199600"},{"name":"Keigo Nitadori","affiliation":["High-Performance Molecular Simulation Team, Riken Advanced Science Institute, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Keigo","lastName":"Nitadori","id":"37604363200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7559-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7557-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7558-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"5644906","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"We present the results of a hierarchical N-body simulation on DEGIMA, a cluster of PCs with 576 graphic processing units (GPUs) and using an InfiniBand interconnect.

Moreover, we implemented sparse matrix multiplication of the form required by the solver as it is also very time consuming for some LP problems. Implemented on the Cell BE processor (Playstation 3) and tested using Netlib data sets, our LP solver achieved a maximum speedup of 2.9 just by using the mixed-precision technique. Moreover, we found that some problems, especially in final iterations, result in ill-conditioned matrices where mixed-precision can not be used.

The objective is to minimize the energy consumption of the whole platform, while satisfying given performance-related bounds on the period and latency of each application. The problem is to decide which processors to enroll, at which speed (or mode) to use them, and which stages they should execute. We distinguish two mapping categories, interval mappings without reuse, and fully arbitrary general mappings. On the theoretical side, we establish complexity results for this tri-criteria mapping problem (energy, period, latency). Furthermore, we derive an integer linear program that provides the optimal solution in the most general case. On the experimental side, we design polynomial-time heuristics, and assess their absolute performance thanks to the linear program.

The complexity of maximum likelihood (ML) soft detection for turbo coded MIMO schemes increases exponentially by the number of antennas and modulation orders, and thus it is a NP hard problem. In this paper, we divide the soft detection process as three sequential steps and this highly reduces the computational complexity. The three sequential steps include ZF detection of the transmitted modulation symbol, soft demapping, and application of proper channel gain. We demonstrate the simulation results on fast and slow fading channels and show that the proposed soft ZF scheme can achieve just a dB power loss with dramatically reduced detection complexity compared to ML detection.","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5644980","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05644980.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5644980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft ZF MIMO detection for turbo codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5644980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft ZF MIMO detection for turbo codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5644980/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11677940","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5644980/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft ZF MIMO detection for turbo codes","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p116shang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067361S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5644980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5645003,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Y.

In this strategy, the relays cooperate according to contribution factors suggested by each relay. The selection of the OFDM sub-channels is based on uniform random distribution where the thresholds of the uniform random variable are associated with the contribution factors. This approach guarantees fairness in allocating the resources in each relay. The approach is compared with static allocation of the OFDM sub-channels. The MARS strategy is tested in a multi relay system over flat and selective Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the OFDM system performance in terms of BER. The performance is achieved by creating a virtual diversity by randomizing the allocation where no channel information is required.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05645003.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"599","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random-based fair allocation in Multi-Relay cooperative OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirelay cooperative OFDM system","random-based fair allocation","multirelay adaptive random selection","dual-hop multirelay OFDM system","OFDM sub-channels","resource allocation","Rayleigh fading channels","BER","virtual diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Random-based fair allocation in Multi-Relay cooperative OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678029","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random-based fair allocation in Multi-Relay cooperative OFDM system","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p596abualhaol.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074029S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5645003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5645004,"authors":[{"name":"Binod Vaidya","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless and Internetworking Research Laboratory School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Binod","lastName":"Vaidya","id":"37394446700"},{"name":"Dimitrios Makrakis","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless and Internetworking Research Laboratory School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Makrakis","id":"37268381300"},{"name":"Hussein T.

WSNs can be deployed in unattended environments, where a registered user can login to the network and access data collected by the linked sensors. Authenticating users in resource constrained environments is one of the major security concerns. Since sensor nodes have limited resources and computation power, it is desirable that the authentication protocol is simple and efficient. In 2009, M. L. Das proposed a two-factor authentication for WSNs, where a user has to prove possession of both, a password and a smart card. Since his scheme utilizes only cryptographic one-way hash function and exclusive-OR operation, it is well-suited for resource constrained environments. However, Khan and Algahathbar pointed out that Das's scheme has some flaws and is vulnerable to various attacks and proposed an alternative solution. In this paper, we show that both, Das's and Khan-Algahathbar's schemes have flaws and remain vulnerable to various attacks including stolen smart card attacks. To overcome the security weaknesses of both schemes, we propose an improved two-factor user authentication that is resilient to stolen smart card attacks as well as other common types of attacks. We provide security evaluation of the proposed protocols showing its robustness to various attacks and analyzed the scheme's performance to determine its efficiency. Compared to the previous schemes, it is proven more robust and provides better security.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05645004.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"606","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645004","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645004","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645004","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Smart cards","Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Protocols","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","smart cards","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved two factor user authentication","wireless sensor networks","security weaknesses","stolen smart card attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor network","user authentication","password","smart card"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645004/","displayDocTitle":"Improved two-factor user authentication in wireless sensor networks","accessionNumber":"11678030","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645004/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved two-factor user authentication in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p600vaidya.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060354S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5645004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5645005,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien Delestre","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"Delestre","id":"37594945800"},{"name":"Yichuang Sun","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Yichuang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278741400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7742-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7743-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7803-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7741-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5645005","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Receiving antennas","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO-OFDM","pilot-aided channel estimation","WiMax systems","training sequence","transmit antennas","receive antennas","space-time coding","channel coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Othogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)","WiMax","channel estimation","Space-Time Codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a channel estimation scheme for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on training sequence.

By avoiding channel dependent matrix inversion, which is inevitable in the case of minimum mean square error (MMSE)-ZP-OFDM transmissions, and incorporating linear processing techniques, we show that our proposed receiver is able to bring significant complexity reduction in the receiver design, while outperforming cooperative MMSE-ZP-OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645006","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05645006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","startPage":"591","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative detection for zero-padded OFDM in non-regenerative cooperative wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative detection for zero-padded OFDM in non-regenerative cooperative wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645006/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11677959","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645006/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative detection for zero-padded OFDM in non-regenerative cooperative wireless networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p591eghbali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123659S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5645006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645007,"authors":[{"name":"Muayad S.

The average system throughput is represented as a trade-off criterion between the spectral efficiency and bit error rate (BER). The considered AMC technique utilizes distinct modulation and coding scheme (MCS) options rather than adopting fixed or uncoded approaches. The transmitter divides the OFDMA frame at each transmit antenna into bands depending on the number of active users in an assigned base station (BS).

However, D2D transmitters may cause significant amount of interference to the primary cellular network when radio resources are shared between them. During the downlink (DL) phase, primary cell UE (user equipment) may suffer from interference by the D2D transmitter. On the other hand, the immobile eNodeB is the victim of interference by the D2D transmitter during the uplink (UL) phase when radio resources are allocated randomly. Such interference can be avoided otherwise diminish if radio resource allocated intelligently with the coordination from the eNodeB. In this paper, we formulate the problem of radio resource allocation to the D2D communications as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). Such an optimization problem is notoriously hard to solve within fast scheduling period of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. We therefore propose an alternative greedy heuristic algorithm that can lessen interference to the primary cellular network utilizing channel gain information. We also perform extensive simulation to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645039","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05645039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","startPage":"368","endPage":"375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient resource allocation for device-to-device communication underlaying LTE network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient resource allocation for device-to-device communication underlaying LTE network","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645039/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11677971","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient resource allocation for device-to-device communication underlaying LTE network","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p368zulhasnine.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063992S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"343","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5645039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5645045,"authors":[{"name":"Anas F.

As a consequence of the wide variety service demands in terms of data rate and Quality of Service (QoS), the traffic pattern is considered to be heterogeneous. Therefore, the complexity of obtaining Base Stations (BSs) positions increases with the randomness of the traffic distribution. In addition to this challenge, the capacity of each BS is limited due to power and bandwidth constraints, propagation losses, Gaussian antenna pattern, and the Co-Channel Interference (CCI), which in turn increase the complexity measures for an efficient network design. According to Nash Equilibrium, combined efficient systems must perform equally to achieve certain performance. This implies that the traffic of a cellular system should be equally distributed over all the BSs to achieve the highest network performance. Hence, we formulate the planning problem as a non-linear multi-objective optimization problem. The optimum solution should not dominate the throughput of one BS over the others and this is referred to as Pareto optimal. However, loading all cells equally may not be possible in certain traffic distributions. Therefore, the proposed method tends to approach the optimal solution by tackling the problems of BS positioning and resource allocation simultaneously. We adopt a hybrid approach, i.e. Pareto-Metaheuristic (PMH) that achieves a balanced throughput over all cells as well as minimizing the number of the installed BSs targeting a certain service outage probability. Simulation results show that, in addition to maximizing the individual cell throughput, the network throughput variation decreases as the number of iteration increases.","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645045","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 6th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637454/5644846/05645045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644846","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto-metaheuristic multi-objective network optimization for OFDMA-based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pareto-metaheuristic multi-objective network optimization for OFDMA-based systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645045/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11678013","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto-metaheuristic multi-objective network optimization for OFDMA-based systems","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p331alrawi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051012S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5645045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645052,"authors":[{"name":"Israel Gu\u00edo","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Gu\u00edo","id":"37596900800"},{"name":"\u00c1ngela Hern\u00e1ndez-Solana","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"\u00c1ngela","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez-Solana","id":"38185150100"},{"name":"Vanesa Montero","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Vanesa","lastName":"Montero","id":"37596893500"},{"name":"Javier Lafuente-Mart\u00ednez","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Lafuente-Mart\u00ednez","id":"38270950000"},{"name":"Antonio Valdovinos","affiliation":["Arag\u00f3n Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Valdovinos","id":"37284818200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7742-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7743-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7803-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7741-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5645052","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance gain achieved when a channel-aware deferring (CaD) strategy is applied to defer the allocation of users with transitory bad channel state in a mobile OFDMA system.

this paper, we consider a cooperative relaying based cognitive radio (CR) networks in which the primary receivers are protected by peak interference power constraint. In such scenario, finding the transmission opportunity with a target data rate by maintaining the interference power constraint is the prime goal of the system. We show that cooperative relaying techniques can significantly reduce the outage probability equivalently, improve the transmission opportunity of the CR networks in slow-fading channels. We consider both distributed space time code (DSTC) based simultaneous transmission and single relay selection based transmission from the relays. The exact expressions of the outage probabilities of different cooperative relaying schemes are derived for arbitrary number of relays and interference power constraint in Rayleigh fading environment. Results show that the single relay selection based schemes outperform the DSTC based scheme, in terms of both outage probability and implementation complexity, in multi-relay CR network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11678040","htmlLink":"/document/5645054/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative relaying in interference limited cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative relaying in interference limited cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p280asad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068392S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637454","isNumber":"5644846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637454","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5644846","articleId":"5645054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645056,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Liu","id":"37598766300"},{"name":"Kwonhue Choi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwonhue","lastName":"Choi","id":"38559978700"},{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Huaping Liu","id":"37310126400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7742-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7743-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7803-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7741-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"}],"articleNumber":"5645056","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","OFDM","Bandwidth","Complexity theory","MIMO","Coherence","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency selective surfaces","iterative methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM systems","lattice reduction","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency-selective fading channels","unimodular transformation matrix","amplitude correlation","brute-force LR iterations","adjacent subcarriers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency-selective channel","lattice reduction"]}],"abstract":"We propose a computationally efficient lattice reduction (LR) algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in frequency-selective fading channels.

This algorithm merges and splits hidden neurons during the training process of FNNs. Unlike most previous studies, AMSA puts emphasis on autonomous functioning in the design process of FNNs. This is the main reason why AMSA uses an adaptive not a predefined fixed strategy in designing FNNs. The adaptive strategy merges or splits hidden neurons based on the learning ability of hidden neurons or the training progress of FNNs. In order to reduce the amount of retraining after modifying FNN architectures, AMSA prunes hidden neurons by merging correlated hidden neurons and adds hidden neurons by splitting existing hidden neurons. In merge operation, the hidden neurons is merged based on mutual information criterion, resulting in compact neural networks architecture without decreasing the information processing capacity. In split operation, a new hidden neuron is added by splitting a hidden neuron in current neural networks, resulting in improve the information processing capacity. AMSA has been tested on the regression problem. The experimental results show that AMSA can design compact FNNs architectures with good generalization ability compared to other algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645080","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1272","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645080.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A merging and splitting algorithm based on mutual information for design neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive merging algorithm","splitting algorithm","mutual information criterion","neural networks architecture","learning capacity","optima feedforward neural networks","information processing capacity","regression problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedforward neural network (FNN)","Adaptive search strategy","Architecture design","Mutual information (MI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A merging and splitting algorithm based on mutual information for design neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645080/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684295","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A merging and splitting algorithm based on mutual information for design neural networks","confLoc":"Changsha","sourcePdf":"24007177d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072422S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5645087,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ghaffari","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghaffari","id":"37409198700"},{"name":"Farhad Nematy","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Farhad","lastName":"Nematy","id":"37601306300"},{"name":"Naeim Rahmani","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Naeim","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37547104200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645087","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645087","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","sensor placement","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redeployment","cluster heads","wireless sensor networks","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645087","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645087.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","startPage":"1180","endPage":"1184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redeployment of cluster heads in wireless sensor networks with genetic algorithm","abstract":"Since the appearance of wireless sensor networks, many researchers are challenging to improve its different parameters.

Experimental results show that our algorithm can increase coverage by relocating cluster heads to positions with more density of sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645087/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684416","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645087/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Redeployment of cluster heads in wireless sensor networks with genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redeployment of cluster heads in wireless sensor networks with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"22107146d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063152S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645094,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Bing","affiliation":["Col l. of Information & Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering Univ., China"],"lastName":"Yi-Bing"},{"name":"Rui Yang","affiliation":["Coll. of Information & Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China","Col l. of Information & Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering Univ., Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Rui Yang","id":"37596458500"},{"name":"Fang Ye","affiliation":["Coll. of Information & Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China","Col l. of Information & Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering Univ., Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Fang Ye","id":"37593305900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645094","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":871},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed cognitive radio networks","noncooperative spectrum allocation","game theory","multiNash equilibrium problem","spectrum sharing","cognitive users","iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum allocation","game theory","Nash equilibrium"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-cooperative spectrum allocation based on game theory in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","endPage":"1137","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645094.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645094","startPage":"1134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645094","abstract":"In this work, we use game theory to analyze the spectrum allocation problem of cognitive radio networks.

While the heterogeneous multi-core system offers substantial computation power with both lower cost and lower power consumption, its unconventional hardware architecture poses significant challenges to programmers for enabling existing applications to run efficiently on the system. Due to the complexity of applications, especially for MD applications, it is difficult to reorganize a new parallel schema for application to exploit task level parallelism on heterogeneous multi-core system during the application porting process. Instead of the common porting method that requires reorganizing the parallel schema of the application to accelerate the hotspots of the computation, a porting method which exploits task parallelism of MD software on heterogeneous multi-core system by substituting system-level communication library and remaining application's original parallel decomposition strategy unchanged was proposed in this paper. Besides preserving the integrity of the MD applications and avoiding additional cost of code modification, the experimental result of porting MD software named Moldy to IBM CBE architecture shows that the ported MD software based on our proposed porting method obtains both higher speedup ratio and higher performance.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645120","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645120.pdf","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Porting Molecular Dynamics simulation to heterogeneous multi-core architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645120/","displayDocTitle":"Porting Molecular Dynamics simulation to heterogeneous multi-core architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684459","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645120/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Porting Molecular Dynamics simulation to heterogeneous multi-core architecture","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"18507088gd.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.184195S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645136,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37600373400"},{"name":"Liang Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289059600"},{"name":"Xinyu Shao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Shao","id":"37286373100"},{"name":"Qing Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37595039000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645136","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645136","abstract":"In the modern manufacturing system, most jobs have a large number of flexible process plans.

Traditional algorithms merely aim at maximizing the overall network throughput, which may introduce the scheduling delay. Theoretically the model of relationship between link scheduling with the network throughput and end to end scheduling delay is analyzed. Then, a heuristic algorithm to solve the near optimal scheduling period and scheduling delay for link list with fixed schedule order is proposed. Furthermore, as the performance is much more effected by the scheduling sequence, the link scheduling scheme to sort the overall network link list based on NSGA-II is proposed. By choosing the optimal scheduling sequence, the ratio of the slot spatial reuse is enhanced, thus to increase the network throughput with the overall network scheduling delay is minimized.

Particle Swarm Optimization and its application to optimization calculation and analysis of energy-saving motor used in beam pumping unit","abstract":"In this paper, a new kind of quantum particle swarm algorithm for continuous space optimization is proposed, in which quantum computation is introduced into PSO. The particles can be described as superposition of multiple states. Quantum bits are updated by quantum rotation gates, and mutated by quantum non-gates. The numerical simulation results show that the new algorithm has better stability, global search capability and faster convergence rate than classical PSO and GA. Furthermore, the new algorithm is applied to the structure optimization of 37kW energy-saving motor used in beam pumping unit successfully. The main structure parameters of motor are selected as optimal variables. And the performance of motor is chosen as constraint conditions. Motor efficiency is selected as optimization goal. The optimized energy-saving motor, which is more energy efficient and materials saving, meets the requirements of periodic pulsating variable load, low load and energy saving in oil field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645153/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684448","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645153/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Continuous quantum Particle Swarm Optimization and its application to optimization calculation and analysis of energy-saving motor used in beam pumping unit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous quantum Particle Swarm Optimization and its application to optimization calculation and analysis of energy-saving motor used in beam pumping unit","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"23207162d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073843S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5645160,"authors":[{"name":"Dun-wei Gong","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Dun-wei","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269375200"},{"name":"Na-na Qin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Na-na Qin","id":"37602863600"},{"name":"Xiao-yan Sun","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-yan Sun","id":"37276409700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645160","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary optimization algorithm","multiobjective optimization problems","interval parameters","benchmark optimization problems","IP-MOEA","vector-evaluated genetic algorithm","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-objective optimization","interval","evolutionary optimization","dominance relation","crowding distance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645160","abstract":"Multi-objective optimization problems with interval parameters are a kind of complicated optimization problems that are popular in real-world applications and hard to be effectively solved.

We introduce a new mobile molecular robot with polymer or triad interactions acting among individual molecules, taking the responsibilities for embodying its structure and determining where further units can legally be attached and detached. We design a hybrid mechanism for the shape formation. The attachment and detachment of each robot is realized by morphogenetic properties of molecular cells, and the shape formation is controlled by cellular automata. Development of morphological features such as the formation of fine particles, cracks in particles, hollow particles, good or poor replication of the original catalyst particle shape, and the evolution of the porous structure of polymer particle are used as illustrative examples.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645171","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645171.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Bio-inspired automatic shape formation for swarms of self-reconfigurable modular robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645171/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Bio-inspired automatic shape formation for swarms of self-reconfigurable modular robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684408","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Bio-inspired automatic shape formation for swarms of self-reconfigurable modular robots","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"08804064d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021699S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","articleId":"5645171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5645181,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Shen","affiliation":["College of Physics Science and Technology, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China","Key Laboratory of Industrial Informatics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China","Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hai Shen","id":"37087566838"},{"name":"Li Jin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Industrial Informatics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Li Jin","id":"37087025002"},{"name":"Yunlong Zhu","affiliation":["Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yunlong Zhu","id":"37087251073"},{"name":"Zhu Zhu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Zhu Zhu","id":"37087347763"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645181","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Immune system","Quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","k-mean algorithm","clustering analysis","unsupervised classification technique","pattern recognition","hybrid algorithm","fitness function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clustering","particle swarm optimization","K-Means"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645181","abstract":"Clustering is an unsupervised classification technique which deals with pattern recognition problems.

For each process, longer detection time may result in fewer opportunities for cognitive radios to fill in spectrum holes, while shorter sensing time may make cognitive radios miss the chance to detect the presence of primary users which will bring harmful interference to primary users. However, to make sure the detection time has a great relationship with the prior probability of the existence of the primary user in authorized channel, a general and universal authorized channel model is needed for cognitive radios' spectrum detection. In this paper, the duration of primary user's presence and absence is modeled as an exponential distribution, and energy detection method is adopted to detect the channel modeled above. By Monte Carlo simulation, we obtain that the receiver operating characteristic curves for the modeled channel is very similar with the theoretical curve. Therefore, the model is very effective for analyzing the performance of the spectrum detection algorithms in cognitive radio networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","startPage":"551","endPage":"554","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645184.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum detection model for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645184/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum detection model for cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684331","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum detection model for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"10104087d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051793S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645198,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Sun","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yang Sun","id":"37597396300"},{"name":"Lingbo Zhang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lingbo Zhang","id":"37280183200"},{"name":"Xingsheng Gu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xingsheng Gu","id":"37276603800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645198","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Biomembranes","Computational modeling","Skin","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocomputing","fuel processing industries","least squares approximations","particle swarm optimisation","support vector machines","syngas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["membrane computing","particle swarm optimization algorithm","intelligent heuristic algorithms","MCBPSO","mutation strategy","LS-SVM","soft sensor modelling","Texaco gasifier syngas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["global optimization","particle swarm optimization","membrane computing","Texaco gasifier","syngas compositions","soft sensor","least squares support vector machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645198","abstract":"Intelligent heuristic algorithms have been paid more and more attention in solving large-scale, complex optimization problems.

Considering the features of membrane computing and PSO, a hybrid algorithm MCBPSO is proposed in this paper. In MCBPSO, PSO is introduced into the computing model of membrane system. Meanwhile, cooperation and mutation strategy are also established in the hybrid algorithm to improve the performance. The mechanism of cooperation can help the algorithm improving the efficiency. Mutation operations help the algorithm to jump out of local minima and improve the precision. An application of MCBPSO is also presented. MCBPSO and LS-SVM are used together in soft sensor modelling of the components of Texaco gasifier syngas.

The input data of CMAC neural network are the current smart component output and the output rate, the output of neural network is smart component input. The inverse hysteresis model of GMM smart component is achieved by CMAC network on-line learning.

The aim of this paper is to introduce the basic theoretical principles of electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm and design a new neural network model for tourism forecasting which uses the EM algorithm as the learning rule (EMNN). The EMNN is applied to two major tourism demand forecasting methods-econometrical model and time series analysis. In numerical experiment, this study tests the accuracy of EMNN model and compares the EMNN model with other traditional forecasting models, such as moving average (MV) and multiple regressions (MR). We also compares EMNN model with artificial intelligence approaches, for instance, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model and basic feed-forward neural networks model. Based on the experimental results, we can see that the EMNN model owns excellent performance in forecasting tourist arrivals.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645207","startPage":"679","endPage":"688","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645207.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training neural networks by electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithm for tourism arrivals forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645207/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Training neural networks by electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithm for tourism arrivals forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645207/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684350","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training neural networks by electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithm for tourism arrivals forecasting","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"12406009d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06387S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645210,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Hongbin Zhao","id":"37087493603"},{"name":"Lin Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Lin Zhao","id":"37087394296"},{"name":"Ming Sun","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Ming Sun","id":"37087221900"},{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Daqing Oilfield Mining Community Service Department, No.2 Real Estate Management Company, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhen Wang","id":"37087257839"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645210","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645210","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","asymptotic stability","feedback","neural nets","optimisation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic neural networks","nonlinear Gauss wavelet self-feedback","optimization","Gauss wavelet self-feedback","local approximation","asymptotical stability","linear self-feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chaotic neural network","wavelet","asymptotical stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645210","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645210.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","startPage":"698","endPage":"702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic neural networks with Gauss wavelet self-feedback and their applications to optimization","abstract":"This paper proposes chaotic neural networks with nonlinear Gauss wavelet self-feedback.

The algorithm's initial clustering centers are the stochastic selection which causes it to depend on the selection of the initial cluster centers excessively.

In order to overcome those defects, the fuzzy C-means cluster segmentation algorithm based on hybridized particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the hybridized particle swarm algorithm is used to get the initial cluster centers. Then, the images are segmented using standard FCM algorithm.

As the power energy limits the distance that each camera can move, the coverage problem is a constrained optimization. We provide three particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms for the problem, which are the penalty PSO, the absorbing PSO, and the reflecting PSO. The penalty PSO adds penalty to the coverage when a camera violates the distance constraint, while the last two PSO algorithms use the feasibility operators. By the absorbing PSO, the cameras out of the distance limit will stay at the boundary of the limit, while by the reflecting PSO their locations are randomly reinitialize into the feasible area. The three PSO algorithms are tested on the benchmarks, and the statistical analysis shows that their performance is in the descendant order of absorbing PSO, penalty PSO, and reflecting PSO. The results suggest that the absorbing PSO is a good choice for the coverage problem of camera networks.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645229","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645229.pdf","startPage":"816","endPage":"820","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three particle swarm algorithms to improve coverage of camera networks with mobile nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Three particle swarm algorithms to improve coverage of camera networks with mobile nodes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11684383","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645229/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three particle swarm algorithms to improve coverage of camera networks with mobile nodes","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"14607012d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077776S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5645234,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Yan","affiliation":["College of Business and Administration, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Sun Yan","id":"37087328207"},{"name":"Wang Wanliang","affiliation":["School of Software, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wang Wanliang","id":"37087277402"},{"name":"Liu Xiaojian","affiliation":["School of Art, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiaojian","id":"37603316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645234","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645234","abstract":"Regarding the fatigue problem in the interactive genetic algorithms (IGA) during the user's evaluation process, the paper proposed a Boolean evaluation method, which replaces user's grading work with selection.

User image helps to estimate individual's sufficiency. User sensitivity parameters help to arrange the searching order while layered optimizing method is adopted, and can also decide which dimensions of the searching space can be neglected according to the preset threshold value.

However, the PSO suffers on large execution times, and this fact becomes evident when using Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) microprocessors in which the operational frequencies are low in comparison with the high operational frequencies of traditional personal computers (PCs). This paper compares two hardware implementations of the parallel PSO algorithm using an efficient floating-point arithmetic which perform computations with large dynamic range and high precision. The full-parallel and the partially-parallel PSO architectures allow the parallel capabilities of the PSO to be exploited in order to decrease the running time. Three well-known benchmark test functions have been used to validate the hardware architectures and a comparison in terms of cost in logic area, quality of the solution and performance is reported.

This paper is concentrated on two main contributions.

The difference between competing systems is in the training set, which the frequency of samples that are \u201chard to recognize\u201d were become higher in boosted classifiers. In addition, two rejection strategies were proposed and evaluated to find out \u201chard to recognize\u201d samples. The experiments were conducted on extended IFH-CDB test database. The results reveal a very high accuracy classifier outperforming most of the previous systems. The achieved result shows 99.17% in recognition rate.

The Shuffled Frog Leaping algorithm (SFLA) is a stochastic iterative method, bio-inspired on the memetic evolution of a group of frogs when seeking for food, which combines the social behavior-based of the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) and the global information exchange of memetic algorithms. However, the SFLA algorithm suffers on large execution times, being this problem clearly evident when solving complex optimization problems for embedded applications. This drawback can be overcome by exploiting the parallel capabilities of the SFLA. This paper proposes a hardware parallel implementation of the SFLA algorithm (HPSFLA) using FPGAs (Field Programmable gate Arrays) and the efficient floating-point arithmetic. The proposed architecture allows the SFLA to improve the functionality of the algorithm as well as to decrease the execution times by implementing parallel frogs and parallel memeplexes. Three well-known benchmark problems have been used to validate the implemented algorithm and simulation results demonstrate that the HPSFLA speeds-up by factors of 362, 727 and 211 a C-code implementation using an embedded microprocessor for the Sphere, Rastrigin and Rosenbrock benchmarks problems, respectively. Synthesis, simulation and execution time results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HPSFLA architecture for embedded optimization systems.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645270","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645270.pdf","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating the Shuffled Frog Leaping algorithm by parallel implementations in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645270/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the Shuffled Frog Leaping algorithm by parallel implementations in FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645270/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684502","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the Shuffled Frog Leaping algorithm by parallel implementations in FPGAs","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"27949d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074485S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645280,"authors":[{"name":"Kusum Deep","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Deep","id":"37598145400"},{"name":"Sunita Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Sunita","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37589200800"},{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Department of Paper Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Millie","lastName":"Pant","id":"37603464400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645280","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Ions","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Numerical models","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","benchmark testing","evolutionary computation","message passing","parallel algorithms","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel particle swarm optimization","global optimization","message passing interface","heuristic technique","global optimal solution","nonlinear optimization","evolutionary algorithm","population based method","benchmark scalable test problem","graphical analysis","parallel algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm algorithms","global optimization","parallel algorithms","message passing interface (MPI)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645280","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645280.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified parallel particle swarm optimization for global optimization using Message Passing Interface","abstract":"PSO has emerged as a powerful heuristic technique for determining the global optimal solution of nonlinear optimization problems.

We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for game solving and other \u201creal world\u201d problems.","doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645284","startPage":"1417","endPage":"1423","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645284.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and the art of Zen","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645284/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and the art of Zen","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645284/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684516","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and the art of Zen","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"26429d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056833S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645288,"authors":[{"name":"Song Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Song Yang","id":"37087574760"},{"name":"Ji Junzhong","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ji Junzhong","id":"37087533355"},{"name":"Liu Chunnian","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Liu Chunnian","id":"37087534979"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645288","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["component-emphasizing mechanism","multiobjective optimization","industrial design","scientific research","multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","Pareto optimal set","trial solutions","decision vector","search ability","NSGA-II","GDE3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MOEA","elite population","steady-state strategy","component-emphasizing mechanism"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645288","pdfPath":"/iel5/5629467/5645057/05645288.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)","startPage":"380","endPage":"384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing MOEA with component-emphasizing mechanism for multi-objective optimization","abstract":"Multi-objective optimization is an important and challenging topic in the field of industrial design and scientific research because real-world problems usually involve several conflicting objectives. Since a multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) is able to obtain an approximation to the Pareto optimal set and provide substantial information of the tradeoff between objectives, it is becoming one of the most successful methods for multi-objective optimization. Usually, an MOEA generates new trial solutions (offspring) with some candidate decision vectors (parents) to search for the promising areas and make the population evolve towards the Pareto optimal set. Moreover, in the reproduction procedure, most of MOEAs view the decision vector as a whole, and do not recognize the effects of a single component on the new trial solutions. In this paper, we propose the component-emphasizing mechanism for enhancing the search ability of MOEAs. In this mechanism, each component of a decision vector is viewed as an independent factor affecting the quality of the solution. Based on the mechanism, a new MOEA is presented. Finally, the performance of this new algorithm is compared with two other promising MOEAs, namely, NSGA-II and GDE3, on a set of test instances. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others in solution quality and time cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645288/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684520","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645288/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhancing MOEA with component-emphasizing mechanism for multi-objective optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing MOEA with component-emphasizing mechanism for multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Changsha","sourcePdf":"07104038d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071384S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5629467","isNumber":"5645057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5629467","xplore-issue":"5645057","articleId":"5645288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5645291,"authors":[{"name":"Tiejun Zhou","affiliation":["College of Science, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Tiejun Zhou","id":"37087513096"},{"name":"Ming Wang","affiliation":["College of Science, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Ming Wang","id":"37087531547"},{"name":"Haiquan Fang","affiliation":["College of Science, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Haiquan Fang","id":"37087534695"},{"name":"Xiaoqun Li","affiliation":["College of Orient Science & Technology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqun","lastName":"Li","id":"38560355600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645291","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","content-addressable storage","delays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global exponential stability","bidirectional associative memory neural network model","mathematical model","multidirectional associative memory neural networks","MAM neural networks","constant time delays","Brouwer fixed point theorem","upper right Dini derivative","sufficient and necessary condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multidirectional associative memory","global exponential stability","equilibrium"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645291","abstract":"By extending the bidirectional associative memory neural network model, a mathematical model of multidirectional associative memory (MAM) neural networks with constant time delays is proposed.

However, it remains a challenge for software engineers to hand-craft a utility function that achieves both a high precision (i.e., few false alarms) and a high recall (i.e., few undetected faults). This paper describes a technique that uses genetic programming to automatically evolve a utility function for a specific system, set of resource usage metrics, and precision/recall preference. These metrics are computed using sensor values that monitor a variety of system resources (e.g., memory usage, processor usage, thread count). The technique allows users to specify the relative importance of precision and recall, and builds a utility function to meet those requirements. We evaluated the technique on the open source Jigsaw web server using ten resource usage metrics and five anomalous behaviors in the form of injected faults in the Jigsaw code and a security attack. To assess the effectiveness of the technique, the precision and recall of the evolved utility function was compared to that of a hand-crafted utility function that uses a simple thresholding scheme. The results show that the evolved function outperformed the hand-crafted function by 10 percent.","doi":"10.1109/WCRE.2010.23","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644814/5645441/05645446.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCRE.2010.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse Engineering Utility Functions Using Genetic Programming to Detect Anomalous Behavior in Software","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reverse Engineering Utility Functions Using Genetic Programming to Detect Anomalous Behavior in Software","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11675922","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645446/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse Engineering Utility Functions Using Genetic Programming to Detect Anomalous Behavior in Software","confLoc":"Beverly, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4123a141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082016S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644814","isNumber":"5645441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644814","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5645441","articleId":"5645446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5645454,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Giampapa","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

To achieve petascale computing two broad approaches for kernels were taken, a lightweight approach embodied by IBM Blue Gene's CNK, and a more fullweight approach embodied by Cray's CNL. There are strengths and weaknesses to each approach. Examining the current generation can provide insight as to what mechanisms may be needed for the exascale generation. The contributions of this paper are the experiences we had with CNK on Blue Gene/P. We demonstrate it is possible to implement a small lightweight kernel that scales well but still provides a Linux environment and functionality desired by HPC programmers. Such an approach provides the values of reproducibility, low noise, high and stable performance, reliability, and ease of effectively exploiting unique hardware features.

Our analytical model shows that not only collective operations but also point-to-point communications influence the application's sensitivity to noise. We present a simulation toolchain that injects noise delays from traces gathered on common large-scale architectures into a LogGPS simulation and allows new insights into the scaling of applications in noisy environments. We investigate collective operations with up to 1 million processes and three applications (Sweep3D, AMG, and POP) with up to 32,000 processes.We show that the scale at which noise becomes a bottleneck is system-specific and depends on the structure of the noise. Simulations with different network speeds show that a 10x faster network does not improve application scalability. We quantify noise and conclude that our tools can be utilized to tune the noise signatures of a specific system.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International

advancements in CMOS technology trend toward ever increasing core counts in chip multiprocessors for high-performance embedded computing, the discrepancy between on- and off-chip communication bandwidth continues to widen due to the power and spatial constraints of electronic off-chip signaling. Silicon photonics-based communication offers many advantages over electronics for network-on-chip design, namely power consumption that is effectively agnostic to distance traveled at the chip- and board-scale, even across chip boundaries. In this work we develop a design for a photonic network-on-chip with integrated DRAM I/O interfaces and compare its performance to similar electronic solutions using a detailed network-on-chip simulation. When used in a circuit-switched network, silicon nanophotonic switches offer higher bandwidth density and low power transmission, adding up to over 10x better performance and 3-5x lower power over the baseline for projective transform, matrix multiply, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), all key algorithms in embedded real-time signal and image processing.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2010.13","publicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644813/5644843/05645460.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2010.13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-Switched Memory Access in Photonic Interconnection Networks for High-Performance Embedded Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-Switched Memory Access in Photonic Interconnection Networks for High-Performance Embedded Computing","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11675895","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645460/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-Switched Memory Access in Photonic Interconnection Networks for High-Performance Embedded Computing","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105902S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5645460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645463,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Nguyen","affiliation":["Throughput Computing Laboratory, Intel Corporation, China"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38181758300"},{"name":"Nadathur Satish","affiliation":["Throughput Computing Laboratory, Intel Corporation, China"],"firstName":"Nadathur","lastName":"Satish","id":"37391797900"},{"name":"Jatin Chhugani","affiliation":["Throughput Computing Laboratory, Intel Corporation, China"],"firstName":"Jatin","lastName":"Chhugani","id":"37275779800"},{"name":"Changkyu Kim","affiliation":["Throughput Computing Laboratory, Intel Corporation, China"],"firstName":"Changkyu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37578251700"},{"name":"Pradeep Dubey","affiliation":["Throughput Computing Laboratory, Intel Corporation, China"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Dubey","id":"37356156800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7559-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7557-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7558-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"5645463","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":143,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1037},"abstract":"Stencil computation sweeps over a spatial grid over multiple time steps to perform nearest-neighbor computations. The bandwidth-to-compute requirement for a large class of stencil kernels is very high, and their performance is bound by the available memory bandwidth. Since memory bandwidth grows slower than compute, the performance of stencil kernels will not scale with increasing compute density. We present a novel 3.5D-blocking algorithm that performs 2.5D-spatial and temporal blocking of the input grid into on-chip memory for both CPUs and GPUs. The resultant algorithm is amenable to both thread- level and data-level parallelism, and scales near-linearly with the SIMD width and multiple-cores. Our performance numbers are faster or comparable to state-of-the-art-stencil implementations on CPUs and GPUs. Our implementation of 7-point-stencil is 1.5X-faster on CPUs, and 1.8X faster on GPUs for single- precision floating point inputs than previously reported numbers. For Lattice Boltzmann methods, the corresponding speedup number on CPUs is 2.1X.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Memory

We evaluate several approaches to integrating these memories into computer systems by measuring their impact on IO-intensive, database, and memory-intensive applications. We explore several options for connecting solid-state storage to the host system and find that the memories deliver large gains in sequential and random access performance, but that different system organizations lead to different performance trade-offs. The memories provide substantial application-level gains as well, but overheads in the OS, file system, and application can limit performance. As a result, fully exploiting these memories' potential will require substantial changes to application and system software. Finally, paging to fast non-volatile memories is a viable option for some applications, providing an alternative to expensive, powerhungry DRAM for supporting scientific applications with large memory footprints.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2010.56","publicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644813/5644843/05645465.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2010.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Impact of Emerging Non-Volatile Memories on High-Performance, IO-Intensive Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Impact of Emerging Non-Volatile Memories on High-Performance, IO-Intensive Computing","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645465/","accessionNumber":"11675900","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Impact of Emerging Non-Volatile Memories on High-Performance, IO-Intensive Computing","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128449S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5645465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5645467,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Dong","affiliation":["Exascale Computing Laboratory, Hewlett Packard Laboratories, USA","Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37407343000"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"},{"name":"Naveen Muralimanohar","affiliation":["Exascale Computing Laboratory, Hewlett Packard Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Muralimanohar","id":"37391840200"},{"name":"Norman P.

This paper describes the techniques used to mitigate latency in Anton, a massively parallel special-purpose machine that accelerates molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by orders of magnitude compared with the previous state of the art. Achieving this speedup required a combination of hardware mechanisms and software constructs to reduce network latency, sender and receiver overhead, and synchronization costs. Key elements of Anton's approach, in addition to tightly integrated communication hardware, include formulating data transfer in terms of counted remote writes, leveraging fine-grained communication, and establishing fixed, optimized communication patterns. Anton delivers software-to-software inter-node latency significantly lower than any other large-scale parallel machine, and the total critical-path communication time for an Anton MD simulation is less than 4% that of the next fastest MD platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644813/5644843/05645468.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"SC '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","doi":"10.1109/SC.2010.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2010.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting 162-Nanosecond End-to-End Communication Latency on Anton","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Synchronization","Radiation detectors","Hardware","Software","Force","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","electronic data interchange","molecular biophysics","molecular dynamics method","parallel architectures","parallel machines","scientific information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end communication latency","scientific application","parallel architecture","Anton machine","parallel special-purpose machine","molecular dynamics simulation","hardware mechanism","network latency","sender overhead","receiver overhead","synchronization cost","communication hardware","data transfer","counted remote write","fine-grained communication","optimized communication pattern","software-to-software internode latency","large-scale parallel machine","critical-path communication time","Anton MD simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting 162-Nanosecond End-to-End Communication Latency on Anton","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645468/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675903","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting 162-Nanosecond End-to-End Communication Latency on Anton","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"75590019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.181291S","chronDate":"13-19 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644813","isNumber":"5644843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644813","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5644843","articleId":"5645468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645479,"authors":[{"name":"Dawn Lawrie","affiliation":["Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Lawrie","id":"37599910700"},{"name":"Dave Binkley","affiliation":["Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Binkley","id":"37275658000"},{"name":"Christopher Morrell","affiliation":["Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Morrell","id":"37599911500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8911-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5369"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-1350"}],"articleNumber":"5645479","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Measurement","Google","Vocabulary","Software","Documentation","Natural languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","natural languages","software engineering","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source code vocabulary normalization","information retrieval","software artifact","GenTest","natural language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["source code analysis tools","information retrieval","program comprehension"]}],"abstract":"Information Retrieval (IR) based tools complement traditional static and dynamic analysis tools by exploiting the natural language found within a program's text. Tools incorporating IR have tackled problems, such as feature location, that previously required considerable human effort. However, to reap the full benefit of IR-based techniques, the language used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirement and design documents, test plans, as well as the source code) must be consistent. Vocabulary normalization aligns the vocabulary found in source code with that found in other software artifacts. Normalization both splits an identifier into its constituent parts and expands each part into a full dictionary word to match vocabulary in other artifacts. An algorithm for normalization is presented. Its current implementation incorporates a greatly improved splitter that exploits a collection of resources including several dictionaries, frequency distributions derived from the corpus of programs, and co-occurrence data. Empirical study of this new splitter, GenTest, on almost 8000 identifiers finds that it correctly splits 82%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art. A preliminary experiment with the normalization algorithm finds it improving the FLAT \u0302 3 feature locator's scores of relevant code from 0.60 to 0.95 on a scale from 0 to 1.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalizing Source Code Vocabulary","publicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","doi":"10.1109/WCRE.2010.10","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644814/5645441/05645479.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCRE.2010.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Normalizing Source Code Vocabulary","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645479/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalizing Source Code Vocabulary","confLoc":"Beverly, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4123a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141428S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644814","isNumber":"5645441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644814","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5645441","articleId":"5645479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-17"},{"_id":5645482,"authors":[{"name":"Sonia Haiduc","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Haiduc","id":"37600721300"},{"name":"Jairo Aponte","affiliation":["Department de Ingenieria de Sistemas e Industrial, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jairo","lastName":"Aponte","id":"37600703000"},{"name":"Laura Moreno","affiliation":["Department de Ingenieria de Sistemas e Industrial, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37587470800"},{"name":"Andrian Marcus","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Andrian","lastName":"Marcus","id":"37267346800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8911-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5369"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-1350"}],"articleNumber":"5645482","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":128,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Large scale integration","Semantics","Software systems","Computer science","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated text summarization technique","textual description","software entity","source code summarization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["text summarization","program comprehension"]}],"abstract":"During maintenance developers cannot read the entire code of large systems. They need a way to get a quick understanding of source code entities (such as, classes, methods, packages, etc.), so they can efficiently identify and then focus on the ones related to their task at hand. Sometimes reading just a method header or a class name does not tell enough about its purpose and meaning, while reading the entire implementation takes too long. We study a solution which mitigates the two approaches, i.e., short and accurate textual descriptions that illustrate the software entities without having to read the details of the implementation. We create such descriptions using techniques from automatic text summarization. The paper presents a study that investigates the suitability of various such techniques for generating source code summaries. The results indicate that a combination of text summarization techniques is most appropriate for source code summarization and that developers generally agree with the summaries produced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Automated Text Summarization Techniques for Summarizing Source Code","publicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","doi":"10.1109/WCRE.2010.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644814/5645441/05645482.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCRE.2010.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Automated Text Summarization Techniques for Summarizing Source Code","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645482/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675934","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Automated Text Summarization Techniques for Summarizing Source Code","confLoc":"Beverly, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4123a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08991S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644814","isNumber":"5645441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644814","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5645441","articleId":"5645482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5645534,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano K.

Migration to many-core architectures and in particular the development of GPUs make realtime applications possible. This work aims at improving the performance of ray tracing with support for anti-aliasing using image processing techniques implemented in GPU. The results show considerable gains with the use of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Ray Tracing Anti-aliasing Performance through Image Gradient Analysis","publicationTitle":"2010 11th Symposium on Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/WSCAD-SCC.2010.18","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 11th Symposium on Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644812/5644965/05645536.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSCAD-SCC.2010.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644965","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improving Ray Tracing Anti-aliasing Performance through Image Gradient Analysis","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645536/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675847","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Ray Tracing Anti-aliasing Performance through Image Gradient Analysis","confLoc":"Petropolis, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4274a144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083673S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644812","isNumber":"5644965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644812","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5644965","articleId":"5645536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5645567,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh H.D.

However, all too often the data stored in issue tracking repositories is not explicitly tagged or linked to source code. Researchers have to resort to heuristics to tag the data (e.g., to determine if an issue is a bug report or a work item), or to link a piece of code to a particular issue or bug. Recent studies by Bird et al. and by Antoniol et al. suggest that software models based on imperfect datasets with missing links to the code and incorrect tagging of issues, exhibit biases that compromise the validity and generality of the quality models built on top of the datasets. In this study, we verify the effects of such biases for a commercial project that enforces strict development guidelines and rules on the quality of the data in its issue tracking repository. Our results show that even in such a perfect setting, with a near-ideal dataset, biases do exist - leading us to conjecture that biases are more likely a symptom of the underlying software development process instead of being due to the used heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/WCRE.2010.37","publicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5644814/5645441/05645567.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCRE.2010.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case Study of Bias in Bug-Fix Datasets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645567/","displayDocTitle":"A Case Study of Bias in Bug-Fix Datasets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675918","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645567/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case Study of Bias in Bug-Fix Datasets","confLoc":"Beverly, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4123a259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062519S","chronDate":"13-16 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5644814","isNumber":"5645441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5644814","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5645441","articleId":"5645567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5645606,"authors":[{"name":"Kusum Deep","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Deep","id":"37598145400"},{"name":"Jagdish Chand Bansal","affiliation":["ABV Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish Chand","lastName":"Bansal","id":"37604735600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6440-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6437-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6439-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5645606","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power system economics","valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic dispatch problems","valve-point effects","Laplace crossover particle swarm optimization","power system operations","continuous optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Economic Dispatch","Laplace Crossover"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645606","abstract":"Laplace Crossover Particle Swarm Optimization (LXPSO) is a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which employs Laplace Crossover to PSO.

A particular technique for quantum error correction that may be useful for protecting a stream of quantum information is quantum convolutional coding. The encoder for a quantum convolutional code has a representation as a convolutional encoder or as a \"pearl-necklace\u201d encoder. In the pearl-necklace representation, it has not been particularly clear in the research literature how much quantum memory such an encoder would require for implementation. Here, we offer an algorithm that answers this question. The algorithm first constructs a weighted, directed acyclic graph where each vertex of the graph corresponds to a gate string in the pearl-necklace encoder, and each path through the graph represents a path through noncommuting gates in the encoder. We show that the weight of the longest path through the graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement the encoder. A dynamic programming search through this graph determines the longest path. The running time for the construction of the graph and search through it is quadratic in the number of gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6136474/05645613.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6136474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal-Memory Requirements for Pearl-Necklace Encoders of Quantum Convolutional Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Minimal-Memory Requirements for Pearl-Necklace Encoders of Quantum Convolutional Codes","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5645613/","accessionNumber":"12486978","volume":"61","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal-Memory Requirements for Pearl-Necklace Encoders of Quantum Convolutional Codes","sourcePdf":"ttc2012030299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081161S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6136474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6136474","articleId":"5645613","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-10"},{"_id":5645624,"authors":[{"name":"Varun Chandola","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA","Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6174514/5645624/5645624-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Varun Chandola received the PhD degree from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in 2009.

The objective is to provide a global understanding of the sequence anomaly detection problem and how existing techniques relate to each other. The key contribution of this survey is the classification of the existing research into three distinct categories, based on the problem formulation that they are trying to solve. These problem formulations are: 1) identifying anomalous sequences with respect to a database of normal sequences; 2) identifying an anomalous subsequence within a long sequence; and 3) identifying a pattern in a sequence whose frequency of occurrence is anomalous. We show how each of these problem formulations is characteristically distinct from each other and discuss their relevance in various application domains. We review techniques from many disparate and disconnected application domains that address each of these formulations. Within each problem formulation, we group techniques into categories based on the nature of the underlying algorithm. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and show how the existing techniques are variants of the basic technique. This approach shows how different techniques within a category are related or different from each other. Our categorization reveals new variants and combinations that have not been investigated before for anomaly detection. We also provide a discussion of relative strengths and weaknesses of different techniques. We show how techniques developed for one problem formulation can be adapted to solve a different formulation, thereby providing several novel adaptations to solve the different problem formulations. We also highlight the applicability of the techniques that handle discrete sequences to other related areas such as online anomaly detection and time series anomaly detection.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6174514/05645624.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6174514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection for Discrete Sequences: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection for Discrete Sequences: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645624/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12638768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645624/","volume":"24","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection for Discrete Sequences: A Survey","sourcePdf":"ttk2012050823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199341S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6174514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"340","xplore-issue":"6174514","articleId":"5645624","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5645634,"authors":[{"name":"Young-June Choi","affiliation":["Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5898460/5645634/5645634-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-June Choi received the BS, MS, and PhD degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, in 2000, 2002, and 2006, respectively.

This requires downlink channel information from the users that is opportunistically used by a base station to send data to the users with good channel condition. Channel feedback from the user to the base station incurs high overhead especially when many users are in the cell and each user needs to report channel information over multiple channels, as in OFDMA systems. To reduce the quantity of feedback information without significant throughput degradation, a practical strategy is to deliver feedback on a partial set of channels with the best channel quality. We call it best feedback, and this reporting scheme carried out for best four or five among 24 channels has been already adopted in the IEEE 802.16e standard. Considering real feedback conditions, we investigate the performance of a best feedback scheme and derive the optimal number of channels for which information needs to be fed back to keep the throughput gap (compared to a full feedback scheme) within a target margin. From the optimal condition, we propose an adaptive best feedback algorithm, where the number of reported channels is adjusted to adapt to the number of users in the cell. We also propose an adjusted periodic feedback algorithm, where users are divided into groups and scheduling is carried out group by group, so a user can report feedback information when his group is scheduled, thereby reducing the frequency of feedback transmission. To support differentiated performance, we further propose heterogeneous feedback algorithms where users are divided into heterogeneous groups, each with a different group size or a different feedback period. Numerical results validate our analysis and provide meaningful insights into the design of various channel feedback schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5898460/05645634.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Best Channel Feedback and Its Adaptive Algorithms for Multicarrier Wireless Data Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645634/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Best Channel Feedback and Its Adaptive Algorithms for Multicarrier Wireless Data Systems","volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12068903","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645634/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Best Channel Feedback and Its Adaptive Algorithms for Multicarrier Wireless Data Systems","sourcePdf":"ttm2011081071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081368S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5898460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5898460","articleId":"5645634","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645637,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electric Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5898460/5645637/5645637-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Gao received the BS degree in information engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2002, and the MS degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2006.

Market-driven spectrum auction has been recognized as an effective way to achieve DSA. In spectrum auction, the primary spectrum owners (POs) act as auctioneers who are willing to sell idle spectrum bands for additional revenue, and the secondary users (SUs) act as bidders who are willing to buy spectrum bands from POs for their services. However, conventional spectrum auction designs are restricted within the scenario of single auctioneer. In this paper, we study the spectrum auction with multiple auctioneers and multiple bidders, which is more realistic for practical CR networks. We propose MAP, a Multiauctioneer Progressive auction mechanism, in which each auctioneer systematically raises the trading price and each bidder subsequently chooses one auctioneer for bidding. The equilibrium is defined as the state that no auctioneer and bidder would like to change his decision. We show analytically that MAP converges to the equilibrium with maximum spectrum utilization of the whole system. We further analyze the incentive for POs and SUs joining the auction and accepting the auction result. Simulation results show that MAP well converges to the equilibrium, and the spectrum utilization is arbitrary closed to the global optimal solution according to the length of step.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAP: Multiauctioneer Progressive Auction for Dynamic Spectrum Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.220","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5898460/05645637.pdf","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"MAP: Multiauctioneer Progressive Auction for Dynamic Spectrum Access","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5645637/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12068905","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAP: Multiauctioneer Progressive Auction for Dynamic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"ttm2011081144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150451S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5898460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5898460","articleId":"5645637","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645641,"authors":[{"name":"Minh-Viet Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5752265/5645641/5645641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minh-Viet Nguyen received the BS degree from the Hanoi University of Technology (HUT), Vietnam, in 2003, and the MS and PhD degrees in 2006 and 2010, respectively, from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, all majoring in electrical engineering.

The PRN uses a set of licensed nonoverlapping orthogonal frequency channels for transmission. This set of channels is also accessed in an opportunistic manner by a set of cognitive radio base stations (CR-BSs) to support secondary users (SUs). The problem is formulated to maximize the spectrum utilization of SUs without causing excessive interference to active primary users (PUs) of the PRN. In addition, all the serviced SUs must meet a certain Quality of Service (QoS), such as satisfying a predefined signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). A centralized solution for joint scheduling and power control is derived to make the global accessing decision for all unserved SUs. With the assumption that the knowledge of all subscribers is available, a coordinator of the CRN can use the joint scheduling and power control algorithm to maximize the spectrum utilization of serviced SUs by solving a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with an NP-hard complexity. To avoid the NP-hard complexity, we propose a suboptimal heuristic greedy algorithm that can be obtained at a much lower complexity based on the coloring interference graph among unserved SUs effected by serviced SUs and active PUs. Its superior performance over the existing algorithms is demonstrated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5752265/05645641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5752265","startPage":"853","endPage":"867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Scheduling in Infrastructure-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effective Scheduling in Infrastructure-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11960626","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5645641/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Scheduling in Infrastructure-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011060853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128553S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5752265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5752265","articleId":"5645641","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645645,"authors":[{"name":"Asghar Gholami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Asghar Gholami Gholami was born in Isfahan, Iran in 1970.

The inherent property of materials to partially polarize the reflected light can serve as a tool to classify them. In this paper, a real-time polarization sensing CMOS image sensor using a wire grid polarizer is proposed. The image sensor consist of an array of 128 \u00d7 128 pixels, occupies an area of 5 \u00d7 4 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and it has been designed and fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. We show that this image sensor can be used to differentiate between metal and dielectric surfaces in real-time due to the different nature in partially polarizing the specular and diffuse reflection components of the reflected light. This is achieved by calculating the Fresnel reflection coefficients, the degree of polarization and the variations in the maximum and minimum transmitted intensities for varying specular angle of incidence. Differences in the physical parameters for various metal surfaces result in different surface reflection behavior, influencing the Fresnel reflection coefficients. It is also shown that the image sensor can differentiate among various metals by sensing the change in the polarization Fresnel ratio.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2095003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5772982/05645650.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2095003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Polarization Analyzing CMOS Image Sensor for Material Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645650/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Polarization Analyzing CMOS Image Sensor for Material Classification","volume":"11","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12021588","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645650/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Polarization Analyzing CMOS Image Sensor for Material Classification","sourcePdf":"jsen-sarkar-2095003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09619S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5772982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5772982","articleId":"5645650","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5645652,"authors":[{"name":"Attila Mekis","affiliation":["Luxtera, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5784182/5645652/5645652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Attila Mekis received the B.S. degree in physics from Yale University, New Haven, CT, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in theoretical condensed matter physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, in 2000.","He is currently a Principal Engineer at Luxtera, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, where he is engaged for the development of photonic device, as the company brings its CMOS photonic technology to the active optical cable market.

R-SOLNET forms self-aligned optical couplings between optical devices, which tolerate the mutual positional misalignment, and it also forms optical waveguides in a free space. We propose R-SOLNET in 3-D optical circuits for board/chip-level optical interconnects to reduce the amount of effort that is required for optical device assembly and vertical optical waveguide formation. We predicted by the finite-difference time-domain method that an optical Z-connection of R-SOLNET would vertically connect two 2-\u03bcm-core optical waveguide films stacked with a 10-\u03bcm gap. A self-aligned vertical waveguide is formed even when misalignment exists between the films.

The ball-coupling design has 15 \u03bcm backlash and induces a maximum of 8 \u03bcm of cross-axis motion.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2089043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5784182/05645655.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2089043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Axis MEMS Lens Alignment System for Free-Space Optical Interconnect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645655/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Axis MEMS Lens Alignment System for Free-Space Optical Interconnect","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 2011","accessionNumber":"12036155","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645655/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Axis MEMS Lens Alignment System for Free-Space Optical Interconnect","sourcePdf":"jstqe-yoxall-2089043-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1189S","chronDate":"May-June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5784182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5784182","articleId":"5645655","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5645658,"authors":[{"name":"Do-Gu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kyonggi University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Do-Gu","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085335708"},{"name":"Y.

The power quality standards and the system resonances burden the task. In order to deal with resonances, system damping has to be implemented. Active damping is preferred to passive damping so as to improve the efficiency of the conversion. In addition, paralleled grid-connected inverters in photovoltaic (PV) plants are coupled due to grid impedance. Generally, this coupling is not taken into account when designing the control laws. In consequence, depending on the number of paralleled grid-connected inverters and the grid impedance, the inverters installed in PV plants do not behave as expected. In this paper, the inverters of a PV plant are modeled as a multivariable system. The analysis carried out enables to obtain an equivalent inverter that describes the totality of inverters of a PV plant. The study is validated through simulation and field experiments. The coupling effect is described and the control law design of paralleled grid-connected inverters with LCL filters in PV plants is clarified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","volume":"26","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12004912","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5645691/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$N$</tex> </formula>-Paralleled Grid-Connected Inverters With LCL Filter Coupled Due to Grid Impedance in PV Plants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$N$</tex> </formula>-Paralleled Grid-Connected Inverters With LCL Filter Coupled Due to Grid Impedance in PV Plants","sourcePdf":"tpel-agorreta-2095429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132435S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"412","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5645691","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5645692,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Duan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5767815/5645692/5645692-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pan Duan was born in Chongqing, China, in 1985.

For the microgrid, the faults in the wind generation system usually result in the power accidents. The open switch fault of wind power converter is one of the faults, and many diagnosing methods have been developed. To avoid the disadvantages of current open-switch fault diagnosing methods for a doubly fed wind power converter, an anti-false-alarm method, which can detect one or two open switch faults is proposed in the paper, which is based on the investigation of the characteristics of current signals. Simulations were carried out to test the method presented in the paper, and results indicate the diagnosing method cannot only detect one open switch fault, also two open switch faults at the same time. In addition, the false alarm caused by the open switch fault at the rotor side can be avoided. Finally, a system reconfiguration topology was designed to keep the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) continue running after the open switch faults. Simulation results show that the method can detect the locations and styles of open switch faults precisely, and the system reconfiguration strategy can restart the DFIG rapidly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5645692/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12004913","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Open-switch fault diagnosis and system reconfiguration of doubly fed wind power converter used in a microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-switch fault diagnosis and system reconfiguration of doubly fed wind power converter used in a microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpel-duan-2095470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061452S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5645692","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5645693,"authors":[{"name":"Haihua Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5767815/5645693/5645693-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haihua Zhou (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Zhejiang University, China, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 2005.

Usage of energy storage becomes mandatory when such microgrids are used to supply quality power to the loads. Microgrids have two modes of operation, namely, grid-connected and islanding modes. During islanding mode, the main responsibility of the storage is to perform energy balance. During grid-connected mode, the goal is to prevent propagation of the renewable source intermittency and load fluctuations to the grid. Energy storage of a single type cannot perform all these jobs efficiently in a renewable powered microgrid. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) demands usage of storage with high energy density. At the same time, quick fluctuation of load demands storage with high power density. This paper proposes a composite energy storage system (CESS) that contains both high energy density storage battery and high power density storage ultracapacitor to meet the aforementioned requirements. The proposed power converter configuration and the energy management scheme can actively distribute the power demand among the different energy storages. Results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05645693.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite Energy Storage System Involving Battery and Ultracapacitor With Dynamic Energy Management in Microgrid Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Composite Energy Storage System Involving Battery and Ultracapacitor With Dynamic Energy Management in Microgrid Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645693/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12004914","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5645693/","volume":"26","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Energy Storage System Involving Battery and Ultracapacitor With Dynamic Energy Management in Microgrid Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhou-2095040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070611S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"467","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5645693","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5645694,"authors":[{"name":"Taghi M.

Noise and class imbalance are two well-established data characteristics encountered in a wide range of data mining and machine learning initiatives. The learning algorithms studied in this paper, which include SMOTEBoost, RUSBoost, Exactly Balanced Bagging, and Roughly Balanced Bagging, combine boosting or bagging with data sampling to make them more effective when data are imbalanced. These techniques are evaluated in a comprehensive suite of experiments, for which nearly four million classification models were trained. All classifiers are assessed using seven different performance metrics, providing a complete perspective on the performance of these techniques, and results are tested for statistical significance via analysis-of-variance modeling. The experiments show that the bagging techniques generally outperform boosting, and hence in noisy data environments, bagging is the preferred method for handling class imbalance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645694/","volume":"41","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5645694/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11944405","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Boosting and Bagging Techniques With Noisy and Imbalanced Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Boosting and Bagging Techniques With Noisy and Imbalanced Data","sourcePdf":"tsmca-khoshgoftaar-2084081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185987S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5749780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5749780","articleId":"5645694","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5645700,"authors":[{"name":"Le Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Cao","id":"37678423400"},{"name":"Pooi-Yuen Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pooi-Yuen","lastName":"Kam","id":"37280044700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5645700","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645700","abstract":"With imperfect channel state information (CSI) acquired by channel estimation at the receiver, the performance of basic automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) systems is evaluated as a function of the accuracy of channel estimation. A link between data-link-layer performances and physical-layer parameters is therefore established. Upper and lower bounds on the accepted packet error rate (APER), the goodput, and the drop rate are derived. These upper and lower bounds are close to one another and therefore enable the behavior of the exact performance parameters to be investigated. The results show that the effect of the MSE on the system performance is nonlinear. At high values of the MSE, the performance very rapidly deteriorates, whereas, at low values of the MSE, the performance gently improves toward that of the perfect CSI case. The study here shows how accurate the CSI should be to achieve a specified performance level in ARQ schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2095471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713041","startPage":"704","endPage":"709","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05645700.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2095471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Packet ARQ Schemes in Rayleigh Fading: The Role of Receiver Channel State Information and Its Accuracy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Channel estimation","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Error probability","Diversity reception","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel estimation","error statistics","mean square error methods","Rayleigh channels","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic-repeat-request","packet ARQ","Rayleigh fading","receiver channel state information","channel estimation","data link layer performance","physical-layer parameters","accepted packet error rate","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accepted packet error rate (APER)","automatic-repeat-request (ARQ)","channel estimation","goodput","imperfect channel state information (CSI)","normalized MSE (NMSE)","Rayleigh fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Packet ARQ Schemes in Rayleigh Fading: The Role of Receiver Channel State Information and Its Accuracy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5645700/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11807405","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Packet ARQ Schemes in Rayleigh Fading: The Role of Receiver Channel State Information and Its Accuracy","sourcePdf":"tvt-cao-2095471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055853S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5645700","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5645701,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Karedal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Karedal","id":"37294190900"},{"name":"Nicolai Czink","affiliation":["Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Nicolai","lastName":"Czink","id":"37282162900"},{"name":"Alexander Paier","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik und Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Paier","id":"37541081300"},{"name":"Fredrik Tufvesson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Tufvesson","id":"37296876300"},{"name":"Andreas F.

The choice of time-frequency spacing of the symbols in an FTN system for improved bandwidth efficiency is targeted towards efficient hardware implementation. This work proposes a hardware architecture for the realization of iterative decoding of FTN multicarrier modulated signals. Compatibility with existing systems has been considered for smooth switching between the faster-than-Nyquist and orthogonal signaling schemes. One such being the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) for multicarrier modulation. The performance of the fixed point model is very close to that of the floating point representation. The impact of system parameters such as number of projection points, time-frequency spacing, finite wordlengths and their design tradeoffs for reduced complexity iterative decoders in FTN systems have been investigated. The FTN decoder has been designed and synthesized in both 65 nm CMOS and FPGA. From the hardware resource usage numbers it can be concluded that FTN signaling can be used to achieve higher bandwidth efficiency with acceptable complexity overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5739679/05645721.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2089549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2089549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739679","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicarrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Transceivers: Hardware Architecture and Performance Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Modulation","Decoding","Transmitters","Hardware","Interference","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","iterative decoding","modulation","radio transceivers","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier faster-than-Nyquist signaling transceiver","hardware architecture","performance analysis","FTN signaling transceiver","time-frequency spacing","bandwidth efficiency","orthogonal signaling scheme","fast Fourier transform","FFT","multicarrier modulation","CMOS","FPGA","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth efficiency","faster-than-Nyquist","interference cancellation","iterative decoding","multicarrier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multicarrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Transceivers: Hardware Architecture and Performance Analysis","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5645721/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11903661","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicarrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Transceivers: Hardware Architecture and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcsi-dasalukunte-2089549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082541S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5739679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5739679","articleId":"5645721","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5645722,"authors":[{"name":"Wing-Hung Ki","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5756263/5645722/5645722-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wing-Hung Ki (S'86\u2013M'91) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of California, San Diego, in 1984, the M.Sc. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 1985, and the Engineer and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1990 and 1995, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","In 1992, he joined the Department of Power and Battery Management, Micro Linear Corporation, San Jose, CA, as a Senior Design Engineer, working on the design of power converter controllers.

It is shown that the ideal buck converter with a current-sink load can only work in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) but not in continuous conduction mode (CCM), and the same converter with a resistive load can work in CCM, but the output voltage ripple is very large compared to the hysteresis window. Previously published CCM designs are functional because their operations actually rely on the small but nonzero equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the filtering capacitor. For the CCM buck converter with nonzero ESR, our proposed state transition analysis gives a much more accurate switching frequency than previous approaches. The hysteretic voltage mode boost and buck-boost converters are then analyzed, and shown to have no feasible operating region. Crucial simulation results are presented to confirm the analyses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645722/","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5645722/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11972009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Charge Balance Analysis and State Transition Analysis of Hysteretic Voltage Mode Switching Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge Balance Analysis and State Transition Analysis of Hysteretic Voltage Mode Switching Converters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ki-2089557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13028S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5756263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5756263","articleId":"5645722","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5645728,"authors":[{"name":"Craig R.

Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs) built with translinear elements offer a promising solution to this problem. These FPAAs can be built to use previously developed synthesis procedures for translinear circuits. Furthermore, large-scale translinear FPAAs can be built using floating-gate transistors as both the computational elements and the reconfigurable interconnect network. An FPAA built using Multiple Input Translinear Elements (MITEs) has been designed, fabricated in 0.35 \u03bc m CMOS, and tested. These devices have been programmed to implement various circuits including multipliers, squaring circuits, RMS-to-DC converters, and filters. In addition, synthesis, place-and-route, and programming tools have been created in order to implement a reconfigurable system where the circuits implemented are described only by equations. The continued development of translinear FPAAs will lead to a reconfigurable analog system that allows for a large portion of the design to be abstracted away from the user.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MITE-Based Translinear FPAA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2089705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6099858/05645728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2089705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5645728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5645728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A MITE-Based Translinear FPAA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5645728/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12409674","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MITE-Based Translinear FPAA","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-schlottmann-2089705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150199S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6099858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6099858","articleId":"5645728","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5645824,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The values of the approximation coefficients obtained can accurately discriminate between all types of fault in transmission line and reduce the number of data feeding to the ANN. These coefficients are further used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) fitting function. The trained FFNN clearly distinguishes and classify very accurate and very fast the fault type. A typical generation system connected by single circuit transmission line to many nodes of lodes at the receiving end was simulated using MATLAB simulation software using only one node to do this work.

In this paper, the object tracking problem is approached as two independent processes. At each video frame, multi-object information is approximately represented by a set of rectangle patches as the result of object detection and the data set is converted to a set of virtual location measurements as well as the associated feature measurements with assumption that location and feature measurements are independent. In the consequent process, a feature aided integrated probabilistic data association type multi-object tracker is used to recursively update the posterior densities of the objects estimated frame by frame based on the virtual measurements obtained from the former process. The uncertainty of the converted virtual measurements largely depends on the object detection techniques used and it may be handled in the later process by the tracker. Our results demonstrated that the feature aided data association technique can resolve the uncertainty due to the imperfect of virtual measurement process. Furthermore, the required computational overhead is considerably less than those of pixel-wise based approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646048","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646047/05646048.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"118","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient feature aided multi-object tracking in video surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient feature aided multi-object tracking in video surveillance","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5646048/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676134","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646048/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient feature aided multi-object tracking in video surveillance","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061037S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5646047","articleId":"5646048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5646056,"authors":[{"name":"Parag Bhalchandra","affiliation":["School of Computational Science, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded, Maharashtra, India"],"bio":{"p":["P.U.

The motivation of this paper is to introduce the GMM based on the combination between the genetic algorithm (GA) and EM method to give a probabilistic output for further analysis and, more important, to achieve the reliable estimation by pruning the potential outliers and noisy samples in the EEG data, so the performance of BCI system can be improved.

Previous works in field of lipreading mainly have used a level of segmentation at the beginning and then used the structure of the mouth, facial muscles of the speaker, some critical points on the lip, or the motion of these points for word recognition. In this paper we present a novel way of processing the video signal for lipreading application. We neither used segmentation level nor the extraction of important facial points. Instead, we've used HVS (human visual system) based image quality metrics, especially complex wavelet structural similarity (CW-SSIM) and visual information fidelity (VIF) as our similarity criterions. We used an intelligent frame by frame video comparison technique and we applied mentioned metrics in our approach. Experimental results showed that in comparison to other methods, this novel method can recognize the true letter among the letters of the utilized dictionary with an acceptable accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5646210/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676706","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An investigation on the usage of image quality assessment in visual speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation on the usage of image quality assessment in visual speech recognition","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072735S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5646187","articleId":"5646210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5646223,"authors":[{"name":"Fengjian Yang","affiliation":["College of Computational Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fengjian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405692900"},{"name":"Jianfu Yang","affiliation":["College of Computational Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jianfu Yang","id":"37406099500"},{"name":"Dongqing Wu","affiliation":["College of Computational Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongqing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402881500"},{"name":"Chaolong Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computational Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chaolong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533371800"},{"name":"Li-shi Liang","affiliation":["The Haizhu District Chigang Primary School of Guangzhou City, 510310, China"],"lastName":"Li-shi Liang","id":"37591858400"},{"name":"Qun Hong","affiliation":["Haizhu District Chigang Primary School of Guangzhou City, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qun Hong","id":"37591740900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8007-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8004-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8006-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646223","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","content-addressable storage","delays","Hopfield neural nets","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic solution stability","impulsive BAM","Cohen-Grossberg neural network","global exponential stability","impulsive bidirectional associative memories neural networks","Cohen-Grossberg dynamics","variable delays","time-variant coefficient","compressive mapping","Lyapunov functional","Hopfield neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variable delays","Impulse","Global exponential stability","Periodic solution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646223","abstract":"In this paper, the existence and global exponential stability of periodic solution is investigated for a class of impulsive bidirectional associative memories neural networks that possesses a Cohen-Grossberg dynamics incorporating variable delays and time-variant coefficients.

The self-optimizing algorithm is then developed to adjust the structure of CMAC neural network in order to accomplish the minimum modeling error with minimum required memory size, without increase the structure complexness of the network.","doi":"10.1109/KAM.2010.5646268","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639673/5646138/05646268.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"436","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAM.2010.5646268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-optimizing for the Structure of CMAC neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-optimizing for the Structure of CMAC neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11675365","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5646268/","conferenceDate":"20-21 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-optimizing for the Structure of CMAC neural network","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053753S","chronDate":"20-21 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639673","isNumber":"5646138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639673","xplore-issue":"5646138","articleId":"5646268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5646328,"authors":[{"name":"Chan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Chan Jiang","id":"37591408400"},{"name":"Ningmei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Ningmei Yu","id":"37588111700"},{"name":"Meihua Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Meihua Gu","id":"37592839900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8007-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8004-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8006-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646328","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEC","Equations","Bellows","Automatic voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","hardware description languages","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","H.264FRext video coding standard","integer 8 \u00d7 8 discrete cosine transform algorithm","two-dimension DCT hardware structure","fast papilionaceous algorithm","reusable row","column transform unit","Verilog HDL language","SMIC 0.18\u03bcm2 technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264FRext","integer DCT","fast papilionaceous algorithm","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"H.264FRext video coding standard uses integer 8 \u00d7 8 discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm.

Motivated by this, we investigate the asymptotic achievable sum-rate for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access cellular systems in the uplink employing cooperative base stations (BSs) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. In our model, the antennas at the user equipments (UEs), relay terminals, and BSs are correlated and there are direct links between UEs and BSs. Using the replica method, we derive the large-system sum-rate for the uplink system using joint optimal decoding (JOD) as well as separate detection and decoding (SDD) and show that each UE's performance can be characterized by a vector Gaussian channel with an appropriate vector input, an effective channel gain, and a vector Gaussian noise. Based on the asymptotic result, we also devise an efficient algorithm to determine the asymptotic optimum transmit matrices for the UEs and relays that can maximize the sum-rate of the MIMO multiple-access cellular network if the spatial channel covariance information (CCI) is available and exploited at the UEs and the relay terminals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Sum-Rate of Uplink MIMO Cellular Systems with Amplify-and-Forward Relaying and Collaborative Base Stations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.101203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5646333/05646337.pdf","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.101203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Sum-Rate of Uplink MIMO Cellular Systems with Amplify-and-Forward Relaying and Collaborative Base Stations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5646337/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11684786","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Sum-Rate of Uplink MIMO Cellular Systems with Amplify-and-Forward Relaying and Collaborative Base Stations","sourcePdf":"1409jsac0910wen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.210979S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5646333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5646333","articleId":"5646337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5646338,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Each femtocell is served by a home base station (HBS) that is connected to the macrocell base station (BS) via an unreliable network access link, such as DSL followed by the Internet. A scenario with a single macrocell and a single femtocell is considered first, and is then extended to include multiple macrocells and femtocells, both with standard single-cell processing and with multicell processing (or network MIMO). Two main issues are addressed for the uplink channel: (i) Interference management between femto and macrocells; (ii) Robustness to uncertainties on the quality of the femtocell (HBSto-BS) access link. The problem is formulated in information-theoretic terms, and inner and outer bounds are derived to achievable per-cell sum-rates for outdoor and home users. Expected sum-rates with respect to the distribution of the femtocells access link states are studied as well. Overall, the analysis lends evidence to the performance advantages of sophisticated interference management techniques, based on joint decoding and relaying, and of robust coding strategies via the broadcast coding approach (i.e., unequal error protection).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5646333/05646338.pdf","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.101208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.101208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transmission and Interference Management For Femtocells with Unreliable Network Access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Encoding","Interference","Decoding","Macrocell networks","Robustness","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","decoding","interference suppression","microcellular radio","radio links","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular system","femtocells","home base station","macrocell base station","unreliable network access link","multicell processing","interference management","decoding","relaying","broadcast coding approach","robust transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular systems","femtocells","information theory","robust coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transmission and Interference Management For Femtocells with Unreliable Network Access","volume":"28","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5646338/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11684790","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transmission and Interference Management For Femtocells with Unreliable Network Access","sourcePdf":"1469jsac0910simeone.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111593S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5646333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5646333","articleId":"5646338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5646339,"authors":[{"name":"Ritesh Madan","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5646333/5646339/5646339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ritesh Madan received a Ph.D. in 2006 and a M.S. in 2003 from Stanford University, and a B.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in 2001, all in Electrical Engineering.

These new types of base-stations can operate on the same wireless channel as the macro-cellular network, providing higher spatial reuse via cell splitting. However, these base-stations are deployed in an unplanned manner, can have very different transmit powers, and may not have traffic aggregation among many users. This could potentially result in much higher interference magnitude and variability. Hence, such deployments require the use of innovative cell association and inter-cell interference coordination techniques in order to realize the promised capacity and coverage gains. In this paper, we describe new paradigms for design and operation of such heterogeneous cellular networks. Specifically, we focus on cell splitting, range expansion, semi-static resource negotiation on third-party backhaul connections, and fast dynamic interference management for QoS via over-the-air signaling. Notably, our methodologies and algorithms are simple, lightweight, and incur extremely low overhead. Numerical studies show that they provide large gains over currently used methods for cellular networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","volume":"28","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"11684791","publicationDate":"December 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5646339/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cell Association and Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous LTE-A Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell Association and Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous LTE-A Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"1479jsac0910madan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082959S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5646333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"349","xplore-issue":"5646333","articleId":"5646339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5646507,"authors":[{"name":"Dedy Suryadi","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering & Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Dedy","lastName":"Suryadi","id":"37594000600"},{"name":"D.

The method used to find the best grouping is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thus, the algorithm is named SWPSO (Setup & Waiting, PSO). A particle representation is created with dimension length equals to (M + P), i.e. sum of number of machines and recipes to be processed. The position boundaries are between 0 and min{M, P}. For the fitness function in PSO, estimations are used for both setup and waiting time. In particular for waiting time, there is a proportion of non-processing time in the makespan which needs to be found. Through repeated simulation, it is found that the actual makespan is 1.73 times the ideal one. Thus, there is a proportion of non-processing time as much as 0.73. The grouping result is compared with the result from previous research (Cheng, 2008). It is called SGRAM (Setup, Dendogram) because it considers only setup time and uses dendogram to find the best grouping. Comparison is also made with the original grouping, most number of groups, and no grouping. For most performance measures under different lot release policies, SWPSO shows better performance. In the comparison of two dispatching policies for SWPSO grouping, CR shows better performance than FIFO in all but average throughput. Furthermore, in additional cases where the numbers of machine and recipes to be processed are perturbed, SWPSO consistently shows better performance than or at least equal to SGRAM for most performance measures.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEEM.2010.5646507","startPage":"773","endPage":"778","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 17Th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5634838/5645891/05646507.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 17Th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEEM.2010.5646507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine-process grouping algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group theory","machinery","machining","particle swarm optimisation","production equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine-process grouping algorithm","particle swarm optimization","waiting time","setup time","particle representation","dendogram","dispatching policy","performance measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","machine-process grouping","changeover time","waiting time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Machine-process grouping algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5646507/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11684599","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine-process grouping algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"1672110123d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077828S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5634838","isNumber":"5645891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5634838","xplore-issue":"5645891","articleId":"5646507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5646582,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Sun","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, Engineering Research Center of MES Technology for Iron and Steel Production, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37589860500"},{"name":"Tie-ke Li","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, Engineering Research Center of MES Technology for Iron and Steel Production, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tie-ke","lastName":"Li","id":"37539275200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6484-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6483-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6482-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646582","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646582","abstract":"A financial index forecasting model based on modified RBF neural network is proposed to find important points of stock index which can solve market identification problem.

All kinds of steady state and transient fault features are extracted from zero sequence current signals through the wavelet transform and Fourier transform. These fault features are regarded as the condition attributes of an information system and fault states as the decision attribute of the information system, then the information system is constructed. By use of attribute reduction and value reduction based on rough set theory, the information system is reduced. The reduced fault features are regarded as inputs a neural network and the reduced samples as the training samples of the neural network. Then the training samples are normalized using rough set theory and the normalized samples are used to train neural network. The trained neural network model can realize fault line detection. The simulation and field verification results show that the method reaches higher training speed and lower error rate.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646686","startPage":"3784","endPage":"3788","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646144","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646144/05646686.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved neural network based on rough set and application in fault line detection for distribution network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646686/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved neural network based on rough set and application in fault line detection for distribution network","isConference":true,"volume":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5646686/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11676273","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved neural network based on rough set and application in fault line detection for distribution network","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067049S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","xplore-issue":"5646144","articleId":"5646686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5646690,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599839600"},{"name":"Zhiyan Han","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyan","lastName":"Han","id":"37597243800"},{"name":"Shuxian Lun","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Shuxian","lastName":"Lun","id":"37269732500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646690","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646690","abstract":"In view of the stronger superiority of deaf-mute in visual identification ability and visual memory ability for color, a new speech visualization method for speech signals with very good classification and location ability was proposed. It created readable patterns by integrating different speech features into a single picture. Firstly, series preprocessing of speech signals were done. Secondly, extracting features were done, among them, using three formant features mapped principal color information, using intonation features mapped pattern information via neural network 1, and then all features used as the inputs of neural network 2. Finally, the outputs of neural network mapped the position information. We evaluated the visualized speech in a preliminary test and contrasted with spectrogram, the test result shows that the visualization approach is very effective for assisting deaf-mute learning and has very good robustness.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646690","startPage":"3528","endPage":"3532","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646157/05646690.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech visualization research based on combined feature and neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Visualization","Artificial neural networks","Auditory system","Feature extraction","Spectrogram","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","feature extraction","handicapped aids","neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech visualization research","neural network","deaf-mute learning","visual identification ability","visual memory ability","readable patterns","speech signal preprocessing series","feature extraction","formant features mapped principal color information","intonation features mapped pattern information","spectrogram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech signal","combined feature","neural network","speech visualization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Speech visualization research based on combined feature and neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5646690/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676380","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech visualization research based on combined feature and neural network","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047429S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","xplore-issue":"5646157","articleId":"5646690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5646698,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["VLSI and System Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38553967300"},{"name":"Hongyan Yang","affiliation":["VLSI and System Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37596712700"},{"name":"Wuchen Wu","affiliation":["VLSI and System Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wuchen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292827600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646698","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":765},"abstract":"With the advance of semiconductor technology and the development of multimedia techniques, CMOS image sensor is extensively applied in medical and other industrial areas.

However, the resampling detection is always severely affected by the blocking artifacts introduced by JPEG compression. In order to solve this problem, in this paper an effective method has been proposed to distinguish the periodicity introduced by resampling and JPEG compression. At first, the probability map of an image was obtained by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Then, it was Fourier-transformed and matched with affine-transform templates and a scaled JPEG template to detect whether the image was resampled, JPEG-compressed or both of them. Experimental results are provided to show the given method is dependable and effective in different kinds of digital tampering when resampling and JPEG compression occurred. Moreover, compared to the existed methods, better results are obtained by us.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Image coding","Pixel","Forgery","Correlation","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","data compression","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Fourier transforms","image coding","image sampling","interpolation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resampling forgery detection","JPEG-compressed images","digital forgery","digital images","scaling operation","interpolation","blocking artifacts","probability map","expectation-maximization","Fourier transform","affine transform templates","digital tampering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital forgery","JPEG Compression","Resampling","Expectation-Maximization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646732","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5645820/05646732.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resampling forgery detection in JPEG-compressed images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resampling forgery detection in JPEG-compressed images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646732/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5646732/","accessionNumber":"11676035","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resampling forgery detection in JPEG-compressed images","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055514S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5645820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5645820","articleId":"5646732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5646737,"authors":[{"name":"Shenghua Zhou","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shenghua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37595333000"},{"name":"Kuiying Yin","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Kuiying","lastName":"Yin","id":"37605005200"},{"name":"Tao Luo","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37596571300"},{"name":"Hongwei Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292094700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646737","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Design automation","MIMO radar","Receivers","Detection algorithms","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO radar","radar detection","radar target recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target detection","spatial diversity MIMO radar","space partition","target echo signals","surveillance volume","incoherent accumulating detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar target detection","MIMO radar","spatial diversity radar","space partition based detection"]}],"abstract":"For spatial diversity multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar, target echo signals received by its widely separated antennas may be semi-correlated and different in SNR.

It is proved that the bit error ratio of the system is decreased and the performance of the system is improved using the algorithm of SVD.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646174/05646768.pdf","startPage":"4467","endPage":"4471","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The research and realization of SVD algorithm in OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Decoding","Encoding","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","error statistics","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SVD algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","rectangular multicarrier modulation","intersymbol interference","interchannel interference","channel estimation","singular value decomposition","OFDM system module","MATLAB Simulink platform","bit error ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","channel estimation","SVD","Simulink"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The research and realization of SVD algorithm in OFDM system","isConference":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5646768/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676501","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The research and realization of SVD algorithm in OFDM system","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081397S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5646174","articleId":"5646768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5646770,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuyan Zhang","affiliation":["Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598085000"},{"name":"Yubo Duan","affiliation":["Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China"],"firstName":"Yubo","lastName":"Duan","id":"37603617300"},{"name":"Guobin Tao","affiliation":["Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China"],"firstName":"Guobin","lastName":"Tao","id":"37892830200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646770","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"abstract":"One of the main drawbacks of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signal. In this paper, a optimum combination method based on partial transmit sequences is presented for MIMO-OFDM Peak-to-Average Power Ratio reduction. Firstly, PAPR is reduced by optimization of weighting coefficients. Then PAPR is reduced by selection of optimized data segmentation method. Simulation results have shown that optimum combination of partial transmit sequences (PTS) can obviously improve PAPR performance in the MIMO-OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646174/05646770.pdf","startPage":"4476","endPage":"4479","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The research of peak\u2013to\u2013average power ratio performance by optimum combination of partial transmit sequences in MIMO-OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Optimization","Iterative methods","Partial transmit sequences","MIMO","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio performance reduction","partial transmit sequences","MIMO-OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","PAPR","weighting coefficient optimisation","optimized data segmentation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","Data segmentation","Optimization of weighting coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The research of peak\u2013to\u2013average power ratio performance by optimum combination of partial transmit sequences in MIMO-OFDM system","isConference":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5646770/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676503","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The research of peak\u2013to\u2013average power ratio performance by optimum combination of partial transmit sequences in MIMO-OFDM system","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038529S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5646174","articleId":"5646770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5646772,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533622400"},{"name":"Ruizhe Yang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruizhe","lastName":"Yang","id":"37536115500"},{"name":"Yanhua Sun","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanhua","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291601200"},{"name":"Yanhua Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292458700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646772","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"abstract":"This paper considers two hop MIMO-OFDM AF relaying systems with separate power constraint at source and relay.

Experiments show that satisfactory colorization results can be obtained, and computation cost is reduced as compared to previous methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5646848/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image colorization with edge detection and sub-sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image colorization with edge detection and sub-sampling","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038031S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5645820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5645820","articleId":"5646848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5646888,"authors":[{"name":"Jasper Jahn","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Germany"],"firstName":"Jasper","lastName":"Jahn","id":"37587489800"},{"name":"Ulrich Batzer","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Batzer","id":"38269956400"},{"name":"Jochen Seitz","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Seitz","id":"38495274900"},{"name":"Lucila Patino-Studencka","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Germany"],"firstName":"Lucila","lastName":"Patino-Studencka","id":"38276157200"},{"name":"Javier Guti\u00e9rrez Boronat","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Germany"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Guti\u00e9rrez Boronat","id":"37087702096"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5865-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5862-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646888","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accelerometers","Calibration","Sensors","Systematics","Acceleration","Legged locomotion","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","inertial navigation","length measurement","mobile handsets","mobile radio","notebook computers","sensor placement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration","step length estimators","handheld devices","pedestrian dead reckoning","sensor placement","mobile measurement","smartphone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerometer","Pedestrian Dead Reckoning","Pedestrian Navigation","Step Length Estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5646888","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2010.5646888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2010.5646888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645818","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637226/5645818/05646888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison and evaluation of acceleration based step length estimators for handheld devices","abstract":"A comparison between different step length estimation algorithms for pedestrian dead reckoning is presented.

Experimental results show that the fuzzy neural network approach is effective to merge images from different sensors.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646957","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1551","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646679/05646957.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5646957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisensor image fusion based on a fuzzy neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Pixel","Image edge detection","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","image fusion","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor image fusion","fuzzy neural network","visualization","surveillance","Sugeno-type fuzzy if-then rules","membership functions","image fusion performance measures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image fusion","fuzzy logic","neural network","fuzzy inference system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5646957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor image fusion based on a fuzzy neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5646957/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676814","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensor image fusion based on a fuzzy neural network","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120219S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","xplore-issue":"5646679","articleId":"5646957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5646958,"authors":[{"name":"Jionghua Teng","affiliation":["College of automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jionghua","lastName":"Teng","id":"37534986400"},{"name":"Suhuan Wang","affiliation":["College of automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Suhuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538891600"},{"name":"Jingzhou Zhang","affiliation":["College of automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jingzhou","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37540277200"},{"name":"Xue Wang","affiliation":["College of automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540114200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5646958","dbTime":"57 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Entropy","Artificial neural networks","Fuses","Medical diagnostic imaging","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuro-fuzzy logic based fusion algorithm","medical images","single photon emission computed tomography","nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","hybrid algorithm","least mean square algorithm","standard deviation","information entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["medical image fusion","Fuzzy logic","neuro-fuzzy inference","neural network"]}],"abstract":"CT, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are complementary on reflecting human information.

Employ the data of medical image CT, SPECT and MRI to achieve the fusion simulation, and compare with the simulation results of BP neural network on the basis of the evaluation standards which are the standard deviation and the information entropy.

The key point of non-uniform partition approximation is that the gray values of the pixels are regarded as fitting data, which is fitted with the least squares method, and then the digital image is expressed as a piecewise polynomial. The nonuniform partition approximation can realize image denoising by expressing the contaminated image as a piecewise polynomial. Since non-uniform partition can retain the edges as well as detailed characteristics, and wavelet transform can well retain field texture in image denoising, this paper combines these two methods to process image denoising. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient to improve the quality of denoised images and PSNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image denoising method based on non-uniform partition and wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647188","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646712/05647188.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Image denoising method based on non-uniform partition and wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5647188/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676888","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image denoising method based on non-uniform partition and wavelet transform","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058452S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5646712","articleId":"5647188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647211,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhen Yue","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yizhen","lastName":"Yue","id":"37593643000"},{"name":"Caiming Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Caiming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533371200"},{"name":"Fuhua Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Fuhua","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38609971900"},{"name":"Xuemei Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Li","id":"37600370800"},{"name":"Kunpeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Kunpeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066903100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647211","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647211","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Pixel","Image edge detection","Visualization","PSNR","Convolution","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image sampling","interpolation","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image interpolation","point sampling","edge directed method","image data","fitting surfaces","bi-quadratic polynomial surface patch","image surface","weighting functions","objective visual quality"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new algorithm for image interpolation via combining bi-quadratic patches based on point sampling and new edge-directed method (PSE).

The whole image surface is constructed by combining all the local patches with weighting functions.

Before the super-resolution, classify method is used to mark the high-frequency patches of the low-resolution image with corresponding labels. During superresolution, the distances between each matching patches of low-resolution image and middle-frequency patches of training set are computed. The candidate patch is the patch within training set with the minimum distance. For the patches labeled with non-edge, few candidates are selected, while for flat patches the matching step can be canceled, directly replacing high-resolution patches by enlarged interpolation of low-resolution patches. Two examples are use to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, one using a factitious image obtained by blurring and down-sampling an original image, and another using directly a true image.

One-line diagrams are used in electric power system visualization which is very important in modern control centers for both online and offline operations as the graphical representations convey information to dispatchers and engineers allowing them to quickly isolate faults, optimize operation, find week spots, etc. The input of the automatic one-line diagram generation algorithm shown in this paper is an electric power system's representation in the IEC's standard Common Information Model (CIM) format. A mathematical graph is created from the model, by creating a vertex for each substation and an edge for each power line. As power distribution systems can be very large, containing even hundreds of thousands of substations, it can be argued that the graph has to be broken down into smaller components which are then visualized separately and then assembled by use of the genetic algorithm. The results shown in this paper are applicable to radial electric power distribution systems. This paper presents initial results and diagrams generated with the proposed algorithm for simplified power systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647311/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11675236","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647311/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"10-11 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electric power system one-line diagram generation with genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric power system one-line diagram generation with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Subotica, Serbia","sourcePdf":"91sisy2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121335S","chronDate":"10-11 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5598965","isNumber":"5647054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598965","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5647054","articleId":"5647311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5647319,"authors":[{"name":"Er.

Secondly, it is used to warn about natural disasters. Due to non-linearity in climatic physics, neural networks are suitable to predict these meteorological processes. Back Propagation algorithm using gradient descent method is the most important algorithm to train a neural network for weather forecasting. Back propagation algorithm suffers from several problems. In this paper, in order to overcome some of these problems, an integrated back propagation based genetic algorithm technique to train artificial neural networks is proposed. In the proposed technique, back propagation is combined with genetic algorithm in such a way that the pitfalls of the algorithm get converted to benefits.

METANET model is one of the most applicable models in traffic modeling in which the parameters have plenty of effects on the model behavior. In this paper, the effects of the model parameters on the model behavior and the estimation quality of the system states in the undetermined parameters are described. The extended Kalman filtering (EKF) algorithm instead of the error back-propagation (BP) algorithm is used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) for dynamical traffic networks modeling. The basic idea is to prevent over fitting discrepancy occurrence caused by outliers in the training samples by the EKF. Numerical simulations show that the EKF algorithm is greater to the BP algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SISY.2010.5647390","pdfPath":"/iel5/5598965/5647054/05647390.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 8th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE 8th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISY.2010.5647390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic state variables estimating and predicting with neural network via extended Kalman filter algorithm with estimated parameters as offline","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Traffic state variables estimating and predicting with neural network via extended Kalman filter algorithm with estimated parameters as offline","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11675261","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5647390/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic state variables estimating and predicting with neural network via extended Kalman filter algorithm with estimated parameters as offline","confLoc":"Subotica, Serbia","sourcePdf":"71sisy2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06965S","chronDate":"10-11 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5598965","isNumber":"5647054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598965","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5647054","articleId":"5647390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647447,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchao Mu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Mu","id":"37604853400"},{"name":"Donglin Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Donglin","lastName":"Su","id":"37291711300"},{"name":"Meiguo Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meiguo","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289044300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647447","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647447","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Covariance matrix","Signal to noise ratio","Training","Adaptive arrays","Sensor arrays","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Gaussian processes","geometry","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","eigen-space based adaptive beamformer","probability density function","normalized conditioned signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","narrow-band antenna arrays","arbitrary geometry","covariance matrix","Gaussian signal model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["eigen-space based beamformer","performance analysis","perturbation expansion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647447","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646144/05647447.pdf","startPage":"3955","endPage":"3958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of eigen-space based adaptive beamformer","abstract":"An approach resulting in an approximate expression for the probability density function (pdf) of the normalized conditioned signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (NCSINR) for eigen-space based adaptive beamformer for narrow-band antenna arrays of arbitrary geometry is proposed in this paper.

The singular value vector and 2D discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) coefficients of no-overlapping sub-images are fused in feature level by the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to construct an efficient set of observation vectors. Experiments to evaluate the proposed approach are carried out on the Georgia Tech (GT) face databases and the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) databases.

However, for ISDB-S2 (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting via Satellite - Second Generation) LDPC decoder, applying layered algorithm directly will result in data conflict problem. In this paper, a novel selective recalculation method is proposed to solve the data conflict problem. It determines the inaccurately calculated values based on a recalculation decision rule, and correct them accordingly. By applying this selective recalculation method, the layered algorithm can achieve conflict free BER performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve 0.1dB gain for the code with most conflicts in ISDB-S2, under the same BER performance compared to the previous strategy to solve data conflict problem.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647529","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646164/05647529.pdf","startPage":"2985","endPage":"2989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data conflict resolution for layered LDPC decoding algorithm by selective recalculation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Data conflict resolution for layered LDPC decoding algorithm by selective recalculation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647529/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11676487","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647529/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data conflict resolution for layered LDPC decoding algorithm by selective recalculation","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066584S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5646164","articleId":"5647529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647555,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Typical modern GPUs use wide SIMD processing, and have achieved impressive performance for a variety of graphics processing including ray tracing. However, SIMD efficiency can be reduced due to the divergent branching and memory access patterns that are common in ray tracing codes. This paper explores an alternative approach using MIMD processing cores custom-designed for ray tracing. By relaxing the requirement that instruction paths be synchronized as in SIMD, caches and less frequently used area expensive functional units may be more effectively shared. Heavy resource sharing provides significant area savings while still maintaining a high MIMD issue rate from our numerous light-weight cores. This paper explores the design space of this architecture and compares performance to the best reported results for a GPU ray tracer and a parallel ray tracer using general purpose cores. We show an overall performance that is six to ten times higher in a similar die area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient MIMD architectures for high-performance ray tracing","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647555","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647555.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient MIMD architectures for high-performance ray tracing","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647555/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675631","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient MIMD architectures for high-performance ray tracing","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"009Kopta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096719S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647557,"authors":[{"name":"Lanjun Qian","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lanjun","lastName":"Qian","id":"37588682800"},{"name":"Canyan Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Canyan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085805051"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647557","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":665},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Frequency modulation","Artificial neural networks","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cognitive radio","modulation","neural nets","pattern recognition","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation classification","cyclic spectral features","cognitive radio","modulation type","modulated signals","spectral correlation function","backpropagation neural network","pattern recognition","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modulation classification","cyclic spectral function","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647557","abstract":"There is a need, for example in cognitive radio (CR), to determine the modulation type of an incoming signal. In this paper, an approach to classify modulated signals has been proposed. Firstly, extracting features from the spectral correlation function. Values of these features locate in different ranges, so they are suitable for classification. Since the spectral correlation function (SCF) is insensitive to noise, features obtained from it have good classifying performance even in low SNR. Subsequently the BP (Back Propagation) neural network was designed for pattern recognition. By combining the features extracted from spectral correlation function and using neural network for recognition, the classifier achieved excellent results for the AM, DSB, FM, 2FSK, 4FSK, BPSK, QPSK schemes.

Only in this way can algorithms such as MUSIC, Capon's beamformer estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the sources unambiguously. However, in some practical use, it seems difficult to satisfy the spatial sampling theorem. Compressed Sensing (CS) is a novel theory which enables perfect recovery of signals and data from what appear highly sub-Nyquist-rate samples on the condition that the signals or data are sparse or compressible in some domain. This implies that for spatially sparse signals, we can design a linear array with sparse property that will enable us to implement DOA estimates or even reconstruct the original signals accurately. In this paper, we proposed a parameters estimation method based on arrays with sub-Nyquist spatio-temporal sampling. We first sample the signals randomly in spatial domain, which means extracting a finite number of elements from a conventional uniform linear array. Then the signal in each channel is sampled by a random demodulator. By performing CS reconstruction algorithms, not only the DOAs can be estimated, but the original sources' waveforms will be recovered accurately.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647562","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646144/05647562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646144","startPage":"3950","endPage":"3954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameters estimation using a random linear array and compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameters estimation using a random linear array and compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647562/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676193","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5647562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameters estimation using a random linear array and compressed sensing","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071431S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5646144","articleId":"5647562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647568,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Qu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dongdong","lastName":"Qu","id":"37418010500"},{"name":"Baoshan Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Baoshan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37533369000"},{"name":"Jian Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37596871600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647568","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal reconstruction","Reliability","Strontium","Nonuniform sampling","Baseband","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pointwise assessment","finite set","arbitrarily distributed samples","spectrum support function","signal reconstruction reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["aliasing","nonuniform sampling","quality of signal reconstruction","signal reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647568","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646144","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646144/05647568.pdf","startPage":"3610","endPage":"3614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pointwise assessment of quality of signal reconstruction from a finite set of arbitrarily distributed samples","abstract":"A method of assessing the quality of signal reconstruction is presented.

Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of this technology and pointed out that accurate reliability analyses should be accomplished to assure proper yield requirements. Due to the complexity of these systems and the arising necessity of thorough fault analysis, design automation tools are mandatory in order to explore architectural solutions and fault tolerant approaches deriving information from reliable nanoarray characterisation. We present a simulator, never attempted at this level of detail, based on specific technological and topological tiled nanoarray descriptions, conceived to carry on characterisations in terms of logic behaviour, defect-induced error rate assessment, switching activity and other figures of merit like power and timing performance (not discussed in this paper). It is formulated in a flexible and modular way to assure the simulation of manifold advancing technological solutions, among which the winner has not been determined yet. Marking a difference with respect to the state of the art, the algorithm is based on an event-driven engine and not on cost functions evaluations. Thus even dynamic control sequences can be processed and their evolution followed throughout all the inner components of the array allowing to obtain system level characterization as a projection of the real internal parameters. In this paper we show results attained for one of the possible nanoarray structures proposed in literature, the NASIC: logic behaviour, defect error rates and switching activity for two types of function demonstrate the simulator trustworthiness, its effectiveness for extensive nanoarrays characterisation and its suitability as a foundation for both higher architectural and lower device simulation levels.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647586.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible simulation methodology and tool for nanoarray-based architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A flexible simulation methodology and tool for nanoarray-based architectures","htmlLink":"/document/5647586/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11675620","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible simulation methodology and tool for nanoarray-based architectures","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"060Frache.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076056S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647596,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Dei\u00dfler","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcmberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Dei\u00dfler","id":"37547496900"},{"name":"J\u00f6rn Thielecke","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcmberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rn","lastName":"Thielecke","id":"37388458100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5865-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5862-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647596","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":882},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Particle filters","Ultra wideband radar","Navigation","Kalman filters","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Monte Carlo methods","navigation","receiving antennas","sensor fusion","SLAM (robots)","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB SLAM","Rao-Blackwellized Monte Carlo data association","ultra wideband radar","simultaneous localization and mapping","receiver antenna","transmitter antenna","time of flight measurement","bat type antenna array","navigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","SLAM","indoor navigation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB SLAM with Rao-Blackwellized Monte Carlo data association","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2010.5647596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645818","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637226/5645818/05647596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2010.5647596","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647596","abstract":"In situations where the environment is filled with dust or smoke, like in many emergency scenarios, it is still possible to sense the surrounding and build maps by using ultra-wideband (UWB) Radar. This can help firemen and other rescue personnel. In this paper, a method to solve the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem is presented. Using UWB radar with a bat-type antenna array consisting of two RX antennas and one TX antenna in the middle, features of the surroundings are detected and used as landmarks for navigation. The main challenge of this approach is the problem of data association, i.e. the task of assigning time-of-flight measurements to corresponding landmarks. The solution presented in this article uses a state space model in combination with a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11677819","htmlLink":"/document/5647596/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"UWB SLAM with Rao-Blackwellized Monte Carlo data association","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB SLAM with Rao-Blackwellized Monte Carlo data association","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"Track09Deissler9871747final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042606S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637226","isNumber":"5645818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637226","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5645818","articleId":"5647596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5647605,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Ting Zhou","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Shi-Ting","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38255153000"},{"name":"Sumeet Katariya","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Sumeet","lastName":"Katariya","id":"38258482600"},{"name":"Hamid Ghasemi","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Ghasemi","id":"37824031500"},{"name":"Stark Draper","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Stark","lastName":"Draper","id":"37265283000"},{"name":"Nam Sung Kim","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Nam Sung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404885800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8937-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8936-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8935-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5647605","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1081},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647605","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Redundancy","Arrays","Error correction codes","Microprocessors","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","error correction codes","low-power electronics","power aware computing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM arrays","joint optimization","ECC","power consumption","processor","first-order priority","voltage scaling","power-reduction technique","large-scale memory structure","last-level caches","error-correction coding strength"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647605","endPage":"117","startPage":"112","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647605.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing total area of low-voltage SRAM arrays through joint optimization of cell size, redundancy, and ECC","abstract":"The increasing power consumption of processors has made power reduction a first-order priority in their design. Voltage scaling is one of the most successful power-reduction techniques introduced to date, but it is limited to some minimum voltage, VDDMIN, below which all components cannot operate reliably. In particular, ever-increasing process variability due to shrinking feature size further degrades the low-voltage reliability of, e.g., SRAM cells. Larger SRAM cells are less sensitive to process variability and their use would allow a reduction in VDDMIN. However, large-scale memory structures, e.g., last-level caches (LLCs) that often determine the VDDMIN of processors, cannot afford to use such large SRAM cells due to the resulting increase in die area. In this paper we propose a joint optimization of LLC cell size, number of redundant cells, and ECC (error-correction coding) strength to minimize total SRAM area while meeting target yields and VDDMIN. The use of redundant cells and ECC enable the use of smaller cell sizes while maintaining target yields and VDDMIN. Smaller cell sizes more than make up for the extra cells required by redundancy and ECC. We first assess each approach individually, i.e., only redundancy or ECC for various cell sizes. We then consider a combined approach and observe significant improvements. For example, in 32nm technology our combined approach yields a 27% reduction in total SRAM area (including redundant cells) when targeting a VDDMIN of 600mV.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and

The traditional optical test facility has disadvantages of fixed structure and low test precision and efficiency. Another kind of test facility is based on pure electrical instruments, and the modern industrial controlled computer and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) based electrical signal source is the key component part, but this kind of electrical signal is bulky and costly. This paper presents a novel hardware design approach for electrical signal source. The adoption of Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) and FPGA greatly increases flexibility of the system and decreases power consumption and cost. Tasks taken by ARM and FPGA are also properly divided. ARM is mainly used for earth wave algorithm and human-computer interaction. FPGA is mainly used for interface timing conversion. The use of FPGA releases ARM from tedious tasks and simplifies design of the peripheral circuits of ARM. The function modules implemented in ARM and FPGA are introduced in detail. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the new hardware design approach for electrical signal source is valid.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647626","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646164/05647626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646164","startPage":"2742","endPage":"2746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARM and FPGA based electrical signal source for swing scanning infrared earth sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ARM and FPGA based electrical signal source for swing scanning infrared earth sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647626/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676410","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5647626/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARM and FPGA based electrical signal source for swing scanning infrared earth sensor","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062495S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","xplore-issue":"5646164","articleId":"5647626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647650,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Huang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37593438000"},{"name":"Tze-Yun Sung","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tze-Yun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37267969200"},{"name":"Yaw-Shih Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yaw-Shih","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37602303800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647650","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Program processors","Signal processing algorithms","Complexity theory","Arrays","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete cosine transforms","matrix algebra","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI linear array","one-dimensional N-point discrete cosine transform","inverse discrete cosine transform architecture","subband decomposition algorithm","row-column decomposition technique","two-dimensional architecture","1D DCT-IDCT processors","DCT-IDCT transformation matrices","computation complexity","hardware complexity","variable-length 2D DCT-IDCT computation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D DCT/IDCT","sub-band decomposition algorithm","linear array","orthonormal matrix","VLSI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647650","abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient one-dimensional (1-D) N-point discrete cosine and inverse discrete cosine transform (DCT/IDCT) architectures using sub-band decomposition algorithm.

The proposed architectures with computation complexity O(5N/8) and O(3N/8) for DCT and IDCT, respectively, and low hardware complexity O(3N/8) for both DCT and IDCT are fully pipelined and scalable for variable-length 2-D DCT/IDCT computation.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647650","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646144/05647650.pdf","startPage":"3686","endPage":"3690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel VLSI linear array for 2-D DCT/IDCT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel VLSI linear array for 2-D DCT/IDCT","isConference":true,"volume":"8","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11676205","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647650/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel VLSI linear array for 2-D DCT/IDCT","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078348S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5646144","articleId":"5647650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5647656,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600149500"},{"name":"Lu Si","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Si","id":"37603809400"},{"name":"Zhanxin Yang","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhanxin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406201100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647656","dbTime":"142 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"abstract":"In OFDM systems, the Wiener filter could be an important key for channel estimation.

However, in most cases, the channel is composed of a few dominant taps and a large part of taps is approximately zero or zero. They are often called sparse multi-path channels (MPC). Conventional linear MPC methods, such as the least squares (LS), do not exploit the sparsity of MPC. In general, accurate sparse MPC estimator can be obtained by solving a LASSO problem even in the presence of noise. In this paper, a novel CS-based sparse MPC method by using Dantzig selector (DS) is introduced. This method exploits a channel's sparsity to reduce the number of training sequence and, hence, increase spectral efficiency when compared to existed methods with computer simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646174","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646174/05647668.pdf","endPage":"4453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse multipath channel estimation using ds algorithm in wideband communication systems","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647668","startPage":"4450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Sparse multipath channel estimation using ds algorithm in wideband communication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647668/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11676514","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5647668/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse multipath channel estimation using ds algorithm in wideband communication systems","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049785S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5646174","articleId":"5647668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647669,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Loew","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of New York, Binghamton"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Loew","id":"37545400600"},{"name":"Jesse Elwell","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of New York, Binghamton"],"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Elwell","id":"37587235500"},{"name":"Dmitry Ponomarev","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of New York, Binghamton"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Ponomarev","id":"37274792800"},{"name":"Patrick H.

In this paper we propose efficient algorithms for linear image processing by exploring the provided SIMD extensions on AMD and Intel processors. The efficiency of the SIMD based computation inferred by the OpenCL compiler is also experimentally evaluated. Starting from a reference algorithm and implementation, several optimizations are proposed that lead to increasingly higher performance figures. Experimental results suggest an average 4-fold performance improvement when the vectorization of the operations is tuned. Furthermore, more than 10 times speedup is suggested by applying efficient data organization. The experimental work and achieved results also suggest that the SIMD based OpenCL implementations provide an average of 1.8 times lower performance than equivalent implementations that directly employ the SIMD intrinsics supported by the Intel Compiler.

Deriving power maps from measured thermal maps is the inverse problem of the power-to-temperature mapping, extensively studied through thermal simulation. Until recently this inverse heat conduction problem has received little attention in the microarchitecture research community. This paper first identifies the source of difficulties for the problem. The inverse mapping is then performed by applying constraints from microarchitecture-level observations. The inherent large sensitivity of the resultant power map is minimized through thermal map-filtering and constrained least-squares optimization. Choices of filter parameters and optimization constraints are investigated and their effects are evaluated. Furthermore, the paper highlights the differences between the grid and block modeling in the inverse mapping which were often ignored by previous schemes. The proposed methods reduce the mapping error by more than 10\u00d7 compared to unoptimized solutions. To our best knowledge this is the first work to quantitatively evaluate and minimize the noise effect in the temperature to power mapping problem at the microarchitecture level for both grid and block mode, and for the steady and transient case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647690.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"389","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-to-power mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Thermal noise","Thermal sensors","Steady-state","Optimization","Temperature measurement","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","heat conduction","integrated circuit modelling","least squares approximations","low-power electronics","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature-to-power mapping","power model validation","process variation characterization","leakage estimation","power optimization","inverse heat conduction problem","constrained least squares optimization","thermal map filtering","grid modeling","block modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-to-power mapping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647690/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675664","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-to-power mapping","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"384Qi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086907S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647702,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Zea","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA","Electrical & Computer Eng.

A typical implementation of timing speculation involves speculatively reducing the voltage of a processor to a point where errors are possible but rare, and employing an error recovery mechanism to ensure correct functionality. This allows significant energy savings with a small recovery overhead. Previous work on timing speculation has either explored the benefits of customizing the design methodology for a particular error resilience mechanism or has attempted to understand the benefits from error resilience for a particular processor design. There is no work, to the best of our knowledge, that attempts to understand the benefits of co-optimizing microarchitecture and error resilience. In this paper, we present the first study on co-optimizing a processor pipeline and an error resilience mechanism. We develop an analytical model that relates the benefits from error resiliency to the depth of the pipeline as well as its circuit structure. The model is then used to determine the optimal pipeline depth for different energy efficiency metrics for different error resilience overheads. Our results demonstrate that several interesting relationships exist between error resilience and pipeline structure. For example, we show that there are significant energy efficiency benefits to pipelining an architecture for an error resiliency mechanism vs error resiliency-agnostic pipelining. As another example, we show that benefits from error resiliency are greater for short pipelines than long pipelines. We also confirm that the benefits from error resiliency are higher when the circuit structure is such that error rate increases slowly on reducing input voltage vs a circuit optimized for power where a slack wall exists at the nominal operating point. Finally, we quantify the difference in benefits from error resiliency for irregular vs regular workloads and show that benefits from error resiliency are higher for irregular workloads. Our analytical results were validated using a cycle-accurate simulation-based model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power/performance pipelining for error resilient processors","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647702","startPage":"356","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647702.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power/performance pipelining for error resilient processors","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647702/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675668","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power/performance pipelining for error resilient processors","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"356Zea.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087974S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647724,"authors":[{"name":"Joonsoo Kim","affiliation":["University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Joonsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600784300"},{"name":"Joonsoo Lee","affiliation":["University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Joonsoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065083700"},{"name":"Jacob A.

We focus on a method to predict the system throughput when processing an arbitrarily long data frame given the meta-characteristics of the workload in that frame. This is useful for different purposes, such as resource allocation or dynamic voltage scaling in embedded systems. An accurate enough analysis is not trivial when two factors are combined: parallelism and dynamic workload variations. In earlier work, two analysis methods showed good accuracy for several application examples, but no comparative experiments were carried out. In this work, we contribute new propositions to the theoretical basis of the previous methods. Based on these propositions, we remove a potential problem in a common subroutine and propose a new analysis method.We compare the methods experimentally. The new method provides a significant reduction of the throughput prediction error, up to 12%.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647740","startPage":"282","endPage":"288","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647740.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting the throughput of multiprocessor applications under dynamic workload","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Throughput","Delay","Steady-state","Transient analysis","Accuracy","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput calculation","real-time multiprocessor application","system throughput","dynamic workload variation","throughput prediction error","multiprocessor parallelism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Predicting the throughput of multiprocessor applications under dynamic workload","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675678","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting the throughput of multiprocessor applications under dynamic workload","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"282Poplavko.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058503S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647753,"authors":[{"name":"Vaibhav Gupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37589866800"},{"name":"Georgios Karakonstantis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Karakonstantis","id":"37545574600"},{"name":"Debabrata Mohapatra","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Debabrata","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37540326200"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8937-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8936-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8935-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5647753","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a unified approach to an energy-efficient variation-tolerant design of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in the context of image processing applications. It is to be noted that it is not necessary to produce exactly correct numerical outputs in most image processing applications. We exploit this important feature and propose a design methodology for DWT which shows energy quality tradeoffs at each level of design hierarchy starting from the algorithm level down to the architecture and circuit levels by taking advantage of the limited perceptual ability of the Human Visual System. A unique feature of this design methodology is that it guarantees robustness under process variability and facilitates aggressive voltage over-scaling. Simulation results show significant energy savings (74%-83%) with minor degradations in output image quality and avert catastrophic failures under process variations compared to a conventional design.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640356/5647518/05647753.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VEDA: Variation-aware energy-efficient Discrete Wavelet Transform architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","PSNR","Image quality","Image reconstruction","Computer architecture","Adders","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient variation-tolerant design","discrete wavelet transform architecture","image processing application","energy quality tradeoffs","human visual system","voltage over-scaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"VEDA: Variation-aware energy-efficient Discrete Wavelet Transform architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647753/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675681","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VEDA: Variation-aware energy-efficient Discrete Wavelet Transform architecture","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"260Gupta.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043911S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5647756,"authors":[{"name":"Shohreh Sharif Mansouri","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Shohreh","lastName":"Sharif Mansouri","id":"37296924100"},{"name":"Elena Dubrova","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Dubrova","id":"37269340000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8937-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8936-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8935-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"5647756","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Latches","Clocks","Delay","Pulse generation","Transistors","Inverters","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","flip-flops","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic pulse latch based FSR","low-overhead hardware implementation","cryptographic algorithms","feedback shift registers","flip-flops","Grain-80 stream cipher","maximum clock frequency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of low-overhead implementation of Feedback Shift Registers (FSRs).

Simulation results prove that the algorithm effectively reduce the estimation error, no special requirements on the transmitted signal, and no increasing the transmission bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5647766","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646174/05647766.pdf","startPage":"4333","endPage":"4336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5647766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A semi-blind channel estimation algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647766/","displayDocTitle":"A semi-blind channel estimation algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems","volume":"9","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676521","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5647766/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semi-blind channel estimation algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058517S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5646174","articleId":"5647766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5647770,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation and Electronics Engineering, Qingdao University of science and Technology, Qingdao, China","School of Mechanical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597877300"},{"name":"Jing Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation and Electronics Engineering, Qingdao University of science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600060000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647770","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Character recognition","Artificial neural networks","Pixel","Laser modes","Metals","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","labelling (packaging)","laser beam etching","metals","neural nets","probability","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","hidden Markov model","laser etched character recognition","structural property","metal label character","character extraction","crossing point","probability estimation","state transition sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Hidden Markov models","laser etched characters","three crossing points","characters recognition"]}],"abstract":"A recognition method of laser etched characters based on Hidden Markov models and Neural Network is applied, which the structural properties and the relation of metal label characters are analyzed in detail.

In this paper, given a set of 1-bit flip-flops with the input and output timing constraints, the area constraint inside any partitioned bin and the capacity constraint on any bin edge in a placement plane, an efficient routability-driven approach is proposed to merge 1-bit flip-flops into some multi-bit flip-flops for clock power reduction.

Such issues can be tackled both at the hardware level, by embedding technologies such as TDMA busses, and at the OS level, where suitable scheduling techniques can improve performance and reduce energy consumption. Among these, elastic scheduling has been proved to provide satisfactory results by dynamically reducing task periods at run-time to ensure the highest utilization possible of the processors. On the other hand, elastic scheduling lowers the degree of predictability and increases the complexity of the analysis at the system level. This reduces the benefits given by the TDMA bus, which relies on the high level task analysis for a robust and efficient slot allocation. Starting from this consideration, we propose a system where the elastic scheduling and the TDMA bus work synergistically. We introduce a QoS-aware adaptive bus service which takes the best of both techniques, mitigating their drawbacks at the same time. We show how the overhead introduced by coordination action is small, and it is however dominated by the benefits of the overall strategy in terms of performance and predictability guarantees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675692","htmlLink":"/document/5647792/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive TDMA bus allocation and elastic scheduling: A unified approach for enhancing robustness in multi-core RT systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive TDMA bus allocation and elastic scheduling: A unified approach for enhancing robustness in multi-core RT systems","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"187Burgio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086037S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640356","isNumber":"5647518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640356","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5647518","articleId":"5647792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647797,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Meissner","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Meissner","id":"37595713200"},{"name":"Thomas Gigl","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gigl","id":"37403153600"},{"name":"Klaus Witrisal","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Witrisal","id":"37264939700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5865-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5862-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647797","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":518},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Kalman filters","Equations","Noise","Position measurement","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anchors","Bayes methods","indoor radio","Kalman filters","Monte Carlo methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","position measurement","statistical analysis","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB","indoor localization","position estimation","virtual anchor","Monte Carlo method","Bayesian state estimation","statistical model","Kalman filter","particle filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647797","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2010.5647797","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","abstract":"We present a novel UWB indoor localization concept that performs the position estimation with a set of virtual anchor nodes, generated from a single physical anchor and floor plan information. Using range estimates to the virtual anchors, we perform multilateration to estimate the position of an agent. Previous work has shown the general applicability of this concept. In this contribution, we use a moving agent to exploit the correlation in successive positions using state-space concepts. A motion model for the agent and the measurement likelihood function allow for the use of the powerful framework of Bayesian state estimation. With this concept, we can propagate prior information on the agent position from one time step to the next. The statistical model for the ranging to the virtual anchors accounts for several imperfections, which lead to multimodal and heavy-tailed measurement distributions. We show how modified versions of the Kalman filter as well as a particle filter can account for these imperfections and yield accurate and robust position estimates. In a typical indoor pedestrian motion scenario, we can achieve an accuracy of about 45 cm for 90% of the estimates.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2010.5647797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645818","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637226/5645818/05647797.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB sequential Monte Carlo positioning using virtual anchors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5647797/","displayDocTitle":"UWB sequential Monte Carlo positioning using virtual anchors","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11677849","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB sequential Monte Carlo positioning using virtual anchors","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"Track06Meissner9838469final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065977S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637226","isNumber":"5645818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637226","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5645818","articleId":"5647797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5647807,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenwei Shi","affiliation":["Image Processing Center, School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37536533900"},{"name":"Xueyan Tan","affiliation":["Image Processing Center, School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueyan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37595947600"},{"name":"Zhiguo Jiang","affiliation":["Image Processing Center, School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37405774300"},{"name":"Hongjuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongjuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37600251300"},{"name":"Chonghui Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Chonghui","lastName":"Guo","id":"37590839900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647807","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Correlation","Blind source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Noise","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy blind source separation","nonlinear autocorrelation","source signal","noise-free mixture","noisy model","objective function","Gaussian moment","noisy mixture"]}],"abstract":"When source signals have nonlinear autocorrelation temporal structure, nonlinear autocorrelation has been used as a statistical property for solving blind source separation (BSS) problem (Z.

Although the capacity of (F, K, 2) OOC is significantly increased compared with (F, K, 1) OOC, system synchronization will be weaker than (F, K, 1) OOC. So, (F, K, 1, 2) OOC possesses big capacity and holds good synchronization. In this paper, the method of constructing big capacity (F, K, 1, 2) OOC based on block design is discussed. The algorithm of construction of OOC from block design is presented. The auto-correlation and cross-correlation restricts are set strictly. The algorithm is simulated; several groups of (F, K, 1, 2) OOC are gained. The results show that the algorithm has good astringency and simplicity. It can construct (F, K, 1, 2) OOC effectively.

This work is in fact a combination of ten RBFNNs where each of them is considered as an expert classifier in distinguishing one digit from the others; each RBFNN classifier adapts its input features and its structure including the number of centres and their positions based on a symbiotic approach. The set of characteristic features and RBF centres have been considered as dissimilar species where each of them can benefit from the other, imitating in a simplified way the symbiotic interaction of species in nature. Co-evolution is founded on saving the best weights and centres that give the maximum improvement on the sum of squared error of each RBFNN after a number of learning iterations.

We provide a general maximum likelihood formulation of the positioning problem based on range measurements which can handle synchronous and asynchronous agents. Geometrical constraints on the node topology, which are imposed by the human body, are also taken into account. For a Gaussian ranging error model and the specific problem of arm motion tracking, we derive the maximum likelihood estimation rule and calculate an analytical expression for the unconstrained and constrained Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound. With these results, we study analytically and via computer simulations under what circumstances the geometrical constraints lead to performance gains. It is found that the largest benefits are obtained in case of asynchronous agents and for certain arm positions. Intuitive reasons for this phenomenon are given. Finally, we verify these findings and evaluate the position location performance experimentally with range estimates obtained from measured ultra-wideband channel impulse responses including the impact of the human body.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647912/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11677828","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5647912/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Constrained maximum likelihood positioning for UWB based human motion tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained maximum likelihood positioning for UWB based human motion tracking","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"Track05Mekonnen9872826final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071581S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637226","isNumber":"5645818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637226","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5645818","articleId":"5647912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5647975,"authors":[{"name":"Weifeng Sun","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Dongying, China","School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Weifeng","lastName":"Sun","id":"37599310000"},{"name":"Min Han","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Han","id":"37591472900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647975","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Noise reduction","Signal denoising","Signal to noise ratio","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal denoising","translation invariant wavelet transform","TI wavelet transform","nonlocal signal similarity","correlation","transformed coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["noise reduction","non-local means","wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"A novel signal denoising method combining translation invariant (TI) wavelet transform with non-local signal similarities is developed.

The probabilistic neural networks used for image segmentation is designed in this algorithm. Its input vector consists of image global color features computed by the statistics theory and pixel's gray-values in R, G and B color channels. Its output vector is the binary vector including four elements, and the element with value 1 represents recognized color category. This neural network can divide all pixels of one color image into four types as yellow, red, blue and others. Then the color image will be segmented to the binary image corresponding to given color. To verify the validity of proposed algorithm, it is applied to many natural scene images. Experimental results show the algorithm can efficiently segment object regions of specific colors from color images, and is more adaptable and reliable to natural lighting conditions. The proposed algorithm has important application value in object detection and recognition from natural scene images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5647982/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11675959","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5647982/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An adaptive image segmentation algorithm for natural scene images based on probabilistic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive image segmentation algorithm for natural scene images based on probabilistic neural networks","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063948S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5645820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","xplore-issue":"5645820","articleId":"5647982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5647995,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-chi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Radar Academy of Air force, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yu-chi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537570500"},{"name":"Qiong-hai Dai","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiong-hai","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273514100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5647995","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1086},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Visualization","Target tracking","Cameras","Computer vision","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","aircraft navigation","computer vision","image sequences","remotely operated vehicles","SLAM (robots)","space vehicles","stereo image processing","video surveillance","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision aided unmanned aerial vehicle autonomy","camera on-board unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV senses","environmental information","computer vision techniques","stereo vision","optical flow fields","UAV autonomy","visual servoing technique","UAV flight control","vision-based navigation","aerial surveillance","airborne visual simultaneous localization and mapping","SLAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV autonomy","computer visison","visual servoing","visual navigation","aerial surveillance","airborne visual SLAM"]}],"abstract":"Camera on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is not just a device to capture images and video.

Compressed sampling is considered for signals and images that are sparse in a wavelet basis. We propose a process of the image by sampling the data far below Nyquist rate in terms of compressed sampling, which shows that image data can be reconstructed from an extremely small set of measurements than what is generally considered necessary. A novel wavelet based interframe compression scheme has been developed and put into practice. It is based on a unique block wavelet transform that we have developed. BWT based interframe compression is very efficient in both compression and speed performance. The compression performance of our image codec hold a slightly lower PSNR value produces a more visually pleasing result. This implementation also preserves the scalability of the wavelet embedded coding technique.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5648021","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5645820/05648021.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5648021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645820","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block wavelet transforms of image reconstruction using compressed sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block wavelet transforms of image reconstruction using compressed sampling","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648021/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675970","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648021/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block wavelet transforms of image reconstruction using compressed sampling","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090106S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5645820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","xplore-issue":"5645820","articleId":"5648021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5648038,"authors":[{"name":"Soraya Zaidi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Badji Mokhtar University, Annaba, Algeria"],"firstName":"Soraya","lastName":"Zaidi","id":"37595566300"},{"name":"M-T.

Specifically, the effectiveness of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifiers are implemented. Experiments are conducted using an in-house corpus of Arabic texts. Precision, recall and F-measure are used to quantify categorization effectiveness. The results show that the proposed SVD-Supported MLP/RBF ANN classifier is able to achieve high effectiveness. Experimental results also show that the MLP classifier outperforms the RBF classifier and that the SVD-supported NN classifier is better than the basic NN, as far as Arabic text categorization is concerned.","doi":"10.1109/ICMWI.2010.5648051","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine and Web Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMWI.2010.5648051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5647825","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Machine and Web Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5628557/5647825/05648051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of Neural networks architectures on Arabic text categorization using feature extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648051/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of Neural networks architectures on Arabic text categorization using feature extraction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648051/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11677013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of Neural networks architectures on Arabic text categorization using feature extraction","confLoc":"Algiers, Algeria","sourcePdf":"paper51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066526S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5628557","isNumber":"5647825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5628557","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5647825","articleId":"5648051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5648065,"authors":[{"name":"Suping Deng","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, P.R.China","School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Suping","lastName":"Deng","id":"37596404900"},{"name":"Zidan Chen","affiliation":["School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zidan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597188100"},{"name":"Guohui Ding","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Guohui","lastName":"Ding","id":"37586008700"},{"name":"Yixue Li\u00a7","affiliation":["Bioinformatics Center, Key Lab of Systems Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, P.R.

In this paper, by changing both the fixed point positions of lifting coefficients \u201cLifting Coefficients Shift\u201d and the shifted bits of image signal values \u201cSignal Values Shift\u201d, combining with different rounding methods, we compare the quality of images after 6 levels of CDF9/7 forward and inverse wavelet transform, and find out: When the ratio of \u201cLifting Coefficients Shift\u201d to \u201cSignal Values Shift\u201d is 12:5 with rounding towards +\u221e, it has the best result for fixed point CDF9/7 wavelet transform.

Ambient sound signals are the only information source. Time marks are assigned to the recorded audio stream for distinctive audio events, out of which we evaluate the time differences of arrival (TDOA) between the devices. In contrast to common multilateration approaches we do not need any positional anchor points - neither any predefined smartphone positions nor the positions of the environmental sounds. As an application scenario we can localize arbitrary devices using only the random environmental noise peaks, e.g. in crowded areas like market places or concerts with the usual soundscape, or for thunderstorm tracking. Especially, our solution becomes useful when established positioning systems (e.g. GPS) are too imprecise or fail, as during indoor self-localization. We use a Wi-Fi connection to synchronize the clocks of the devices and to exchange time marks. In our experiments we evaluated the audio information and synchronized the devices up to an order of 0.1 ms. This results in a positioning precision in the order of 10 cm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648094/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11677852","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Self-localization application for iPhone using only ambient sound signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-localization application for iPhone using only ambient sound signals","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"Track05Janson9841387final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065324S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637226","isNumber":"5645818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637226","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5645818","articleId":"5648094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5648131,"authors":[{"name":"Qingwen Han","affiliation":["Department of Electric & Communication, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qingwen","lastName":"Han","id":"37593286400"},{"name":"Vaughan L.

The PAPR analysis for NC-OFDM is unlike that of contiguous OFDM and so mitigation schemes must be modified. We propose an algorithm that combines phase adjustment, interleaving and power back-off in a way that is tailored for NC-OFDM. The proposed algorithm exploits the agility of cognitive radio technology to rapidly choose and employ the appropriate PAPR reduction approach from a set of possibilities to achieve a significant decrease PAPR to a setting threshold. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a large decrease in PAPR, and calculation complexity is low.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5648131","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5623876/5646174/05648131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2010.5648131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5646174","startPage":"4399","endPage":"4403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint algorithm for peak-to-average power reduction of NC-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint algorithm for peak-to-average power reduction of NC-OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648131/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11676534","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648131/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint algorithm for peak-to-average power reduction of NC-OFDM system","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064194S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5623876","isNumber":"5646174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5623876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5646174","articleId":"5648131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648133,"authors":[{"name":"Menouar Boulif","affiliation":["Department of computer science, LIMOSE, University M'hamed Bouguerra at Boumerd\u00e8s, Boumerd\u00e8s, Algeria"],"firstName":"Menouar","lastName":"Boulif","id":"37294560500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8611-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8608-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8610-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5648133","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Redundancy","Blindness","Genetic algorithms","Gallium","Optimization","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","genetic algorithms","graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","encoding representation","graph partitioning problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["graph partitioning","genetic algorithm coding","redundancy and blindness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648133","abstract":"This paper presents an insight on genetic algorithm (GA) encoding representations applied to graph partitioning problems.

The system uses a Wi-Fi positioning technique known as `fingerprinting' to locate users indoors, and GPS to locate users outdoors. Fingerprinting first requires the building up of a database of signal strengths from different Wi-Fi access points taken at different points across the area of interest. Then, the user scans the signal strengths in the wireless network and sends the data to the database, which will find the closest match, and return the likeliest location of the user. Our work investigates different approaches to database generation and fingerprint matching, and their impact on system performance. We find that reducing the time for the survey phase by half does not impact significantly on the final accuracy of the system. The system is also tested outdoors to investigate whether Wi-Fi can challenge GPS for outdoor positioning, and we find that Wi-Fi can match, and sometimes outperform GPS in terms of accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2010.5648250","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637226/5645818/05648250.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5645818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2010.5648250","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sector-based campus-wide indoor positioning system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A sector-based campus-wide indoor positioning system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648250/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648250/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11677865","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sector-based campus-wide indoor positioning system","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"Track03Gallagher9892173final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051193S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637226","isNumber":"5645818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637226","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5645818","articleId":"5648250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5648256,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuxi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599057200"},{"name":"Jinping Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinping","lastName":"Sun","id":"37601092800"},{"name":"Jihua Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jihua","lastName":"Tian","id":"37596023400"},{"name":"Najeeb Ahmad","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Najeeb","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37528861700"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Su","affiliation":["Radar and Avionics Institute of AVIC, Wuxi, China, 214063"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Su","id":"37589202700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6516-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6513-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6515-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5648256","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":906},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar polarimetry","Radar imaging","Image resolution","Imaging","Signal to noise ratio","Synthetic aperture radar","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","microwave imaging","radar imaging","radar resolution","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing SAR imaging","synthetic aperture radar","coherent microwave high resolution imaging system","sparse signal","subNyquist-rate samples","CS based SAR imaging","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","SAR","Imaging"]}],"abstract":"As an active and coherent microwave high resolution imaging system, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the capability to image in all weather and day-or-night conditions.

First, a multiconstrained reduced-order FE observer (RFEO) is proposed to achieve FE for discrete-time T-S fuzzy models with actuator faults. Based on the RFEO, a new fault estimator is constructed. Then, using the information of online FE, a new approach for fault accommodation based on fuzzy-dynamic output feedback is designed to compensate for the effect of faults by stabilizing the closed-loop systems. Moreover, the RFEO and the dynamic output feedback fault-tolerant controller are designed separately, such that their design parameters can be calculated readily. Simulation results are presented to illustrate our contributions.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2095861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5740515/05648342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2095861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5740515","startPage":"291","endPage":"304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Fault Estimation and Accommodation Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems With Actuator Faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Fault Estimation and Accommodation Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems With Actuator Faults","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11903669","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5648342/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Fault Estimation and Accommodation Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems With Actuator Faults","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-jiang-2095861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172278S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5740515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5740515","articleId":"5648342","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5648343,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeongcheol Lee","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeongcheol","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280135400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"5648343","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":116,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","MIMO","Robustness","Backstepping","Uncertainty","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","feedback","fuzzy control","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","adaptive control","fuzzy control","backstepping","MIMO nonlinear systems","multiinput multioutput systems","parametric-strict-feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping technique","fuzzy control","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear system","robust adaptive control"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a robust adaptive control method for a class of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems that are transformable to a parametric-strict-feedback form which has couplings among input channels and the appearance of parametric uncertainties in the input matrices.

Unlike previous robust adaptive fuzzy controls of MIMO nonlinear systems, this research introduces the robustness terms explicitly in the controller structure to counteract the effects of model uncertainties and parameter-adaptation errors.

In this prior, the image gradients are represented by gradient profiles, which are 1-D profiles of gradient magnitudes perpendicular to image structures. We model the gradient profiles by a parametric gradient profile model. Using this model, the prior knowledge of the gradient profiles are learned from a large collection of natural images, which are called gradient profile prior. Based on this prior, we propose a gradient field transformation to constrain the gradient fields of the high resolution image and the enhanced image when performing single image super-resolution and sharpness enhancement. With this simple but very effective approach, we are able to produce state-of-the-art results. The reconstructed high resolution images or the enhanced images are sharp while have rare ringing or jaggy artifacts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5767712/05648351.pdf","startPage":"1529","endPage":"1542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2095871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2095871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient Profile Prior and Its Applications in Image Super-Resolution and Enhancement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Pixel","Image reconstruction","Training","Spatial resolution","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image super-resolution","image enhancement","generic image prior","gradient profile prior","image gradients","image structures","high resolution image","sharpness enhancement","reconstructed high resolution images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gradient field transformation","gradient profile prior","image enhancement","natural image statistics","super- resolution"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Gradient Profile Prior and Its Applications in Image Super-Resolution and Enhancement","volume":"20","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5648351/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12020966","pubMedId":"21118774","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient Profile Prior and Its Applications in Image Super-Resolution and Enhancement","sourcePdf":"tip-sun-2095871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10723S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5767712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"5767712","articleId":"5648351","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5648352,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Tzimiropoulos","affiliation":["Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Tzimiropoulos","id":"37396761900"},{"name":"Vasileios Argyriou","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Argyriou","id":"37285122200"},{"name":"Tania Stathaki","affiliation":["Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Tania","lastName":"Stathaki","id":"37296978800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"5648352","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1697},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648352","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Kernel","Estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Accuracy","Frequency domain analysis","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","image registration","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image subpixel registration","2D gradient correlation matrix","image statistics","image data","LANDSAT","MRI data","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gradient correlation methods","subpixel image registration"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Subtraction Technique"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of subpixel registration of images assumed to be related by a pure translation.

Today, energy range adapted attenuation maps derived from computer tomography (CT) scans are used to effectively compensate for image quality degrading effects, such as attenuation and scatter. Replacing CT by magnetic resonance (MR) is considered as the next evolutionary step in the field of hybrid imaging systems. However, unlike CT, MR does not measure the photon attenuation and thus does not provide an easy access to this valuable information. Hence, many research groups currently investigate different technologies for MR-based attenuation correction (MR-AC). Typically, these approaches are based on techniques such as special acquisition sequences (alone or in combination with subsequent image processing), anatomical atlas registration, or pattern recognition techniques using a data base of MR and corresponding CT images. We propose a generic iterative reconstruction approach to simultaneously estimate the local tracer concentration and the attenuation distribution using the segmented MR image as anatomical reference. Instead of applying predefined attenuation values to specific anatomical regions or tissue types, the gamma attenuation at 511 keV is determined from the PET emission data. In particular, our approach uses a maximum-likelihood estimation for the activity and a gradient-ascent based algorithm for the attenuation distribution. The adverse effects of scattered and accidental gamma coincidences on the quantitative accuracy of PET, as well as artifacts caused by the inherent crosstalk between activity and attenuation estimation are efficiently reduced using enhanced decay event localization provided by time-of-flight PET, accurate correction for accidental coincidences, and a reduced number of unknown attenuation coefficients. First results achieved with measured whole body PET data and reference segmentation from CT showed an absolute mean difference of 0.005 cm in the lungs, 0.0009 cm in case of fat, and 0.0015 cm for muscles and blood. The proposed method indicates a robust and reliable alternative to other MR-AC approaches targeting patient specific quantitative analysis in time-of-flight PET/MR.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2095464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5721862/05648356.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2095464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5721862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation for PET/MR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648356/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation for PET/MR","volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11837880","pubMedId":"21118768","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648356/","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation for PET/MR","sourcePdf":"tmi-salomon-2095464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081876S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5721862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5721862","articleId":"5648356","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5648360,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Ren","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5710128/5648360/5648360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Ren received both the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.

First, we demonstrate how to characterize unweighted graphs in a permutation-invariant manner using the polynomial coefficients from the Ihara zeta function, i.e., the Ihara coefficients. Second, we generalize the definition of the Ihara coefficients to edge-weighted graphs. For an unweighted graph, the Ihara zeta function is the reciprocal of a quasi characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of the associated oriented line graph. Since the Ihara zeta function has poles that give rise to infinities, the most convenient numerically stable representation is to work with the coefficients of the quasi characteristic polynomial. Moreover, the polynomial coefficients are invariant to vertex order permutations and also convey information concerning the cycle structure of the graph. To generalize the representation to edge-weighted graphs, we make use of the reduced Bartholdi zeta function. We prove that the computation of the Ihara coefficients for unweighted graphs is a special case of our proposed method for unit edge weights.

A loop analysis is derived with the AVP technique to show the effects of the right-half-plane (RHP) zero. When the value of RHP zero is above the equivalent series resistance (ESR) zero, constant output impedance can be guaranteed by the proposed compensation method. Once the value of RHP zero is below five times of ESR zero, the proposed ADR technique can vary the droop resistance to track the variation of the load current to increase the system stability. In case of load current variation, the output impedance is proven constant due to the implementation of the AVP technique in the boost converter. The transient response time is 22 \u03bcS when a 200-mA load current step occurs, which is faster than that of a conventional boost converter. Even at heavy loads, the ADR technique can ensure a fast and stable transient response without being affected by the RHP zero. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can increase system stability and guarantee a fast transient response in the design of a boost converter with the AVP technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Droop Resistance Technique for Adaptive Voltage Positioning in Boost DC\u2013DC Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095508","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5975345/05648361.pdf","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5975345","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Droop Resistance Technique for Adaptive Voltage Positioning in Boost DC\u2013DC Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12205309","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Droop Resistance Technique for Adaptive Voltage Positioning in Boost DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2095508-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034802S","chronDate":"July  2011","isNumber":"5975345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"49","articleId":"5648361","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5648363,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6112283/5648363/5648363-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Zhang was born in China, in 1982.

In this paper, a novel dc-bus voltage switched control method of three-phase voltage source pulsewidth-modulated rectifiers (VSRs), which aims to solve the problem of flexible voltage regulating under dynamic loads, is proposed under a cascade structure in rotating synchronous coordinates d-q . Several linear controllers are designed on different operating points of the VSR, and one controller is implemented on the VSR system according to certain switching law. The stability of the proposed control approach is guaranteed based on the common Lyapunov function method. Simulation and experimental results show that the desired control performance is obtained in the voltage regulating of a VSR with wide-range rapidly varying load. Compared with a classical PI controller, the derived switched controller can achieve a considerable reduction in the dip of the dc-bus voltage and a certain reduction in the overshoot of the dc-bus voltage during the control process under an aircraft electric actuator load.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched Control of Three-Phase Voltage Source PWM Rectifier Under a Wide-Range Rapidly Varying Active Load","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095507","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6112283/05648363.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Switched Control of Three-Phase Voltage Source PWM Rectifier Under a Wide-Range Rapidly Varying Active Load","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5648363/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12436956","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched Control of Three-Phase Voltage Source PWM Rectifier Under a Wide-Range Rapidly Varying Active Load","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2095507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084424S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6112283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6112283","articleId":"5648363","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5648364,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

Exposure measurements are initiated and carried out locally by the individual pixel that has detected a change of brightness in its field-of-view. Pixels do not rely on external timing signals and independently and asynchronously request access to an (asynchronous arbitrated) output channel when they have new grayscale values to communicate. Pixels that are not stimulated visually do not produce output. The visual information acquired from the scene, temporal contrast and grayscale data, are communicated in the form of asynchronous address-events (AER), with the grayscale values being encoded in inter-event intervals. The pixel-autonomous and massively parallel operation ideally results in lossless video compression through complete temporal redundancy suppression at the pixel level. Compression factors depend on scene activity and peak at ~1000 for static scenes. Due to the time-based encoding of the illumination information, very high dynamic range - intra-scene DR of 143 dB static and 125 dB at 30 fps equivalent temporal resolution - is achieved. A novel time-domain correlated double sampling (TCDS) method yields array FPN of <;0.25% rms. SNR is >56 dB (9.3 bit) for >10 Lx illuminance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648367/","volume":"46","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5648367/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11704580","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A QVGA 143 dB Dynamic Range Frame-Free PWM Image Sensor With Lossless Pixel-Level Video Compression and Time-Domain CDS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QVGA 143 dB Dynamic Range Frame-Free PWM Image Sensor With Lossless Pixel-Level Video Compression and Time-Domain CDS","sourcePdf":"jssc-posch-2085952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104843S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5673672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"327","xplore-issue":"5673672","articleId":"5648367","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648370,"authors":[{"name":"Amin M.

When driven by WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 MHz signals, the overall PAE of our ET-based polar TX system reaches 30.5% at 17 dBm average output power, while also meeting the stringent WiMAX linearity specs without using any predistortion. When the decresting algorithm using the soft limiter is applied to the baseband, the overall PAE increases to 33%, at the expense of a higher EVM of 4.9%.

The slave system is modelled by an unknown input observer in which, the unknown input is the transmitted information. As in the general observer-based synchronization paradigm, the information is recovered if the master and slave systems robustly synchronize. In the context of unknown-input observers, this is tantamount to estimating the master's states and the unknown inputs. The set-up also considers the presence of perturbations in the chaotic transmitter dynamics and in the output equations (the transmitted signal). That is, the estimator (slave system) must synchronize albeit noisy measurements and reject the effect of perturbations on the transmitter dynamics. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization to take place. To highlight our contribution, we also present some simulation results with the purpose of comparing the proposed method to classical adaptive observer-based synchronization (without disturbance rejection). It is shown that additive noise is perfectly canceled and the encoded message is well recovered despite the perturbations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2089547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739679","startPage":"800","endPage":"812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5739679/05648390.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Unknown-Input Observers-Based Synchronization of Chaotic Systems for Telecommunication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648390/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Unknown-Input Observers-Based Synchronization of Chaotic Systems for Telecommunication","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11903662","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Unknown-Input Observers-Based Synchronization of Chaotic Systems for Telecommunication","sourcePdf":"tcsi-loria-2089547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.21948S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5739679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5739679","articleId":"5648390","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5648391,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Mirzaei","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5756263/5648391/5648391-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Mirzaei (M'06) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2006.","He is currently a Principal Scientist at Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA.

The proposed receiver implements the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as a vector-matrix multiplier using floating-gate transistors on a field-programmable analog array (FPAA). The DFT coefficients can be tuned to counteract an inherent device mismatch by adjusting the amount of electrical charge stored in the floating-gate transistors. When compared to a digital field-programmable gate array implementation, the analog FPAA implementation of the DFT reduces power consumption at the cost of a slight performance degradation. Considering the errors in the DFT coefficients as intersymbol interference, the performance degradation can be further mitigated by employing a least mean-square or minimum mean-square-error equalizer.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5702426/05648392.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5702426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power Discrete Fourier Transform for OFDM: A Programmable Analog Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648392/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Discrete Fourier Transform for OFDM: A Programmable Analog Approach","volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11792348","htmlLink":"/document/5648392/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Discrete Fourier Transform for OFDM: A Programmable Analog Approach","sourcePdf":"tcsi-suh-2071950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104031S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5702426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5702426","articleId":"5648392","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648395,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppina Sapone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e dei Sistemi, Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Catania, Catania, Italy","Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5730005/5648395/5648395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giuseppina Sapone (S'05\u2013M'09) received the Laurea and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","Since 2004, she has been with the Radio Frequency Advanced Design Center (RF ADC), a joint research group supported by the University of Catania and STMicroelectronics, where she was involved in the design and development of RF circuits for 3\u201310-GHz UWB applications.

Under this communication paradigm, the choice of a relay node (among a set of available relay nodes) is critical in the overall network performance. In this paper, we study the relay node assignment problem in a cooperative ad hoc network environment, where multiple source-destination pairs compete for the same pool of relay nodes in the network. Our objective is to assign the available relay nodes to different source-destination pairs so as to maximize the minimum data rate among all pairs. The main contribution of this paper is the development of an optimal polynomial time algorithm, called ORA, that achieves this objective. A novel idea in this algorithm is a \u201clinear marking\u201d mechanism, which maintains linear complexity of each iteration. We give a formal proof of optimality for ORA and use numerical results to demonstrate its capability.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2091148","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5875977/05648397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2091148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5875977","startPage":"879","endPage":"892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Algorithm for Relay Node Assignment in Cooperative Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Algorithm for Relay Node Assignment in Cooperative Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12060301","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5648397/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Algorithm for Relay Node Assignment in Cooperative Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-hou-2091148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129849S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5875977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5875977","articleId":"5648397","onlineDate":"29 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5648445,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Javier Bejarano","affiliation":["Engineering Faculty, Division of Electrical Engineering, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Mexico"],"firstName":"Francisco Javier","lastName":"Bejarano","id":"37299685000"},{"name":"Alessandro Pisano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Pisano","id":"37284690500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5648445","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":125,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1791},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Observers","Equations","Linear systems","Stability analysis","Lyapunov method","Switched systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","observers","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state observer synthesis","switched linear system","switching subsystem","reduced order unknown input switched observer","LMI","unknown input distribution matrices","asymptotic state reconstruction","slow switching dwell time constraint","switching sequence","Lyapunov analysis","state estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Strong detectability","switched linear systems","unknown-input observers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648445","abstract":"Two state observers are designed for some classes of switched linear systems with unknown inputs. The design of the proposed observers assumes that all switching subsystems fulfill a property of \u201cstrong detectability\u201d that allows to implement suitable reduced-order unknown-input switched observers. The synthesis of the observers is based on the feasibility of a certain system of LMIs. Two main schemes are presented. For the case when the set of possible unknown-input distribution matrices are linearly dependent, an observer is suggested that guarantees the asymptotic state reconstruction without imposing any slow-switching dwell-time constraint about the sequence of the switching times.

By appropriate Lyapunov analysis, the convergence of the state estimate is proven to be exponential in both cases.

We consider two transceiver schemes, both of which require no channel state information at either the transmitter or the receiver. The first one employs a distinct chaotic sequence at each transmit antenna to spread the same data symbol and transmits omnidirectionally. At each receive antenna, the corresponding differential detection statistic is formed, and these statistics are then combined with equal gain for symbol detection. The second scheme employs a single chaotic spreading sequence and makes use of adaptive transmit and receive beamforming. The beamformers are updated by using a simple stochastic gradient method that is based on the received signal power and a finite-rate feedback strategy. Simulation results show that both schemes can effectively exploit the spatial diversity of the underlying MIMO system, and the adaptive beamforming scheme significantly outperforms the omnidirectional transmission.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2083091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2083091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5667084/05648457.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"--DCSK-Based Chaotic Communications in MIMO Multipath Channels With No Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex></formula>-DCSK-Based Chaotic Communications in MIMO Multipath Channels With No Channel State Information","volume":"57","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648457/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11693129","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648457/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex></formula>-DCSK-Based Chaotic Communications in MIMO Multipath Channels With No Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wang-2083091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06383S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5667084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5667084","articleId":"5648457","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5648468,"authors":[{"name":"Masood Qazi","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5673672/5648468/5648468-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masood Qazi (S'06) is a Ph.D. candidate with the Microsystems Technology Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The corresponding optimization problem is combinatorial with complex practical constraints that can vary with time. This paper provides a new formulation of generator start-up sequencing as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The linear formulation leads to an optimal solution to this important problem that clearly outperforms heuristic or enumerative techniques in quality of solutions or computational speed. The proposed generator start-up strategy is intended to provide an initial starting sequence of all BS or NBS units. The method can provide updates on the system MW generation capability as the restoration process progresses. The IEEE 39-Bus system, American Electric Power (AEP), and Entergy test cases are used for validation of the generation capability optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MILP-based generator start-up sequencing algorithm is highly efficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05648472.pdf","startPage":"1357","endPage":"1366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2089646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2089646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Generator Start-Up Strategy for Bulk Power System Restoration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","NIST","Optimization","Power system restoration","Sun","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric generators","integer programming","linear programming","power system restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal generator start-up strategy","bulk power system restoration","black-start units","NBS units","nonblack-start units","optimization problem","mixed integer linear programming problem","MILP problem","linear formulation","heuristic techniques","enumerative techniques","MW generation","AEP","IEEE 39-bus system","MILP-based generator start-up sequencing algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generation capability","global optimization","mixed integer linear programming","power system restoration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Generator Start-Up Strategy for Bulk Power System Restoration","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5648472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12135599","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Generator Start-Up Strategy for Bulk Power System Restoration","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-sun-2089646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092333S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5648472","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":5648491,"authors":[{"name":"Vishwanath Natarajan","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Vishwanath Natarajan is a test R&D engineer at Intel.

The parameter uncertainties are considered to be norm-bounded, and the stochastic perturbations are described in terms of Brownian motion. Defective statistics means that the transition probabilities of the multimode neural networks are not exactly known, as assumed usually. The scenario is more practical, and such defective transition probabilities comprise three types: known, uncertain, and unknown. By invoking the property of the transition probability matrix and the convexity of uncertain domains, a sufficient stability criterion for the underlying system is derived. Furthermore, a monotonicity is observed concerning the maximum value of a given scalar, which bounds the stochastic perturbation that the system can tolerate as the level of the defectiveness varies. Numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the developed results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11742250","pubMedId":"21134815","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5648729/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Stability Criterion for Discrete-Time Uncertain Markovian Jumping Neural Networks With Defective Statistics of Modes Transitions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Stability Criterion for Discrete-Time Uncertain Markovian Jumping Neural Networks With Defective Statistics of Modes Transitions","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhang-2093151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123759S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5680555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5680555","articleId":"5648729","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5648734,"authors":[{"name":"Houman Homayoun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Houman Homayoun (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2003 from Sharif University of technology, Tehran, Iran, the M.S. degree in computer engineering in 2005 from University of Victoria, BC, Canada, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the University of California Irvine in 2010.","Dr. Homayoun was named a 2010 National Science Foundation Computing Innovation Fellow by the Computing Research Association (CRA) and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC).

In addition, as technology migrates to smaller geometries, leakage contribution to total power consumption increases faster than dynamic power, indicating that leakage will be a major contributor to overall power consumption. This paper presents zig-zag share, a circuit technique to reduce leakage in SRAM peripherals by putting them into low-leakage power sleep mode. The zig-zag share circuit is further extended to enable multiple sleep modes for cache peripherals. Each mode represents a trade-off between leakage reduction and the wakeup delay. Using architectural control of multiple sleep modes, an integrated technique called MSleep-Share is proposed and applied in L1 and L2 caches. MSleep-share relies on cache miss information to guide leakage control mechanism and switch peripheral circuit's power mode. The results show leakage reduction by up to 40\u00d7 in deeply pipelined SRAM peripheral circuits, with small area overhead and small additional delay. This noticeable leakage reduction translates to up to 85% overall leakage reduction in on-chip memories.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648734/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12328185","volume":"19","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MZZ-HVS: Multiple Sleep Modes Zig-Zag Horizontal and Vertical Sleep Transistor Sharing to Reduce Leakage Power in On-Chip SRAM Peripheral Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MZZ-HVS: Multiple Sleep Modes Zig-Zag Horizontal and Vertical Sleep Transistor Sharing to Reduce Leakage Power in On-Chip SRAM Peripheral Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-homayoun-2086500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112736S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6059694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6059694","articleId":"5648734","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648735,"authors":[{"name":"Qiming Hou","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Sigma Building, Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/5714210/5648735/5648735-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiming Hou received the BS degree in the Academic Talent Program of Tsinghua University (Mainland China) in 2006 and is currently working toward the PhD degree in computer science at Tsinghua University (Mainland China).

While being able to exploit the massive parallelism on the GPU, the BFS order also consumes excessive GPU memory, which becomes a serious issue for interactive applications involving very complex models with more than a few million triangles. In this paper, we propose to use the partial breadth-first search (PBFS) construction order to control memory consumption while maximizing performance. We apply the PBFS order to two hierarchy construction algorithms. The first algorithm is for kd-trees that automatically balances between the level of parallelism and intermediate memory usage. With PBFS, peak memory consumption during construction can be efficiently controlled without costly CPU-GPU data transfer. We also develop memory allocation strategies to effectively limit memory fragmentation. The resulting algorithm scales well with GPU memory and constructs kd-trees of models with millions of triangles at interactive rates on GPUs with 1 GB memory. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithm is an order of magnitude more scalable for a given GPU memory bound. The second algorithm is for out-of-core bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) construction for very large scenes based on the PBFS construction order. At each iteration, all constructed nodes are dumped to the CPU memory, and the GPU memory is freed for the next iteration's use. In this way, the algorithm is able to build trees that are too large to be stored in the GPU memory. Experiments show that our algorithm can construct BVHs for scenes with up to 20 M triangles, several times larger than previous GPU algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5714210/05648735.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5714210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory-Scalable GPU Spatial Hierarchy Construction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Memory management","Algorithm design and analysis","Parallel processing","Ray tracing","Layout","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","storage management","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU spatial hierarchy construction","graphics processing unit","breadth-first search construction order","memory consumption","kd-trees algorithm","memory allocation strategy","bounding volume hierarchy construction","memory-scalable GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memory bound","kd-tree","bounding volume hierarchy."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Memory-Scalable GPU Spatial Hierarchy Construction","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5648735/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11832495","pubMedId":"20530816","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory-Scalable GPU Spatial Hierarchy Construction","sourcePdf":"ttg2011040466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057632S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5714210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5714210","articleId":"5648735","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648740,"authors":[{"name":"Zaili Wang","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Institute, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zaili","lastName":"Wang","id":"37598008600"},{"name":"Zhiyong Feng","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Institute, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37536937000"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Institute, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5648740","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1090},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648740","abstract":"Coordinated spectrum sensing ensures Cognitive Radio systems to get the usability of every channel within the entire spectrum of interest by assigning terminals to detect different channels simultaneously.

The analysis is based on the Kronecker correlated fading model where the correlation properties of the MIMO channel are modeled at the transmitter and receiver ends separately. Our first main contribution is the derivation of the asymptotic mutual information expressions for the MIMO-AF relay channel for any given signaling input distributions (not necessarily Gaussian) in the large-system regime, which is particularly relevant if practical modulation schemes are used. In addition to the formula that uses joint optimal decoding (JOD) at the DT, we also obtain the asymptotic result for a more practical system which performs separate detection and decoding (SDD) (i.e., spatial detection followed by a temporal error-correction decoder). Another major contribution of this paper is an efficient algorithm that can compute the optimal source covariance matrix and the relay precoding matrix to maximize the asymptotic mutual information of the MIMO-AF relay system if channel covariance information (CCI) is known at the ST and RT.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.111710.090516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5713793/05648744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.111710.090516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713793","startPage":"590","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Asymptotic Properties of Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Asymptotic Properties of Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807426","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5648744/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Asymptotic Properties of Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"590-tc1102-wen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150588S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5713793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5713793","articleId":"5648744","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648746,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-Sung Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea","Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu-Sung","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37403878000"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["KAUST, Makkah, Saudi Arabia","Electrical and Computer Engineering Program, Texas A and M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5648746","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1486},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation","Protocols","Fading","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","amplify and forward communication","diversity reception","relays","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","two way amplify and forward relaying","adaptive modulation","multiple relay network","spectral efficiency","relayed communication system","relay node","relay selection","signal-to-noise ratio","error rate requirement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relaying","amplify-and-forward relaying","best relay selection and adaptive modulation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose two-way amplify-and-forward relaying in conjunction with adaptive modulation in order to improve spectral efficiency of relayed communication systems while monitoring the required error performance.

In particular, our contribution is twofold, i) First, we propose a very general framework for computing the Average Bit Error Probability (ABEP) of SSK-MIMO systems over a generic Rician fading channel with arbitrary correlation and channel parameters. The framework relies upon the Moschopoulos method. We show that it is exact for MIMO systems with two transmit-antenna and arbitrary receive-antenna, while an asymptotically-tight upper-bound is proposed to handle the system setup with an arbitrary number of transmit-antenna. ii) Second, moving from the consideration that conventional SSK-MIMO schemes can offer only receive-diversity gains, we propose a novel SSK-MIMO scheme that can exploit the transmit-antenna to increase the diversity order. The new method has its basic foundation on the transmission of signals with good time-correlation properties, and is called Time-Orthogonal-Signal-Design (TOSD-) assisted SSK modulation (TOSD-SSK). It is shown that the proposed method can increase twofold the diversity order for arbitrary transmit- and receive-antenna.

We show that our schemes outperform conventional cooperation in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Specifically, it can offer the maximum diversity order at the expense of a slightly reduced multiplexing rate. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the maximum diversity order. We show that when the parity-check matrix for a systematic maximum distance separable (MDS) code is used as the network coding matrix, the maximum diversity is achieved. We present two ways to generate full-diversity network coding matrices: namely using the Cauchy matrices and the Vandermonde matrices.

However, several practical systems employ single-carrier transmission over frequency-selective channels and the design of corresponding relaying schemes is a largely under-explored topic. In this paper, we investigate filter-and-forward beamforming (FF-BF) for relay networks employing single-carrier transmission over frequency-selective channels. In contrast to prior work, we assume that the destination node is equipped with a simple linear or decision feedback equalizer. The FF-BF filters at the relays are optimized for maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio at the equalizer output under a joint relay power constraint. For infinite impulse response (IIR) FF-BF filters, we derive a unified expression for the filter frequency response valid for linear equalization, decision feedback equalization, and an idealized matched filter receiver. A numerical algorithm with guaranteed convergence is developed for optimization of the power allocation factor included in the expression for the IIR FF-BF filter frequency response. We also provide an efficient gradient algorithm for recursive calculation of near-optimal finite impulse response (FIR) FF-BF filters. Simulation results show that, in general, short FIR FF-BF filters are sufficient to closely approach the performance of IIR FF-BF filters even in severely frequency-selective channels and that the proposed FF-BF scheme with equalization at the destination achieves substantial performance gains compared to a previously proposed FF-BF scheme without equalization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Filter-and-Forward Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Channels with Equalization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100296","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05648765.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Filter-and-Forward Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Channels with Equalization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5648765/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742933","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Filter-and-Forward Beamforming for Frequency-Selective Channels with Equalization","sourcePdf":"228-tw1101-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080821S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5648765","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-31"},{"_id":5648766,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Chieh","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280673400"},{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Kai","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280263500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5648766","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1632},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Convergence","MIMO","Complexity theory","Protocols","Optimization","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antennas","computational complexity","entropy","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-optimal relay subset selection","two-way amplify-and-forward MIMO relaying systems","two-way channel","antennas","computational complexity","cross-entropy method","CE method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-entropy method","relay subset selection","sum-rate","two-way channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the relay subset selection problem in a two-way amplify-and-forward relay network, where each user is equipped with multiple antennas and each relay is equipped with a single antenna. In a two-way channel, two users exchange data with each other using a relay subset. With the optimal relay subset selection scheme, the system can reduce the hardware burden while preserving the diversity benefit. However, the optimal relay subset selection algorithm requires an exhaustive search of all possible combinations to determine the optimum subset in order to achieve the maximum sum-rate. Thus, this results in high computational complexity. In order to reduce the computational load while still maximizing the achievable rate, a cross-entropy (CE) method is introduced to search for the optimal relay subset. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CE method can guarantee a result that is within 98% of the optimum sum-rate obtained by the exhaustive search method with low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05648766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimal Relay Subset Selection for Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Relay Subset Selection for Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742907","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5648766/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Optimal Relay Subset Selection for Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"037-tw1101-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080314S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5648766","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5648767,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongliang Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5648767/5648767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongliang Liang received his B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China in 2008 and MASc degree from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 2010.

Designing a WSN based on cognitive radio can be promising in the near future in order to provide data transmissions with quality of service requirements. In this paper we introduce a cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) and analyze its performance for supporting real-time traffic. The network opportunistically accesses vacant channels in the licensed spectrum. When the current channel becomes unavailable, the devices can switch to another available channel. Two types of channel switchings are considered, in periodic switching (PS) the devices can switch to a new channel only at the beginning of each channel switching (CS) interval, while in triggered switching (TS) the devices can switch to a new channel as soon as the current channel is lost. We consider two types of real-time traffic, i) a burst of packets are generated periodically and the number of packets in each burst is random, and ii) packet arrivals follow a Poisson process. We derive the average packet transmission delay for each type of the traffic and channel switching mechanisms. Our results indicate that real-time traffic can be effectively supported in the CRSN with small average packet transmission delay. For the network using PS, packets with the Poisson arrivals experience longer average delay than the bursty arrivals; while for the network using TS, packets with the bursty arrivals experience longer average delay.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05648767.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Performance Analysis for Supporting Real-Time Traffic in a Cognitive Radio Sensor Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","displayDocTitle":"Delay Performance Analysis for Supporting Real-Time Traffic in a Cognitive Radio Sensor Network","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742900","htmlLink":"/document/5648767/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Performance Analysis for Supporting Real-Time Traffic in a Cognitive Radio Sensor Network","sourcePdf":"325-tw1101-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117139S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5648767","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648770,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Zhou","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37402649100"},{"name":"Jie Gong","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Gong","id":"37402747500"},{"name":"Zhisheng Niu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Niu","id":"37269009300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5648770","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1185},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","Quantization","Resource management","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","interference suppression","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback adaptation","quantized feedback","downlink network MIMO systems","quantized channel state information","feedback set","interference mitigation","feedback bit budgets","base station coordination","cochannel interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network MIMO","base station coordination","limited feedback","co-channel interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on quantized channel state information (CSI) feedback for downlink network MIMO systems.

The novel method of coherent or differentially coherent detection of chirp pulses in multipath channels is introduced. The method divides detection in the receiver between its analog and digital part; in the analog part of the receiver, received signal is compressed in frequency by mixing with locally generated chirp pulse and low-pass filtering. In this way, the time-bandwidth (TB) product of the resulting signal is reduced compared to the received signal and made approximately independent of duration of the transmitted signal. This results in relatively low complexity digital back-end of the receiver that is able to capture a large portion of the multipath energy, regardless of duration of the transmitted waveform. The work includes derivation of analytical properties of the system, including derivation of loss parameters that quantify system multipath performance. Numerical results include discussion on the system multipath loss performance with varying chirp duration. As well, a comparison is made with error performance of sampling receivers featuring the same computational complexity. Analysis of the robustness of the system's performance to different chirp pulse implementation errors is also provided.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05648778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.111910.100246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","startPage":"208","endPage":"218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Chirp Pulsed Ultra-Wideband System with Near-Optimum Multipath Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Chirp Pulsed Ultra-Wideband System with Near-Optimum Multipath Performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742932","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5648778/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Chirp Pulsed Ultra-Wideband System with Near-Optimum Multipath Performance","sourcePdf":"208-tw1101-dotlic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092122S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5648778","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5648779,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Giannetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5648779/5648779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Filippo Giannetti was born in Pontedera, Italy, on September 16, 1964.

In this letter, we are concerned with the existence of secure connections from a typical transmitter to the legitimate receiver(s) over fading channels, where the legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers are all randomly located. We consider non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers, and derive the network secure connectivity for both eavesdropper strategies. We mathematically show how nodes with multiple transmit antenna elements can improve secure connectivity by forming a directional antenna or using eigen-beamforming. Compared with single antenna transmission, a large connectivity improvement can be achieved by both multi-antenna transmission techniques even with a small number of antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Wireless Network Connectivity with Multi-Antenna Transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.112310.101008","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05648780.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.112310.101008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","displayDocTitle":"Secure Wireless Network Connectivity with Multi-Antenna Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5648780/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","publicationDate":"February 2011","accessionNumber":"11805079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Wireless Network Connectivity with Multi-Antenna Transmission","sourcePdf":"425-tw1102-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075891S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5648780","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5648781,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Choqueuse","affiliation":["Laboratory-STICC, UEB, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Brest, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5711712/5648781/5648781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Choqueuse (S'08-M'09) was born in 1981 in Brest, France.

The proposed method exploits the statistical independence of sources before space-time encoding. The channel matrix is estimated by minimizing a kurtosis-based cost function after Zero-Forcing equalization. In contrast to subspace or Second-Order Statistics (SOS) approaches, the proposed method is more general since it can be employed for the general class of linear STBCs including Spatial Multiplexing, Orthogonal, quasi-Orthogonal and Non-Orthogonal STBCs. Furthermore, unlike other approaches, the method does not require any modification of the transmitter and, consequently, is well-suited for non-cooperative context. Numerical examples corroborate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.112310.091576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5711712","startPage":"495","endPage":"505","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5711712/05648781.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.112310.091576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation for STBC Systems Using Higher-Order Statistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Cost function","Receivers","Encoding","Blind equalizers","Transmitters","Higher order statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","higher order statistics","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","space division multiplexing","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","higher-order statistics","space-time block coded system","statistical independence","space-time encoding","channel matrix estimation","kurtosis-based cost function","zero-forcing equalization","subspace approach","second-order statistics approach","linear STBC","spatial multiplexing","quasi-orthogonal STBC","nonOrthogonal STBC","transmitter","noncooperative context","MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","space time coding","channel estimation","independent component analysis","higher-order statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation for STBC Systems Using Higher-Order Statistics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5648781/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11805080","publicationDate":"February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Channel Estimation for STBC Systems Using Higher-Order Statistics","sourcePdf":"495-tw1102-choqueuse.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114169S","chronDate":"February  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5711712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5711712","articleId":"5648781","onlineDate":"03 December 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5648782,"authors":[{"name":"Namyoon Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Namyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37403846100"},{"name":"Wonjae Shin","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonjae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37595072100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5648782","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Quantization","Array signal processing","Interference","Upper bound","Antennas","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive feedback scheme","K-cell MISO interfering broadcast channel","limited feedback","finite rate feedback","quantization error","coordinated zero-forcing beamforming","random vector quantization method","feedback bits allocation methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive feedback","multicell interfering broadcast channel","multiple antennas"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a K-cell multiple input single-output interfering broadcast channel (MISO-IFBC) with finite rate feedback.

This power gain is increased as the time difference between signals arriving to the receiver from different terminals goes up.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648808/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11688200","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time synchronization in amplify-and-forward cooperative communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time synchronization in amplify-and-forward cooperative communication systems","confLoc":"Diyarbakir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"2010129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046563S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5636061","isNumber":"5648807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5636061","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648807","articleId":"5648808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5648838,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Schmitz","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK","Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Schmitz","id":"37587110100"},{"name":"Marco Maggiali","affiliation":["Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Maggiali","id":"37295800800"},{"name":"Lorenzo Natale","affiliation":["Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Natale","id":"37542770000"},{"name":"Bruno Bonino","affiliation":["Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Bonino","id":"37590932800"},{"name":"Giorgio Metta","affiliation":["Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy","Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Metta","id":"37295477800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5648838","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Probes","Humanoid robots","Capacitive sensors","Sensor systems","Pressure measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive sensors","humanoid robots","manipulators","pressure sensors","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactile sensor","humanoid robot iCub","object manipulation","robotic finger","capacitive pressure system","capacitive sensor","soft silicone foam","size 14.5 mm","size 13 mm"]}],"abstract":"In order to successfully perform object manipulation, humanoid robots must be equipped with tactile sensors.

If the optimal DMT performance of each coded stream can be achieved, then such code is said to be successive refinable. For the cases of SISO, SIMO, and MISO Rayleigh slow fading channels, Diggavi and Tse had shown that superposition coding with successive cancellation receiver achieves successive refinability in these channels. However, such optimality might not be extended to MIMO channel due to the strictly sub-optimality of successive cancellation receiver.

We then show that the proposed code is approximately universal, if joint ML decoding is used, and hence extend the notion of successive refinability to general MIMO channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5648877","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05648877.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5648877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximately universal MIMO diversity embedded codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648877/","displayDocTitle":"Approximately universal MIMO diversity embedded codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732811","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648877/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximately universal MIMO diversity embedded codes","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"5c11569293581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062559S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5648877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5648879,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In order to strengthen our understanding of what is required to locate PD by this method, it is important to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves from PD in transformers. This paper is concerned with ultra-high frequency (UHF) PD signal propagation in power transformers in the presence of conducting obstacles, which may represent the core, winding or other internal structures. The approach is to use the FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) method which can model the propagation of electromagnetic waves and their interactions with the structure of materials. FDTD is a technique widely used in microwave and radio frequency applications. Being a time domain method, it is particularly suitable for modelling the time-of-flight PD location problem. A 3D geometry has been created to represent a simple oil-filled tank containing a PD source, UHF sensor and an obstacle to line-of-sight UHF signal propagation. The effect of obstacles in delaying the arrival time and attenuating the leading edge of the signal is assessed. Implications of the results for accurate PD location by the UHF method are discussed and further improvements to the modelling study are proposed.","publicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","displayPublicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637220/5648789/05648891.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648789","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of UHF partial discharge signal propagation in power transformers using FDTD modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study of UHF partial discharge signal propagation in power transformers using FDTD modelling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648891/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688029","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648891/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of UHF partial discharge signal propagation in power transformers using FDTD modelling","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"A43135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044794S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637220","isNumber":"5648789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637220","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648789","articleId":"5648891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Cardiff University","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5648900,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bauer","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37588517200"},{"name":"Giulio Milighetti","affiliation":["System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB, Fraunhofer Institute of Optronics, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Milighetti","id":"37565227000"},{"name":"Wenjie Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Yan","id":"37598075500"},{"name":"Ralf Mikut","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Mikut","id":"37271890000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6676-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6674-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6675-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"5648900","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Sensors","Robots","Grasping","Biomembranes","Computational modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","manipulator dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-like reflexes","robotic manipulation","leaky integrate-and-fire neurons","humanoid robots","human centered environments","safety strategies","safety aspect"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-like reflexes for robotic manipulation using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons","abstract":"In this paper we present an approach to transfer human-like reflex behavior to robots by utilizing leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.

To achieve such human-like reflexes a general reflex unit, based on special variants of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model has been built.

The actuator presented in this work can independently control equilibrium position and stiffness by two motors. The first motor controls the equilibrium position while the second motor regulates the compliance. The novelty of the proposed design with respect to the existing systems is on the principle used to regulate the compliance. This is done not through the tuning of the pretension of the elastic element as in the majority of existing system but by controlling the fixation of the elastic elements (springs) using a linear drive. An important consequence of this approach is that the displacement needed to change the stiffness is perpendicular to the forces generated by the springs, thus this helps to minimize the energy/power required to change the stiffness. This permits the use of a small motor for the stiffness adjustment resulting in a lighter setup. Experimental results are presented to show the ability of AwAS to control position and regulate the stiffness independently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689279","htmlLink":"/document/5648902/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel actuator with adjustable stiffness (AwAS)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel actuator with adjustable stiffness (AwAS)","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041578S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5648902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5648910,"authors":[{"name":"James Brooks","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Brooks","id":"37603799900"},{"name":"Rod Dunn","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, UK"],"firstName":"Rod","lastName":"Dunn","id":"37341214800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9565570-2-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7667-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9565570-0-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5648910","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Monte Carlo methods","Generators","Computational modeling","Load modeling","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric power generation","Monte Carlo methods","power system reliability","power system security","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security assessment schemes","two-stage Monte Carlo sampling","power flow","probabilistic uncertainty","variable renewable generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Power system reliability","Power system security","Power system simulation","IEEE Reliability Test System","Sustainable Power Generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648789","publicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","displayPublicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637220/5648789/05648910.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing security assessment schemes through two-stage Monte Carlo sampling","abstract":"The penetration of unscheduleable generation will increase due to legislation and eventually saving on fuel cost.

Though there has been a lot of work into probabilistic security assessment there has been far less on comparing security assessment schemes. This work uses two stage Monte Carlo sampling to generate a data set which can be used for easy comparison between different schemes.

In order to use batteries more efficiently, their response to various operating conditions must be understood. There are many ways to define battery capacity include: rated capacity, SOC and BAC. Knowing the battery available capacity (BAC) in electric vehicles (EVs) is very important issue. BAC depends on discharge current and battery temperature for different kinds of battery but there is no exact relationship between BAC and discharge current in various temperatures. Recently neural networks have been successful used for power system applications. In the literature, there are many neural networks for power system applications. However, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function (RBF) have demonstrated better capabilities. This paper presents two neural networks (RBF and MLP) for estimation of Lead-Acid BAC. The main contribution of this paper is consideration of temperature effect in BAC calculation. In addition, the results of RBF and MLP are compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648954/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11679067","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5648954/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network method for estimation of battery available capacity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network method for estimation of battery available capacity","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"H314334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068909S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637220","isNumber":"5648789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637220","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648789","articleId":"5648954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Cardiff University","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5648959,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Senger","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Senger","id":"37543557400"},{"name":"Vladimir R.

This was answered before for the case of fixed erasing, where only the channel state and not the individual symbol reliabilities of each received vector are taken into consideration.

However, the joint coding is not always optimal because its achievable channel capacity (i.e. the maximum data rate) is inversely proportional to the dynamic range of the channel. In this paper, we propose a novel cross coding scheme to increase the maximum data rate (i.e. the noise floor) achieved in frequency selective channels. The proposed OEC-II is based on fountain codes. The key element in OEC-II is to exchange the modulation order with the discarded subcarriers. In such case, the system can increase the noise floor by only taking care of the sub-carriers with high energy. By transmitting a fountain-encoded packet over a single sub-carrier, the packets can be discarded if they have encountered a low-energy channel. Fountain codes can recover the source data by only using the surviving packets. With the same effective transmission data rate (i.e. 10.8 Mbits/s), OEC-II with QAM-16 has a SNR gain of around 7 dB over the FEC layer from the IEEE 802.11a standard, around 8 dB over the FEC layer from the IEEE 802.11n standard, around 7 dB over OEC-II with QPSK and around 3 dB over OEC-II with QAM-64.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5648991","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05648991.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5648991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","startPage":"282","endPage":"287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust cross coding scheme for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5648991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust cross coding scheme for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5648991/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732746","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5648991/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust cross coding scheme for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"50c11569297810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09451S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5648991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5648997,"authors":[{"name":"Daisuke Shimbo","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Research and Development Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Nagaokakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Shimbo","id":"37590922900"},{"name":"Ikuo Oka","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Osaka City University, Sumiyoshi, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ikuo","lastName":"Oka","id":"37297497200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5648997","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Error probability","Frequency modulation","Correlation","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","error statistics","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation classification","amplitude moments","OFDM systems","adaptive modulation systems","receiver","transmitter","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","frequency offset","intercarrier interference","ICI components","classification error probability"]}],"abstract":"In adaptive modulation systems, the receiver should identify the modulation employed at the transmitter.

In the first step, the optimal solution is found via the Lagrange multiplier method. However, the optimal solution is infeasible. In the second step, a suboptimal solution is achieved based on the optimal solution in the first step.

A genomic encoding of corner-based shapes is introduced and, taking advantage of a robust genetic-based search algorithm, sets of corners pertaining to objects of interest are mapped into common models.

It is based on the introduced concept of kinetostatic danger field, a quantity that captures the complete state of the robot - its configuration and velocity. The field itself is invariant with respect to objects around the robot and can be computed in any given point of the workspace using measurements from the proprioceptive sensors. Moreover, all the computation can be performed in closed form, yielding compact algebraic expressions that allow for real time applications. The danger field is not only a meaningful indicator about the risk in the vicinity of the robot, but can also be fed back within control skills that implement some well known safety strategies like collision avoidance and virtual impedance control, provided that some environment perception is available in order to determine the points where the field should be computed. Kinematic redundancy for simultaneous task performance and danger minimization can be exploited. The methodology described in the paper is supported with simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5649124","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05649124.pdf","startPage":"2169","endPage":"2174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5649124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kinetostatic danger field - a novel safety assessment for human-robot interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Kinetostatic danger field - a novel safety assessment for human-robot interaction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689447","htmlLink":"/document/5649124/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kinetostatic danger field - a novel safety assessment for human-robot interaction","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058492S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5649124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5649141,"authors":[{"name":"Shaun Gleason","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Shaun","lastName":"Gleason","id":"37269479500"},{"name":"Regina Ferrell","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Regina","lastName":"Ferrell","id":"37605537300"},{"name":"Anil Cheriyadat","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Cheriyadat","id":"37269376800"},{"name":"Raju Vatsavai","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Raju","lastName":"Vatsavai","id":"37064022700"},{"name":"Soumya De","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Soumya","lastName":"De","id":"37895792400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5649141","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic information extraction from multispectral geospatial imagery via a flexible framework","abstract":"Identification and automatic labeling of facilities in high-resolution satellite images is a challenging task as the current thematic classification schemes and the low-level image features are not good enough to capture complex objects and their spatial relationships.

In this paper, we are interested in characterizing the global properties of the iS-graph in terms of percolation on the infinite plane. We prove the existence of a phase transition in the Poisson iS-graph, whereby an unbounded component of securely connected nodes suddenly arises as we increase the density of legitimate nodes. Our work shows that long-range communication in a wireless network is still possible when a secrecy constraint is present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11732896","htmlLink":"/document/5649155/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Continuum percolation in the intrinsically secure communications graph","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuum percolation in the intrinsically secure communications graph","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"62c41569316317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096692S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5649171,"authors":[{"name":"Motoi Iwata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoi","lastName":"Iwata","id":"37548412500"},{"name":"Tomoki Hori","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Hori","id":"37593758100"},{"name":"Akira Shiozaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Shiozaki","id":"37326096400"},{"name":"Akio Ogihara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Ogihara","id":"37565113600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649171","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":652},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649171","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Transform coding","Watermarking","Image coding","Pixel","Quantization","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","image watermarking","object detection","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital watermarking method","tamper detection","tamper recovery","JPEG images","digital contents","RS code","quantized DCT coefficients","image quality"]}],"abstract":"Digital watermarking is a technique that embeds additional data into digital contents so that the distortion by embedding them is imperceptible, where the additional data are called watermark. One of the applications of digital watermarking is tamper detection and recovery. The digital watermarking methods for tamper detection and recovery can detect the tampered region in a tampered image and recover it. In this application, the digital watermarking methods solve the problem that digital contents can be tampered so that the falsification is not detected. In this manuscript, we propose a new method for tamper detection and recovery of JPEG images by using a RS code. The proposed method embeds the check symbols corresponding to an information-reduced original image into the LSBs of the quantized DCT coefficients in a JPEG image directly. Therefore the method completely extracts the embedded data from watermarked JPEG images. We investigated the performance of the proposed method in view of the image quality and the ability of tamper detection and recovery. The experiments of the image quality confirmed the imperceptibility of watermarked images and images used for recovery. The experiments of the ability of tamper detection and recovery confirmed the maximum size of recoverable tampered region and the difficulty of undetectable falsification.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649171","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649171.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"314","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital watermarking method for tamper detection and recovery of JPEG images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Digital watermarking method for tamper detection and recovery of JPEG images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649171/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732800","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital watermarking method for tamper detection and recovery of JPEG images","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"55c21569318879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057216S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5649175,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Thanh Hiep","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Pham Thanh","lastName":"Hiep","id":"37590101400"},{"name":"Ryuji Kohno","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuji","lastName":"Kohno","id":"37274904400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649175","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Repeaters","Channel capacity","MIMO","Propagation losses","Transceivers","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","decode and forward communication","MIMO communication","radio repeaters","radiowave propagation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode-and-forward scheme","distributed MIMO repeater system","multiple-input multiple-output repeater systems","antenna element","keyhole propagation environment","channel capacity","link quality","MIMO transceiver","upper bound"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) repeater systems have been discussed in several published papers.

However, their combination with the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) schemes requires further study since new strategies of cooperation are expected when the MIMO component is added to the cooperation scheme construction. In this paper, we propose a double-layer space-time (DLST) code in a distributed way between the relays in order to emulate the MIMO transmission scheme between the relays. The DLST is compared with some of the most promising codes found in the literature. We show that the proposed code is very efficient whatever the transmitted powers by the relays are. This efficiency is verified in both amplify and forward (AF) and decode and forward (DF) algorithms. We show that a gain of at least 1 dB is obtained through DLST compared to conventional MIMO schemes in cooperative communications whatever the transmission scenario is.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649193","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649193.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient space-time block codes for cooperative MIMO communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649193/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient space-time block codes for cooperative MIMO communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732828","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649193/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient space-time block codes for cooperative MIMO communications","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"66c41569319001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058285S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649214,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Qiuju Diao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Qiuju","lastName":"Diao","id":"37589745300"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37067204800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649214","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Null space","Arrays","Matrix decomposition","Generators","Polynomials","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circulant decomposition","quasi-cyclic codes","circular parity-check matrix","cyclic Euclidean geometry LDPC codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649214","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649214.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649214","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circulant decomposition: Cyclic, quasi-cyclic and LDPC codes","abstract":"This paper shows that a cyclic code can be put into quasi-cyclic form by decomposing a circular parity-check matrix through column and row permutations.

The top performing approaches in this comparison are those that rely on flexible part-based representations and discriminatively trained part detectors. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrate that by combining multiple models we can increase the reliability of the system. We also demonstrate that the detection performance can be substantially improved by integrating the height and pitch information provided by on-board sensors.

State-of-the-art Local Positioning Systems (LPS) require a complex sensor-network infrastructure to locate with enough accuracy and coverage. Alternatively, Inertial Measuring Units (IMU) can be used to estimate the movement of a person; a methodology that is called Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR). In this paper, we describe and implement a Kalman-based framework, called INS-EKF-ZUPT (IEZ), to estimate the position and attitude of a person while walking. IEZ makes use of an Extended Kalman filter (EKF), an INS mechanization algorithm, a Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) methodology, as well as, a stance detection algorithm. As the IEZ methodology is not able to estimate the heading and its drift (non-observable variables), then several methods are used for heading drift reduction: ZARU, HDR and Compass. The main contribution of the paper is the integration of the heading drift reduction algorithms into a Kalman-based IEZ platform, which represents an extended PDR methodology (IEZ+) valid for operation in indoor spaces with local magnetic disturbances. The IEZ+ PDR methodology was tested in several simulated and real indoor scenarios with a low-performance IMU mounted on the foot. The positioning errors were about 1% of the total travelled distance, which are good figures if compared with other works using IMUs of higher performance.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2010.5649300","publicationTitle":"2010 7th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 7th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5647780/5649084/05649300.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2010.5649300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649084","startPage":"135","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor pedestrian navigation using an INS/EKF framework for yaw drift reduction and a foot-mounted IMU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Indoor pedestrian navigation using an INS/EKF framework for yaw drift reduction and a foot-mounted IMU","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649300/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11688453","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649300/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor pedestrian navigation using an INS/EKF framework for yaw drift reduction and a foot-mounted IMU","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049616S","chronDate":"11-12 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5647780","isNumber":"5649084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5647780","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"5649084","articleId":"5649300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":5649344,"authors":[{"name":"Vesna Garda\u0161evi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Vesna","lastName":"Garda\u0161evi\u0107","id":"38032356900"},{"name":"Ralf R.

It is a well-known fact that decreasing the block size reduces the motion-compensated frame difference, and thus reduces the data rate. However, no theoretical evaluations are available to model this relation. This paper derives a model for the prediction error variance of block-based motion compensation algorithms with respect to the block size. It is shown that the variance of the displaced frame difference of a block can be modelled with the pixel position and only three additional parameters. It can be observed that the variance increases almost linearly with the block size.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5649414","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05649414.pdf","startPage":"969","endPage":"972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5649414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block size dependent error model for motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649414/","displayDocTitle":"Block size dependent error model for motion compensation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690943","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649414/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block size dependent error model for motion compensation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102791S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5649414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5649415,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Yi Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Chien-Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599165100"},{"name":"I-Wei Lai","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"I-Wei","lastName":"Lai","id":"37407957700"},{"name":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzi-Dar","lastName":"Chiueh","id":"37273337000"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"},{"name":"Heinrich Meyr","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Heinrich","lastName":"Meyr","id":"37275970000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649415","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Bit error rate","Measurement","Quantization","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","modulation coding","Monte Carlo methods","probability","pseudonoise codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","MIMO BICM-ID","extrinsic LLR","finite-precision extrinsic log-likelihood ratio","demapper output","multiple-input multiple-output bit-interleaved coded modulation","iterative decoding","probability density function","pseudoquantization noise model","PQN model","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the error rate degradation caused by the finite-precision extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR), i.e., demapper output, for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID). A closed-form expression for the probability density function (pdf) of the metric difference with finite precision is derived. This pdf is well-approximated by two approaches, namely the pseudo quantization noise (PQN) model and the pdf tail truncation. Moreover, we interpret such performance degradation as an additional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. As validated by Monte Carlo simulations, this SNR loss can be directly applied at the first iteration, extending our analysis to non-iterative scenario. This work provides a convenient indicator for deciding the LLR precision in real implementations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER analysis for MIMO BICM-ID assuming finite precision of extrinsic LLR","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649415","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649415.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"BER analysis for MIMO BICM-ID assuming finite precision of extrinsic LLR","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649415/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732799","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER analysis for MIMO BICM-ID assuming finite precision of extrinsic LLR","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"23c31569311884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061271S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649417,"authors":[{"name":"James T.

The system is designed such that during flight, the angular rate of a UAV is captured by an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) and is relayed to a pilot controlling the vehicle from inside the motion simulator. Efforts to further increase pilot SA led to the development of a mixed reality chase view piloting interface. Chase view is similar to a view of being towed behind the aircraft. It combines real world onboard camera images with a virtual representation of the vehicle and the surrounding operating environment.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5649417","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05649417.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5649417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","startPage":"2509","endPage":"2510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed reality for unmanned aerial vehicle operations in near Earth environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mixed reality for unmanned aerial vehicle operations in near Earth environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649417/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11689345","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649417/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed reality for unmanned aerial vehicle operations in near Earth environments","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051748S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5649417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5649418,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Volpi","affiliation":["Institute of Geomatics and Analysis of Risk, University of Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Volpi","id":"37586980300"},{"name":"Devis Tuia","affiliation":["Institute of Geomatics and Analysis of Risk, University of Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Devis","lastName":"Tuia","id":"37395181300"},{"name":"Mikhail Kanevski","affiliation":["Institute of Geomatics and Analysis of Risk, University of Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Kanevski","id":"37323232800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5649418","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Pixel","Kernel","Training","Clustering algorithms","Remote sensing","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image sampling","redundancy","reliability","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing image classification","active sampling","semiautomatic selection","training patterns","support vector machine","real valued decision function","diverse sampling","feature space","nonlinear clustering","SVM hyperplane","cluster center","redundancy","kernel k-means algorithm","linear model","reliability","QuickBird VHR image","Zurich","Switzerland"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active learning","batch sampling","redundancy","classification","support vector machines","VHR imagery","kernel k-means"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649418","abstract":"A novel approach to active sampling is proposed for the semi automatic selection of training patterns in a given pool of candidates. In the method proposed, each candidate is ranked with a double criterion: first, informativeness of the candidate is assessed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) real valued decision function. Then, diverse sampling is ensured by considering the relative position of the candidate in the SVM feature space. Such position is evaluated by using partitioning of the feature space via nonlinear clustering. Among all candidates belonging to the same cluster, the winner is the pixel minimizing the weighted combination of the distances from both the SVM hyperplane and the cluster center. This way, the proposed approach provides a way to i) account for and minimize the redundancy of the sampled pixels and ii) maximize the speed of convergence to an optimal classification accuracy. In order to discover clusters and to evaluate the distance between the cluster center and the samples, the kernel k-means algorithm is used in a hierarchical way. By its kernel nature, the algorithm partitions data in the SVM induced space, thus ensuring coherent diversity with respect to the linear model therein. The reliability of the proposed heuristic is evaluated on a QuickBird VHR image of the city of Zurich, Switzerland.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649418","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1417","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05649418.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced active sampling for remote sensing image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Advanced active sampling for remote sensing image classification","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649418/","accessionNumber":"11686385","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649418/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced active sampling for remote sensing image classification","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0001414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044323S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5649418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5649423,"authors":[{"name":"Gaohuan Lv","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Gaohuan","lastName":"Lv","id":"37604452100"},{"name":"Kaizhi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Kaizhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37290493000"},{"name":"Xingzhao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xingzhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280574800"},{"name":"Wenxian Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Wenxian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37405648000"},{"name":"Guozhong Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Guozhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37557250800"},{"name":"Junli Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Junli","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600059400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5649423","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Imaging","Azimuth","Image resolution","Algorithm design and analysis","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reciprocal spectrum algorithm","radar imaging","frequency sampling waveform","azimuth direction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RSA","RDA","correlation coefficient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649423","abstract":"A radar imaging algorithm named reciprocal spectrum algorithm (RSA) is proposed in this paper to get higher resolution in azimuth direction with frequency sampling waveform.

A realization is a set of planar positions for a team of robots with a connectivity graph that is identical to an a priori given connectivity graph with the additional constraint that it must be feasible. Feasibility means that that the robots must not be overlapping with each other. As the associated mathematical problem is known to be NP-hard, a stochastic approach based on genetic algorithms is proposed. First, a population set based on randomly generated planar and feasible multi-robot positions is generated. Next, a fitness function that measures the similarity of the graph of each member is constructed. Finally, new reproduction operators that enable the evolution of generations are introduced. An extensive statistical study with different number of robots demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain fairly complicated network topologies.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5649449","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05649449.pdf","startPage":"5163","endPage":"5168","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5649449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planar multi-robot realizations of connectivity graphs using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Planar multi-robot realizations of connectivity graphs using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11689508","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649449/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar multi-robot realizations of connectivity graphs using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057421S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5649449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5649459,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Informationtheorie und Theoretische Informationtechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"},{"name":"Brendan Farrell","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Informationtheorie und Theoretische Informationtechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Farrell","id":"37592486900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649459","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Receivers","Ink","Computer aided software engineering","Integrated circuits","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signals","information bearing signals","tone reservation","peak-to-average power ratio constraint","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"We consider the performance of tone reservation for reduction of the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM signals.

However, one major drawback of the RM-PTS scheme is high computational loads which also occur in the PTS scheme for finding the transmitted signal with minimum PAPR out. Therefore, this paper investigates a suboptimal PAPR reduction method with low computational loads by using the improved genetic algorithm used the partheno-crossover operator (PCGA) as the selection mechanism of RM-PTS scheme. The GA-PTS scheme is an active PAPR reduction method, which has better PAPR performance than the GD-PTS scheme and has lower computational load than the PTS scheme and the GD-PTS scheme. Note that the GA-PTS scheme has no error correction capability and is a suboptimal PAPR reduction method. Based on the same computational loads, the RM-PCGA-PTS scheme with natural ordering has better PAPR performance than the GA-PTS scheme with adjacent partition in simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649479","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified genetic algorithm PTS technique with error correction for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A modified genetic algorithm PTS technique with error correction for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649479/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732898","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649479/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified genetic algorithm PTS technique with error correction for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"188c11569310551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082699S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5649494,"authors":[{"name":"Kaijen Hsiao","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaijen","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"38252616300"},{"name":"Sachin Chitta","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Chitta","id":"37279717300"},{"name":"Matei Ciocarlie","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matei","lastName":"Ciocarlie","id":"37297485500"},{"name":"E.

In this work, we propose a simple but robust approach to grasp selection for unknown objects, and a reactive adjustment approach to deal with uncertainty in object location and shape. The grasp selection method uses 3D sensor data directly to determine a ranked set of grasps for objects in a scene, using heuristics based on both the overall shape of the object and its local features. The reactive grasping approach uses tactile feedback from fingertip sensors to execute a compliant robust grasp. We present experimental results to validate our approach by grasping a wide range of unknown objects. Our results show that reactive grasping can correct for a fair amount of uncertainty in the measured position or shape of the objects, and that our grasp selection approach is successful in grasping objects with a variety of shapes.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5649494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5649494","startPage":"1228","endPage":"1235","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05649494.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contact-reactive grasping of objects with partial shape information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Contact-reactive grasping of objects with partial shape information","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649494/","accessionNumber":"11689363","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649494/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact-reactive grasping of objects with partial shape information","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057213S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5649494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":5649511,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In TDD system, supporting asymmetrical traffic can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of downlink and uplink transmission period. Nevertheless, the intercell interference may be deteriorated by the cross-slot interference resulting from the different downlink and uplink ratios among neighboring cells. Although the FFR technique can overcome the inter-cell interference, the impact of the cross-slot interference of TDD systems due to various downlink to uplink traffic ratios in different cells on the inner region size of a FFR-based OFDMA system is an open issue to our best knowledge. Intuitively, the larger the inner region of a FFR system, the higher the system capacity. Thus, this paper can provide a systematic method to determine the size of the inner region of FFR-based OFDMA system for different ratios of the downlink to uplink traffic among two neighbor cells.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649531","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649531.pdf","startPage":"969","endPage":"974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage performance analysis for fractional frequency reused TDD-OFDMA systems with asymmetric traffics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649531/","displayDocTitle":"Outage performance analysis for fractional frequency reused TDD-OFDMA systems with asymmetric traffics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732874","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649531/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage performance analysis for fractional frequency reused TDD-OFDMA systems with asymmetric traffics","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"173c31569318937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046081S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5649540,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Lin","lastName":"Ku","id":"37602473400"},{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280758200"},{"name":"Yu-Ted Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ted","lastName":"Su","id":"37276451400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649540","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Optimization","Resource management","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","cognitive radio","iterative methods","optimisation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multiuser beamforming","power allocation","hierarchical cognitive radio system","antenna beamforming","hierarchical CR system","microcellular system","dynamic spectrum access","interference management","maximum allowable interference power","signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio","SINR","iterative rate maximization algorithm","IRM algorithm","CR base station"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we jointly design antenna beamforming and power allocation to maximize the sum rate for multiple users in a hierarchical cognitive radio (CR) system, where an underlying microcellular system adopts dynamic spectrum access techniques to reuse the same spectrum of a macrocellular system. One challenge in this kind of hierarchical CR systems is the interference management between the macrocell and the microcell. We suggest utilizing the antenna beamforming technique to overcome the interference between the macrocell and the microcell, while maximizing the achievable sum rate of the underlying CR microcellular system. We formulate an optimization problem to achieve the objective of maximizing sum rate subject to the constraints of the maximum allowable interference power to the primary system, the minimum required signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) for the secondary users, and the maximum transmission power for the underlying CR base station (BS). An iterative rate maximization (IRM) algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution. This developed methodology provides an important insight into the design of an optimal hierarchical CR system for various numbers of users as well as cell coverage.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649540","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649540.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649540","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","startPage":"946","endPage":"951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal multiuser beamforming and power allocation for hierarchical cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal multiuser beamforming and power allocation for hierarchical cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649540/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732900","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal multiuser beamforming and power allocation for hierarchical cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"169c41569318961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082852S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5649545,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Jeong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37577459600"},{"name":"Tony Q.

The IR for the QKD can be seen as the asymmetric Slepian-Wolf problem, which low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can solve with efficient algorithms, i.e., the belief propagation. However, the LDPC codes are needed to be chosen properly from a collection of codes optimized for multiple key rates, which leads to complex decoder devices and performance degradation for unoptimized key rates. Therefore, it is desired that establish an IR scheme with a single LDPC code which supports multiple rates. To this end, in this paper, we propose an IR scheme with a rate-compatible non-binary LDPC code. Numerical results show the proposed scheme achieves IR efficiency comparable to the best know conventional IR scheme with lower decoding error rates.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649550.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information reconciliation for QKD with rate-compatible non-binary LDPC codes","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Information reconciliation for QKD with rate-compatible non-binary LDPC codes","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732872","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649550/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information reconciliation for QKD with rate-compatible non-binary LDPC codes","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"165c51569319053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101448S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5649559,"authors":[{"name":"Samira Bouyagoub","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Samira","lastName":"Bouyagoub","id":"38558425400"},{"name":"David R.

This paper presents a new noise-resistant subband decomposition BSS/ICA approach for hyperspectral unmixing. Subband decomposition BSS relaxes the assumption that the source signals are mutual independent, which has been proved successful in some BSS applications. However, the existing subband decomposition and subband selection methods emphasize the \u201cindependence\u201d of sub-components, but ignore the impact of their \u201cnoise\u201d. It is well known that most subband decomposition such as wavelet and fourier transforms have been successfully used for noise removal, so simultaneously considering independence and noise through subband decomposition is possible. In this paper, we propose wavelet package transform for subband decomposition, independence-and-noise joint measure based ranking method for subband selection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods are promising in hyperspectral unmixing.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649568","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05649568.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","startPage":"983","endPage":"986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise-robust subband decomposition blind signal separation for hyperspectral unmixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noise-robust subband decomposition blind signal separation for hyperspectral unmixing","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649568/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11686530","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649568/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-robust subband decomposition blind signal separation for hyperspectral unmixing","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0000983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074749S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5649568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649570,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghong Mo","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ronghong","lastName":"Mo","id":"37285561700"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Huat","lastName":"Chew","id":"37280653600"},{"name":"Tony Q.

In our proposed design, the precoding matrix for an individual link is given as the product of two matrices obtained in two sequential steps. In particular, the first matrix is derived by maximizing the desired signal power given the leakage power as a penalty and the second matrix is obtained by suppressing the interference among data streams belonging to one link (inter-stream interference). Comparing to the naive precoding design, where each transmitter selfishly employs waterfilling transmission scheme, the achievable rate achieved by our proposed two-step precoding design increases as the SNR increases.

For the iterative MIMO demapping and turbo decoding, the convergence behavior by using the informed asynchronous scheduling is first demonstrated to be similar to the standard sequential scheduling. As the extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation at both the MIMO demapper and turbo decoder costs high complexity, an informed message update (IMU) rule is further proposed to select only a subset of extrinsic LLRs for updates within each iteration. By avoiding the re-calculations for the extrinsic LLRs with small changes between successive iterations, significant complexity savings are achieved with negligible error rate performance loss.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649576","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649576.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed message update for iterative MIMO demapping and turbo decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649576/","displayDocTitle":"Informed message update for iterative MIMO demapping and turbo decoding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732923","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649576/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informed message update for iterative MIMO demapping and turbo decoding","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"156c11569316113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068349S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649577,"authors":[{"name":"Redha M.

We assume a channel fading block accommodates at least one codeword so that for block Rayleigh fading, the ergodic channel capacity is zero when no CSI is available at the transmitter. The CSI fed back to the transmitter is subject to a cardinality constraint. We derive a counting function to describe an efficient use of the available cardinality by formulating the capacity loss due to limited cardinality as a variational calculus problem. The feedback schemes with different cardinality constraints can be easily derived by scaling the counting function to fit the cardinality constraints. With Rayleigh fading channels, the feedback scheme and the corresponding lower bound of maximum expected rate can be solved in closed form. According to our results, the expected rate achieved by using the counting function is tight.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","startPage":"807","endPage":"811","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649612.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block fading channels with limited channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Switches","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Channel capacity","Channel coding","Calculus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited channel state information","lower bound","CSI","ergodic channel capacity","transmitter","cardinality constraint","counting function","feedback schemes","block Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Block fading channels with limited channel state information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649612/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649612/","accessionNumber":"11732752","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block fading channels with limited channel state information","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"144c21569318995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064448S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649637,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Yi Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Elec.

Under such a practical constraint, the path deletion policy that is required when the stack exceeds its upper limit becomes essential in performance and decoding complexity. We then examined several path deletion schemes for sequential-type decoding algorithms that can produce decoding outputs in an on-the-fly fashion. Our result indicates that path deletion based on Fano metric in most cases can achieve better performance when the memory saving is critical in system design. In case the decoding process is allowed to start after the reception of the entire received word, we proposed an alternative path deletion scheme based on a two-pass decoding structure, in which the backward pass estimates the heuristic function in terms of the M-algorithm for use of the forward decoding search. As the M-algorithm can be hardware-implemented, only the computational complexity of the forward pass is accounted. Simulation results show that the computational complexity of the forward pass not only outperforms the stack algorithm with Fano metric but is smaller than that of the two-pass super-code decoder proposed in [9].","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649637","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649637.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"761","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path deletions for finite stack-size sequential-type decoding algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Path deletions for finite stack-size sequential-type decoding algorithms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649637/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732804","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path deletions for finite stack-size sequential-type decoding algorithms","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"135c11569291059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065284S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5649639,"authors":[{"name":"N.D.

The main property that makes these signals robust against ICI is that they allow to employ time-frequency well localized pulses, particularly Gaussian pulse which has the best time-frequency localization. However, this property also suppresses the outband or inband spectral leakage of the BFDM and BFDM/OQAM signal, making them attractive physical layer modulation scheme for cognitive radio.

However, severe intercarrier interference (ICI) coming from high mobility of user equipment corrupts the orthogonality of the OFDM and pulls down the system performance. From the analysis of the ICI channel matrix, it is revealed that the interference can be effectively bounded in finite double-side subcarriers centering the desired subcarrier. In this paper, we propose bi-directional decision feedback equalizer (BD-DFE) to tackle ICI problem for the mobile MIMO-OFDM system. The equalizer consists of two-part equalizers. The upper part uses DFE to output tentative decisions. The lower part employs BD-DFE aiming to cancel both pre- and post-cursor ICI to give a finial symbol estimates. In so doing, double-sided ICI can be removed more completely. Simulation results show that our proposed receiver for the mobile OFDM system provides good tradeoffs between receiver performance and computational load.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649677","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649677.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional decision feedback equalization for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649677/","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional decision feedback equalization for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732840","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649677/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional decision feedback equalization for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"120c41569318981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039079S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5649681,"authors":[{"name":"Eisuke Sakai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Eisuke","lastName":"Sakai","id":"37603616200"},{"name":"Haruki Nishimura","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruki","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37600948400"},{"name":"Mamiko Inamori","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamiko","lastName":"Inamori","id":"37403587500"},{"name":"Yukitosi Sanada","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukitosi","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37269451300"},{"name":"Mohammad Ghavami","affiliation":["Division of Engineering, UWB Communications Group, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Ghavami","id":"37269414700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649681","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM","Bit error rate","Delay","Channel estimation","Channel models","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity sampling point selection","OFDM receiver","fractional sampling scheme","diversity gain","estimation accuracy","channel estimation","DFT block","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"To achieve diversity with a single antenna, a fractional sampling (FS) scheme in OFDM has been investigated. In addition, to obtain more diversity gain through FS, a sampling point selection (SPS) scheme has been proposed. However, it requires a large number of multiplication operations for the SPS. This leads to large power consumption and costs for additional circuits. In this paper, a low-complexity SPS scheme is proposed. There is the trade-off between the diversity gain and the estimation accuracy. The serial process of the channel estimation requires only a DFT block with the size of N/4 as the additional circuit.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649681","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640322/5648872/05649681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648872","startPage":"662","endPage":"667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity sampling point selection in OFDM receiver with fractional sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity sampling point selection in OFDM receiver with fractional sampling","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649681/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732885","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649681/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity sampling point selection in OFDM receiver with fractional sampling","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"118c21569298881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08404S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640322","isNumber":"5648872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640322","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648872","articleId":"5649681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5649682,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Yao Chen","affiliation":["Institutes of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Yao","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Wen-Kang Jia","affiliation":["Institutes of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Kang","lastName":"Jia"},{"name":"Yaw-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Institutes of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yaw-Chung","lastName":"Chen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649682","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Neodymium","Error correction","Receivers","Bit error rate","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cyclic redundancy check codes","error correction","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access","wireless transmission technology","frame check sequence","padding overhead","MAC frames","CRC based error correction scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)","Error Correction","OFDM","OFDMA","Padding"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDM/OFDMA) based wireless transmission technology has been widely accepted by consumers.

The basic tasks performed within any of these fields are target or anomaly detection, classification or clustering, change detection, and physical parameter estimation. Hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis in any field often involves mathematically transforming the raw data into a new space using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or similar techniques. The dimensionality of this new space is usually smaller than the collected space and as a result reduces computation time of subsequent algorithms. Additionally and more importantly, the results of standard algorithms may perform better in this new, uncor-related space. Many of the currently used transformations in HSI analysis are statistical in nature and therefore place Gaussian or similar assumptions on the data distribution. These assumptions work well with remote sensing imagery with low spectral and/or spatial resolution. In low resolution imagery, each pixel is a mixture of many materials and the data distribution is often sufficiently represented by statistical distributions. However, as the current generation sensors typically have higher spatial and/or spectral resolution, the complexity of the data collected is increasing and these assumptions are no longer adequate. As a result, algorithms based on these statistical transformations do not necessarily provide improved results on modern datasets. A new, data driven, mathematical transformation is presented as a preprocessing step for HSI analysis. Termed the Nearest Neighbor Transformation, this new transformation does not rely on placing assumptions on the data and may improve analytical results from standard HSI anomaly detection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WNYIPW.2010.5649762","publicationTitle":"2010 Western New York Image Processing Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Western New York Image Processing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640101/5649731/05649762.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNYIPW.2010.5649762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5649731","startPage":"26","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A euclidean distance transformation for improved anomaly detection in spectral imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A euclidean distance transformation for improved anomaly detection in spectral imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Nov. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649762/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-5 Nov. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732925","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5649762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A euclidean distance transformation for improved anomaly detection in spectral imagery","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"114schlamm2629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050372S","chronDate":"5-5 Nov. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640101","isNumber":"5649731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5649731","articleId":"5649762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5649775,"authors":[{"name":"Heesung Kwon","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, RDRL-SES-E, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Heesung","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37346486000"},{"name":"Prudhvi Gurram","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, RDRL-SES-E, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Prudhvi","lastName":"Gurram","id":"37398980300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9566-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9565-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9564-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"5649775","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Bandwidth","Hyperspectral imaging","Detectors","Cost function","Clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","geophysical image processing","image classification","object detection","radial basis function networks","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal kernel bandwidth estimation","hyperspectral kernel-based anomaly detection","kernel-based anomaly detection technique","Kernel RX algorithm","prescreening tool","anomalous pixel spectra","hyperspectral images","anomalous spectra","reference spectral information","supervised classification/detection techniques","Gaussian radial basis function","kernel parameters","Gaussian RBF kernel","optimal full diagonal bandwidth parameters","cross-validation technique","optimal single bandwidth parameter","full diagonal parameters","spectral bands","false alarm rate","suboptimal bandwidth parameters","hyperspectral imagery","military target detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Hyperspectral Images","Kernel RX algorithm","Kernel Parameter Optimization"]}],"abstract":"A kernel-based anomaly detection technique called Kernel RX algorithm has been developed earlier by one of the authors, to be used as a prescreening tool that non-linearly detects anomalous pixel spectra in hyperspectral images. Targets of interest are then identified among the prescreened anomalous spectra based on reference spectral information using supervised classification/detection techniques. Kernel RX algorithm uses kernels like the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel to transform the given data into higher-dimensional (possibly infinite) feature space before detecting the anomalies. The efficiency of the algorithm depends on this transformation which in turn depends on the respective kernel parameters. The Gaussian RBF kernel has a parameter called bandwidth parameter. In this paper, a new method to determine the optimal full diagonal bandwidth parameters of the Gaussian RBF kernel is presented. First, cross-validation technique is used to estimate an optimal single bandwidth parameter. Then, the full diagonal parameters are estimated from this single parameter using the variances of the spectral bands of the hyperspectral image. It will be shown that the optimal full diagonal bandwidth parameters provide a better probability of detection at a given false alarm rate compared to the optimal single bandwidth parameter and other suboptimal bandwidth parameters when tested on hyperspectral imagery for military target detection.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649775","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639672/5648802/05649775.pdf","startPage":"2812","endPage":"2815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal kernel bandwidth estimation for hyperspectral kernel-based anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649775/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal kernel bandwidth estimation for hyperspectral kernel-based anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11686505","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649775/","conferenceDate":"25-30 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal kernel bandwidth estimation for hyperspectral kernel-based anomaly detection","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0002812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044033S","chronDate":"25-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639672","isNumber":"5648802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639672","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5648802","articleId":"5649775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5649822,"authors":[{"name":"Yiting Liao","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Yiting","lastName":"Liao","id":"37574811100"},{"name":"Athanasios Leontaris","affiliation":["Image technology Research, Dolby Laboratories, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Leontaris","id":"37272645200"},{"name":"Alexis M.

For the control center, a detector based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GRLT) is introduced and compared with conventional bad detection detection schemes.

Given the large variation in the appearances and locations of doors and door handles, this is a challenging perception and control problem; but this capability will significantly enlarge the range of environments that our robots can autonomously navigate through. In this paper, we focus on the case of doors with door handles. We propose an approach that, rather than trying to build a full 3d model of the door/door handle-which is challenging because of occlusion, specularity of many door handles, and the limited accuracy of our 3d sensors-instead uses computer vision to choose a manipulation strategy. Specifically, it uses an image of the door handle to identify a small number of \u201c3d key locations,\u201d such as the axis of rotation of the door handle, and the location of the end-point of the door-handle. These key locations then completely define a trajectory for the robot end-effector (hand) that successfully turns the door handle and opens the door. Evaluated on a large set of doors that the robot had not previously seen, it successfully opened 31 out of 34 doors. We also show that this approach of using vision to identify a small number of key locations also generalizes to a range of other tasks, including turning a thermostat knob, pulling open a drawer, and pushing elevator buttons.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Robot sensing systems","Cameras","Trajectory","Feature extraction","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end effectors","image sensors","mobile robots","position control","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot end-effector","perception problem","control problem","3d sensors","computer vision","3d key locations","thermostat knob"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2010.5649847","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5639431/5648787/05649847.pdf","startPage":"2751","endPage":"2757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2010.5649847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to open new doors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to open new doors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649847/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649847/","accessionNumber":"11689626","conferenceDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to open new doors","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050658S","chronDate":"18-22 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5639431","isNumber":"5648787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5639431","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5648787","articleId":"5649847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5649852,"authors":[{"name":"Haruhiko Kaneko","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruhiko","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37433298000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6017-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6016-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649852","dbTime":"51 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Gallium","Decoding","Encoding","Error correction codes","Complexity theory","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","decoding","error statistics","Gaussian distribution","genetic algorithms","graph theory","Hamming codes","matrix algebra","parallel processing","parity check codes","search problems","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed video coding","nonbinary LDPC code","probabilistic search","genetic algorithm","GA","nonbinary low-density parity-check code","error probability distribution","Gaussian distribution","Laplace distribution","LDPC matrix","approximation method","Tanner graph","Hamming weight","personal computer","decoded symbol error rate","SER"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649852","abstract":"This paper examines the applicability of the genetic algorithm (GA) to generation of nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over GF(q) which is suitable for distributed video coding (DVC).

Using pilot symbols, an initial least-squares estimate of the phase noise is obtained. The initial estimate is iteratively improved by also exploiting the soft decisions from the data symbols, obtained in a previous iteration. We demonstrate that the resulting (linearized) mean-square estimation error consists of two contributions: a contribution from the additive channel noise, that equals the modified Cramer-Rao lower bound when the soft decisions are assumed to equal the true data symbols, and a contribution that results from the phase noise modeling error. The modified Cramer-Rao lower bound is shown to be proportional to the number of estimated DCT coefficients. Performance can be optimized by a proper selection of the number of DCT coefficients in the expansion of the phasor. Iterative soft-decision-directed phase noise estimation yields a considerable performance improvement as compared to estimation using only pilot symbols. For an OFDM system with strong phase noise, the BER performance degradation resulting from the proposed scheme is limited to about 1 dB only.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5649866","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5640355/5648820/05649866.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.2010.5649866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase noise estimation and compensation for OFDM systems: A DCT-based approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649866/","displayDocTitle":"Phase noise estimation and compensation for OFDM systems: A DCT-based approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11732709","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649866/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase noise estimation and compensation for OFDM systems: A DCT-based approach","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"18c41569316847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054736S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5640355","isNumber":"5648820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5640355","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5648820","articleId":"5649866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649921,"authors":[{"name":"Mahinsasa Narayana","affiliation":["Northumbria University, UK"],"firstName":"Mahinsasa","lastName":"Narayana","id":"37398676500"},{"name":"Ghanim Putrus","affiliation":["Northumbria University, UK"],"firstName":"Ghanim","lastName":"Putrus","id":"37281716600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9565570-2-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7667-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9565570-0-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5649921","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind turbines","Rotors","Wind speed","Generators","Torque","Aerodynamics","Velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity measurement","autoregressive moving average processes","electric generators","neural nets","optimal control","rotors","sensorless machine control","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal control","neural networks","wind turbine generator","wind rotor curve","electrical generator curve","wind speed measurements","nonlinear autoregressive moving average process","sensorless control","wind speed sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum Power Point Tracking","NARMA-L2 controller","Permanent-magnet generator","Variable-speed wind turbines"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649921","abstract":"Variable-speed, fixed-pitch wind turbines are required to optimize power output performance without the aerodynamic controls. In steady-state, a wind turbine generator system is operated such that the optimum points of wind rotor curve and electrical generator curve coincide. In order to obtain maximum power output of a wind turbine generator system, it is necessary to drive the wind turbine at an optimal rotor speed for a particular wind speed. Therefore, accurate wind speed measurements are required for optimal operation of the wind turbine. In practice, it is difficult to accurately measure wind speed by an anemometer installed closed to the wind turbine, because the wind turbine experience different forces due to wake rotation. Therefore, it is useful to use a wind speed sensor less control strategy. In this study, a Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average (NARMA) neural network model is used to identify the combined performance of the wind rotor and generator. Wind speed sensorless optimum control strategy is introduced and comparison study is preformed with a controller that employs a wind speed sensor.

The results show that the ensemble NN model has potential for further application to other PD scenarios.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5637220/5648789/05649945.pdf","publicationTitle":"45th International Universities Power Engineering Conference UPEC2010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ensemble Neural Network for recognizing PD patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Partial discharges","Discharges","Training","Corona","Voltage measurement","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulation testing","neural nets","partial discharge measurement","pattern recognition","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PD pattern recognition","insulation diagnosis","partial discharge pattern recognition","ensemble neural network system","ensemble NN","statistical parameter","PD measurement","point-to-plane geometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial Discharge","Corona Discharge","Neural Network","High Voltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"An ensemble Neural Network for recognizing PD patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649945/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11688088","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ensemble Neural Network for recognizing PD patterns","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"C418211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047796S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5637220","isNumber":"5648789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5637220","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5648789","articleId":"5649945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Cardiff University","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5649961,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Miravet","affiliation":["SENER Ingenier\u00eda y Sistemas, Tres Cantos (Madrid), SPAIN","Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Madrid, SPAIN"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Miravet","id":"37869762900"},{"name":"Francisco B.

The first step, devoted to increase the sampling rate of the incoming images, is performed by fitting linear combinations of functions generated from principal components (PC) to reproduce locally the sparse projected image data, and using these models to estimate image values at nodes of the high-resolution grid. PCs were obtained from local image patches sampled at sub-pixel level, which were generated in turn from a database of high-resolution images by application of a physically realistic observation model. Continuity between local image models is enforced by minimizing an adequate functional in the space of model coefficients. The second step, dealing with restoration, is performed by a linear filter with coefficients learned to restore residual interpolation artifacts in addition to low-resolution blurring, providing an effective coupling between both steps of the method. Results on a demanding five-image scanned sequence of graphics and text are presented, showing the excellent performance of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art two-step and Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori SR algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05649961.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5649961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5649961","startPage":"2025","endPage":"2028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PCA-based super-resolution algorithm for short image sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649961/","displayDocTitle":"A PCA-based super-resolution algorithm for short image sequences","htmlLink":"/document/5649961/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11690971","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PCA-based super-resolution algorithm for short image sequences","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0002025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064719S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5649961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5649973,"authors":[{"name":"Ayhan Yaz\u0131c\u0131","affiliation":["Tubitak Uekae Iltaren B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc \u00dcmitk\u00f6y, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayhan","lastName":"Yaz\u0131c\u0131","id":"38228003600"},{"name":"Ay\u015fin \u00c7etin Hamurcu","affiliation":["Tubitak Uekae Iltaren B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc \u00dcmitk\u00f6y, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ay\u015fin \u00c7etin","lastName":"Hamurcu","id":"38109143100"},{"name":"Buyurman Baykal","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Buyurman","lastName":"Baykal","id":"37271393500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9671-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9672-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9670-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5649973","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"abstract":"Use of multiple transmit and receive antennas have become a popular research area in radar community after the success of the same concept in communication.

Conventionally, one-dimensional ADLWT (1D-ADLWT) has been proposed. However, it requires large amount of computational cost for optimal lifting direction decision and image transformation. In this work, adaptive directional lifting is implemented by using 2D direct lifting wavelet transform and directional downsampling matrices. Direct 2D lifting structure can reduce the computational cost for image transformation and optimal lifting direction decision significantly. Moreover, in the simulation, it is shown that the proposed method is comparable to the 1D-ADLWT in terms of image coding efficiency. Thus, an effective ADLWT with low computational cost can be provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5641636/5648792/05649981.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5649981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2010.5649981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5649981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direction-adaptive image coding using two-dimensional direct lifting wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Wavelet transforms","Computational efficiency","Bismuth","Encoding","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-adaptive image coding","two-dimensional adaptive directional lifting-based wavelet transform","optimal lifting direction decision","image transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive directional lifting","wavelet transform","image coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5649981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A direction-adaptive image coding using two-dimensional direct lifting wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5649981/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11690979","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direction-adaptive image coding using two-dimensional direct lifting wavelet transform","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0000381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071028S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5641636","isNumber":"5648792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5641636","xplore-issue":"5648792","articleId":"5649981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
